    "summary": "Vladimir Putin's aide says the two discussed the possibility of Russia and Ukraine resuming direct talks.",
    "content": "US envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian President Vladimir Putin had \"constructive\" talks in Moscow on Friday lasting three hours, according to an aide of Putin's.\nYuri Ushakov said the possibility of Russia and Ukraine resuming direct talks was a particular point of discussion.\nThe US has not released details of what was discussed during the meeting, but as it took place US President Donald Trump hinted the two sides were close to reaching a deal.\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged allies to apply more pressure on Russia, blaming Moscow for failing to agree to a previous temporary ceasefire presented by the US.\nTraffic was halted as a convoy of cars carrying Witkoff arrived in central Moscow, as he made his fourth visit to Russia since the start of the year.\nThe three-hour talks were described as \"constructive and very useful\" by Putin aide Ushakov.\nIt had brought the \"Russian and US positions closer together not just on Ukraine but also on a range of other international issues\", he said.\n\"Specifically on the Ukrainian crisis, the possibility of resuming direct talks between Russian and Ukrainian representatives was in particular discussed,\" he added.\nEarlier this week,Putin signalled for the first time since the early stages of the warthat he was open to talks with Zelensky.\nHis remarks were believed to be in response to a proposal by the Ukrainian president for the 30-hour Easter truce to be extended for 30 days. No truce has yet been agreed on.\nKyiv has been on the receiving end of growing pressure from Trump to accept territorial concessions as part of an agreement with Moscow to end the war.\nThe issue of the occupied Crimean peninsula, which was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014, has become a particular flashpoint.\nZelensky has repeatedly rejected the idea of recognising Crimea as part of Russia, telling reporters in Kyiv on Friday: \"Our position is unchanged - only the Ukrainian people have the right to decide which territories are Ukrainian.\"\nHowever, in later remarks he suggested \"territorial issues\" could be discussed if a \"full and unconditional ceasefire\" is agreed on.\n\"A full and unconditional ceasefire opens up the possibility to discuss everything,\" he said.\nHe also referenced comments made by Trump inan interview with Time magazine, in which the US president said \"Crimea will stay with Russia\".\n\"What President Trump says is true, and I agree with him in that today we do not have enough weapons to return control over the Crimean peninsula,\" Zelensky said.\nThe US's peace plan has not been publicly released, but reports suggest it proposes Russia keeps the land it has gained, amounting to about 20% of Ukraine's territory - a condition that is in Moscow's favour.\nAccording to the Reuters news agency, which has seen US proposals handed to European officials last week as well as subsequent counter-proposals from Europe and Ukraine, there are significant disparities between them.\nThe US deal offers American legal acceptance of Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and de facto recognition of Russian control of other occupied areas, including all of the Luhansk region.\nBy contrast, the Europeans and Ukrainians will only discuss what happens to occupied Ukrainian territory after a ceasefire has come into effect.\nAs the meeting between Witkoff and Putin was taking place, Trump claimed talks were going in the right direction.\n\"They're meeting with Putin right now, as we speak, and we have a lot of things going on, and I think in the end we're going to end up with a lot of good deals, including tariff deals and trade deals,\" he told reporters in the US.\nHe said his aim was to bring about an end to fighting in Ukraine which was claiming the lives of 5,000 Ukrainian and Russians a week, adding he believed \"we're pretty close\" to a peace deal.\nBut Russia and Ukraine's positions still seem miles apart, with no representative from Ukraine invited to take part in the talks in Moscow.\nWriting on social media on Friday, Zelensky criticised Russia forfailing to agree to a 30-day ceasefire proposed by the US on 11 Marchand urged allies to apply more pressure to it.\n\"It's been 45 days since Ukraine agreed to President Trump's proposal for quiet in the sky, sea and the frontline,\" he said. \"Russia rejects all this. Without pressure this cannot be resolved. Pressure on Russia is necessary.\"\nHe said Russia was being allowed to import missiles from countries such as North Korea, which he said it then used ina deadly missile strike on Kyivon Thursday, which killed 12 people.\n\"Insufficient pressure on North Korea and its allies allows them to make such ballistic missiles. The missile that killed the Kyiv residents contained at least 116 parts imported from other countries, and most of them, unfortunately, were made by US companies,\" Zelensky alleged.\nFollowing the attack on Kyiv, Trump said he was \"putting a lot of pressure\" on both sides to end the war, and directly addressed Putin in a post on social media,saying: \"Vladimir STOP!\"\nSince then, however, Trump has blamed Kyiv for starting the war, telling Time magazine: \"I think what caused the war to start was when they [Ukraine] started talking about joining Nato.\"\nAhead of the talks between Witkoff and Putin on Friday, asenior Russian general was killed in a car bomb attackin the Russian capital. The Kremlin accused Ukraine of being responsible. Kyiv has not commented.\nTwo people were also killed in a Ukrainian strike on the Russian region of Belgorod, the local governor said. Again, Ukraine has not commented on the claim."

    "section": "news",
    "summary": "After a deadly militant attack in Kashmir, India suspended a key water treaty with neighbouring Pakistan.",
    "content": "Will India be able to stop the Indus river and two of its tributaries from flowing into Pakistan?\nThat's the question on many minds, after India suspended a major treaty governing water sharing of six rivers in the Indus basin between the two countries, following Tuesday'shorrific attackin Indian-administered Kashmir.\nThe 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) survived two wars between the nuclear rivals and was seen as an example of trans-boundary water management.\nThe suspension is among several steps India has taken against Pakistan, accusing it of backing cross-border terrorism -  a charge Islamabad flatly denies. It has also hit back with reciprocal measures against Delhi, and said stopping water flow \"will be considered as an Act of War\".\nThe treaty allocated the three eastern rivers – the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej – of the Indus basin to India, while 80% of the three western ones – the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab – to Pakistan.\nDisputes have flared in the past, with Pakistan objecting to some of India's hydropower and water infrastructure projects, arguing they would reduce river flows and violate the treaty. (More than 80% of Pakistan's agriculture and around a third of its hydropower depend on the Indus basin's water.)\nIndia, meanwhile, has been pushing to review and modify the treaty, citing changing needs - from irrigation and drinking water to hydropower - in light of factors like climate change.\nOver the years, Pakistan and India have pursued competing legal avenues under the treaty brokered by the World Bank.\nBut this is the first time either side has announced a suspension - and notably, it's the upstream country, India, giving it a geographic advantage.\nBut what does the suspension really mean? Could India hold back or divert the Indus basin's waters, depriving Pakistan of its lifeline? And is it even capable of doing so?\nExperts say it's nearly impossible for India to hold back tens of billions of cubic metres of water from the western rivers during high-flow periods. It lacks both the massive storage infrastructure and the extensive canals needed to divert such volumes.\n\"The infrastructure India has are mostly run-of-the-river hydropower plants that do not need massive storage,\" said Himanshu Thakkar, a regional water resources expert with the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People.\nSuch hydropower plants use the force of running water to spin turbines and generate electricity, without holding back large volumes of water.\nIndian experts say inadequate infrastructure has kept India from fully utilising even its 20% share of the Jhelum, Chenab and Indus waters under the treaty - a key reason they argue for building storage structures, which Pakistan opposes citing treaty provisions.\nExperts say India can now modify existing infrastructure or build new ones to hold back or divert more water without informing Pakistan.\n\"Unlike in the past, India will now not be required to share its project documents with Pakistan,\" said Mr Thakkar.\nBut challenges like difficult terrain and protests within India itself over some of its projects have meant that construction of water infrastructure in the Indus basin has not moved fast enough.\nAfter a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir in 2016,Indian water resources ministry officials had told the BBCthey would speed up construction of several dams and water storage projects in the Indus basin.\nAlthough there is no official information on the status of such projects, sources say progress has been limited.\nSome experts say that if India begins controlling the flow with its existing and potential infrastructure, Pakistan could feel the impact during the dry season, when water availability is already at its lowest.\n\"A more pressing concern is what happens in the dry season - when the flows across the basin are lower, storage matters more, and timing becomes more critical,\" Hassan F Khan, assistant professor of Urban Environmental Policy and Environmental Studies at Tufts University, wrote in theDawnnewspaper.\n\"That is where the absence of treaty constraints could start to be felt more acutely.\"\nThe treaty requires India to share hydrological data with Pakistan - crucial for flood forecasting and planning for irrigation, hydropower and drinking water.\nPradeep Kumar Saxena, India's former IWT commissioner for over six years, told the Press Trust of India news agency that the country can now stop sharing flood data with Pakistan.\nThe region sees damaging floods during the monsoon season, which begins in June and lasts until September. But Pakistani authorities have said India was already sharing very limited hydrological data.\n\"India was sharing only around 40% of the data even before it made the latest announcement,\" Shiraz Memon, Pakistan's former additional commissioner of the Indus Waters Treaty, told BBC Urdu.\nAnother issue that comes up each time there is water-related tension in the region is if the upstream country can \"weaponise\" water against the downstream country.\nThis is often called a \"water bomb\", where the upstream country can temporarily hold back water and then release it suddenly, without warning, causing massive damage downstream.\nCould India do that?\nExperts say India would first risk flooding its own territory as its dams are far from the Pakistan border. However, it could now flush silt from its reservoirs without prior warning - potentially causing damage downstream in Pakistan.\nHimalayan rivers like the Indus carry high silt levels, which quickly accumulate in dams and barrages. Sudden flushing of this silt can cause significant downstream damage.\nThere's a bigger picture: India is downstream of China in the Brahmaputra basin, and the Indus originates in Tibet.\nIn 2016, after Indiawarnedthat \"blood and water cannot flow together\" following a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir which India blamed on Pakistan, China blocked a tributary of the Yarlung Tsangpo - that becomes the Brahmaputra in northeast India.\nChina, that has Pakistan as its ally, said they had done it as it was needed for a hydropower project they were building near the border. But the timing of the move was seen as Beijing coming in to help Islamabad.\nAfter building several hydropower plants in Tibet, China has green-lit what will be the world's largest dam on the lower reaches of Yarlung Tsangpo.\nBeijing claims minimal environmental impact, but India fears it could give China significant control over the river's flow."

    "content": "A senior Russian general has been killed in a car bomb attack in Moscow, officials have confirmed.\nRussia's Investigative Committee (SK) - the main federal investigating authority in the country - confirmed Gen Yaroslav Moskalik died when a Volkswagen Golf car exploded after an improvised explosive device stuffed with pellets went off.\nLocal media reported the car was parked next to the general's house in the eastern suburb of Balashikha and exploded as he walked past it.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has blamed Ukraine for the attack, saying Kyiv \"continues its involvement in terrorist activities inside our country\". Ukraine has not commented.\nMoskalik represented Russia's General Staff in talks with Ukraine in Paris in 2015, which resulted in theMinsk agreementsset up to end the war between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatist forces that started in 2014.\nAccording to the Kremlin website, he joined the Russian contingent led by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Kremlin aide and former Russian ambassador to the US, Yuri Ushakov, for those ceasefire talks.\nVideos and photos circulating on Telegram on Friday show a car in flames outside a block of flats.\nAs a matter of policy, Ukraine never officially admits or claims responsibility for targeted attacks such as the one which killed Gen Moskalik.\nBut unnamed sources within Ukrainian security services have previously told the media, including the BBC, that they have been behind similar assassinations, such asthe killing of Gen Igor Kirillov in December 2024. Named officials, though, never went on the record.\nWithin Russia, there does not appear to be a force willing and able to carry out such attacks.\nThe incident came before US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff held talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Friday.\nLavrov earlier said Moscow was \"ready to reach a deal\" with the US to end the Ukraine war, although some elements needed to be \"fine-tuned\".\nMeanwhile, in Ukraine, the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, suggested his country may have to give away territory as part of any peace deal.\nDrone attacks on Ukraine continued overnight into Friday.\nUkraine's air force said Russia launched 103 drones, which killed three people, including a child and a 76-year-old woman, in the town of Pavlohrad, in the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region.\nUkraine's north-eastern city of Kharkiv also came under attack with its mayor, Ihor Terekhov, saying several private buildings were damaged."

    "section": "news",
    "summary": "Visitors have noticed a unique atmosphere at the Vatican in the days before Pope Francis's funeral and the conclave.",
    "content": "The seat at the Vatican had been vacant for two days when a group of grey-clad nuns stood on St Peter's Square and started to sing.\nSoftly at first then louder, as if to encourage those who joined in timidly, the nuns broke into Ave Maria.\nEvery so often they shuffled a few inches forward, following the queue for Pope Francis's lying in state. And all the while they sang, their faces turned to St Peter's Basilica to their left, their white veils glistening under their large sun hats.\nIt was a fitting sight for an extraordinary week in which Rome seemed to regain its reputation as the \"capital of the world\" – and St Peter's Square as the centre of the Catholic universe.\nThere is mourning, but also recognition that the Pope, who lived to 88, died quickly and peacefully. \"At least he didn't suffer,\" many say. Yet this isn't the time for celebration either - that will have to wait until after the funeral, when the conclave will spark the usual frenzy of excitement, intrigue and inevitable speculation.\nBefore then, in Rome these in-between days have taken on a flavour of their own.\nElena, a Romanian woman in her 50s, said she had noticed a \"pensive\" atmosphere in the city. \"There are big crowds around but I have felt everything was a bit quieter, there is something different in the air,\" she told the BBC, guessing that the Pope's death was encouraging people to \"look inside\" more.\nShe added that everyone she spoke to this week – even non-believers – had been marked by his death somehow.\nHer friend Lina agreed. She was standing behind the counter of her tobacconist shop in Borgo Pio, a quiet cobblestoned street lined with buildings in earthy tones and flower boxes near the Vatican. \"It's neither a week of tragedy nor one of celebration,\" she said. \"It's a chance for people to think, to reflect, and I think that's much needed.\"\nNearby, people slowly ambled down Via della Conciliazione – the pedestrian street that connects Italy and the Vatican city state, and the same one the Pope's coffin will travel down on Saturday as he reaches his final place of rest in the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore.\nThe 4th Century church is only located around 4km away from St Peter's, but the journey there is set to take around two hours as the car carrying the Pope's coffin will move at walking pace to allow people lining the streets to see it and say their goodbyes, the Vatican said earlier this week.\nTwo plain-clothed police officers acknowledged that the neighbourhood was much busier than usual, but that it \"felt like a Saturday,\" and that people had been very relaxed.\nStill, the signs of the huge security operation mounted by the Vatican and Italian authorities were everywhere.\nOn Wednesday, a soldier stood outside a religious goods shop brandishing a hefty bazooka-like anti-drone device. Asked whether the contraption could, for instance, disrupt drone frequencies and force them to return to their bases, he replied mysteriously: \"Maybe, among other things.\"\nNext to him, a fellow soldier scanned the sky with binoculars. On the day of the funeral, they will be joined by thousands of security personnel from various branches of the police and armed forces, as well as river patrol units, bomb-sniffing dogs and rooftop snipers.\nAmerican student Caislyn, who was sat on a bench sketching the dome of St Peter's, said she was \"shocked\" at how safe she felt despite the number of people around.\nThe 21-year-old attributed that to the fact that \"people are here to pay their respects to Francis, and to enjoy this beautiful city.\" She called the atmosphere \"bittersweet,\" but said she saw the funeral as a \"celebration of life\".\n\"He gave such a great example to the world,\" she reminisced.\nAs Caislyn recalled Francis' commitment to the poorest of society, many others referenced his last-known trip outside the Vatican on Maundy Thursday, when he visited prisoners at the Regina Coeli jail, as he had done many times before.\n\"He was close to the people,\" Elena said fondly, adding that she understood why he \"couldn't stay away\" from helping those worst off.\n\"I work as a volunteer for homeless people and every time I try to stop, something pulls me back. Why? Because I lived like them for three months, because I come from poverty too. It's not hard for me to feel close to them,\" she said.\n\"And I think it was the same for Francis,\" she said, mentioning comments by Francis's sister Maria Elena who told Italian media last month that she and her siblings had grown up in poverty in Argentina.\nElena added: \"He never forgot where he was from. Even when he got to the highest role, he never let it change him.\"\nFor Belgian tourist Dirk, whose wife was queuing to see the Pope lying in state in the basilica, the sombre atmosphere since the Pope's death is something that \"draws people in, it's something they want to be a part of\".\n\"It might just be temporary, it'll probably be over by Monday,\" he laughed.\nDryly, he remarked on the number of homeless – and often disabled – people around the Vatican. \"I saw a woman who was walking almost bent over, and people in clergy clothes completely ignored her, in fact they looked in the other direction so they wouldn't have to be confronted with it,\" he said.\n\"So it remains shocking, the wealth of these churches around us and the poverty of the people sleeping on their doorsteps.\" He shook his head. \"The contrast is jarring to me.\"\nKatleho - an upbeat young woman from Lesotho - told the BBC that she felt \"special, happy\" when she received Pope Francis's Easter blessing on the day before he died, when he appeared on St Peter's balcony. \"I thought: I'm a real Catholic now!,\" she laughed.\nShe said she felt \"so privileged to be joining a multitude of people\" who were paying their respects to Pope Francis this week. \"It's a real shared experience, it's so wonderful,\" she said, skipping off to catch up with the rest of her group.\nFor three days this week, tens of thousands of people streamed into St Peter's to bid their last farewell to the Argentinian Pope who – as he put it when he was elected – had come \"from the end of the world\".\nAs they entered the basilica after hours of queuing,visitors and pilgrims proceeded towards Francis's body, lying in a casket by the high altar built over the tomb of St Peter, the Catholic Church's first pope. Some brandished selfie sticks, others clutched their rosaries or their children's hands. All were very quiet.\nOutside, under the warm April sunshine, groups of joyous African pilgrims in flashy head wraps ate gelato by the Bernini fountain, seagulls circling overhead.\nRetired Californian couples fanned themselves under the square's colonnades, and journalists from around the world shouted questions in shaky Italian at any cardinal who looked like theymay have a vote in the upcoming conclave.\nHolding his phone out to show a caller back home his surroundings, a Brazilian priest spun on himself, laughing."

    "content": "The UN World Food Programme says it has depleted all its food stocks in Gaza, where Israel has blocked deliveries of humanitarian aid for seven weeks.\n\"Today, WFP delivered its last remaining food stocks to hot meals kitchens,\" it warned. \"These kitchens are expected to fully run out of food in the coming days.\"\nIsrael cut off aid on 2 March and resumed its offensive two weeks later after the collapse of a two-month ceasefire, saying it was putting pressure on Hamas to release its remaining hostages.\nThe UN says Israel is obliged under international law to ensure supplies for the 2.1 million Palestinians in Gaza. Israel says it is complying with international law and there is no aid shortage.\nAt the end of March, all 25 bakeries supported by the WFP in Gaza were forced to close after wheat flour and cooking fuel ran out. Food parcels distributed to families containing two weeks' rations were also exhausted.\nMalnutrition is also rapidly worsening, according to the UN. Last week, one of its humanitarian partners screened 1,300 children in northern Gaza and identified more than 80 cases of acute malnutrition - a two-fold increase from previous weeks.\nThe UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says there are also severe shortages of medicine, medical supplies and equipment for hospitals overwhelmed by casualties from the Israeli bombardment, and that fuel shortages are hampering water production and distribution.\nThe WFP said the current Israeli blockade – the longest closure Gaza has ever faced – had exacerbated already fragile markets and food systems.\nFood prices had skyrocketed by up to 1,400% compared to during the ceasefire, and the shortages of essential commodities raised serious nutrition concerns for vulnerable populations, including children under five, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and the elderly, it warned.\n\"The situation inside the Gaza Strip has once again reached a breaking point: people are running out of ways to cope, and the fragile gains made during the short ceasefire have unravelled. Without urgent action to open borders for aid and trade to enter, WFP's critical assistance may be forced to end,\" the agency said.\n\"WFP urges all parties to prioritize the needs of civilians and allow aid to enter Gaza immediately and uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law.\"\nMore than 116,000 tonnes of food assistance - enough to feed one million people for up to four months - is positioned at aid corridors and is ready to be delivered as soon as Israel reopens Gaza's border crossings, according to the agency.\nIn the meantime, WFP Country Director Antoine Renard told the BBC the agency was trying everything it could to keep the hot meals kitchens running.\n\"More than 80% of the population... have been displaced during the war. And just since 18 March [when the Israeli offensive restarted], you've got more than 400,000 people who have been displaced once again,\" he said.\n\"Every time you move, every time you lose assets. So these kitchens are so essential for people to have a basic meal.\"\nHowever, even when fully supplied, the kitchens have been reaching just half the population with only 25% of daily food needs.\nGavin Kelleher, humanitarian access manager with the Norwegian Refugee Council, told the BBC from central Gaza that once the kitchens' food stocks ran out they would no longer able to provide anything.\nTo survive, he said, people were eating less, bartering to \"exchange a bag of diapers for lentils or cooking oil\", or selling what belongings they have left to try to get cash to access remaining food supplies.\nHe added that begging was also taking place on a scale not seen before in Gaza, but that people were not able to give to others anymore.\n\"The desperation is really, really severe.\"\nEarlier this week, the Israeli foreign ministry rejected criticism of the blockade from the UK, France and Germany, which called it \"intolerable\" and demanded it end immediately in a joint statement.\nThe ministry said more than 25,000 lorries carrying almost 450,000 tonnes of aid had entered Gaza during the ceasefire, adding: \"Israel is monitoring the situation on the ground, and there is no shortage of aid in Gaza.\"\nIt also said Israel was not obliged to allow in aid because Hamas had \"hijacked\" supplies \"to rebuild its terror machine\".\nHamas has previously denied stealing aid and the UN has said it has kept \"a very good chain of custody on all the aid it's delivered\".\nLast week, Hamas rejected an Israeli proposal for a new ceasefire, which included a demand to disarm in return for a six-week pause in hostilities and the release of 10 of the 59 hostages still in captivity. The group reiterated it would hand over all of the hostages in exchange for an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal.\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nAt least 51,439 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."

We regret that.\"\nA statement by the municipality on Thursday said the artworks were put into storage during work on a town hall in Uden - which is being incorporated into the neighbouring municipality of Landerd to form the Maashorst municipality.\n\"It's most likely that the artworks were accidentally taken away with the trash,\" they said.\nA report by investigators found that some of the artworks were stored in wheelie bins in the basement and were \"not handled with care\", according to daily newspaper Algemeen Dagblad.\nThe report concluded: \"Ownership was not properly established, no policies and procedures were established regarding the renovation and insufficient action was taken when the artworks turned out to be missing.\"\nIt went on to say that a lack of guidelines for registration, storage, conservation and security of the artworks, were also contributing factors.\nLocal media reports that the 46 artworks altogether were worth around €22,000 (£18,800) and the Maashorst municipality said it was unlikely they will ever be found.\nQueen Beatrix reigned as queen of the Netherlands from 1980 until she abdicated in 2013, when she was succeeded by her son King Willem-Alexander.\nThe Queen Beatrix print was part of Warhol's series Reigning Queens, which comprised of 16 colourful prints of four monarchs, including the late Queen Elizabeth II, Margrethe II of Denmark - who abdicated in 2023 - and Queen Ntombi Twala of Eswatini, previously known as Swaziland.\nWarhol, considered one of the greatest artists of the 20th Century, created the prints in 1985 - two years before his death.\nIn November last year, Warhol prints of Queen Beatrix and Ntombi Twala were stolen - and abandoned - duringa heist on a Dutch art gallery.\nLocal police at the time said thieves took four silkscreen prints from the MPV Gallery in the North Brabant province and fled by car.\nBut the portraits of Queen Beatrix and Queen Ntombi were later abandoned because they did not fit in the vehicle, NOS reported at the time."

    "content": "California's economy has overtaken that of the country of Japan, making the US state the fourth largest global economic force.\nGovernor Gavin Newsom touted new data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the US Bureau of Economic Analysis showing California's growth.\nThe data shows California's gross domestic product (GDP) hit $4.10 trillion (£3.08 trillion) in 2024, surpassing Japan, which was marked at $4.01 trillion. The state now only trails Germany, China and the US as a whole.\n\"California isn't just keeping pace with the world - we're setting the pace,\" Newsom said.\nThe new figures come as Newsom has spoken out against President Donald Trump's tariffs and voiced concern about the future of the state's economy.\nCalifornia has the largest share of manufacturing and agricultural production in the US. It is also home to leading technological innovation, the centre of the world's entertainment industry and the country's two largest seaports.\nNewsom, a prominent Democrat and possible presidential candidate in 2028,filed a lawsuitchallenging Trump's authority to impose the levies, which have caused disruption to global markets and trade.\nTrump has enacted 10% levies on almost all countries importing to the US, after announcing a 90-day pause on higher tariffs.\nAnother 25% tariff was imposed on Mexico and Canada. The levies on China, however, have led to an all-out trade war with the world's second largest economy.\nTrump imposed import taxes of up to 145% on Chinese goods coming into the US and China hit back with a 125% tax on American products.\nHis administration said last week that when the new tariffs were added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.\nNewsom noted his worries about the future of the state's economy.\n\"While we celebrate this success, we recognise that our progress is threatened by the reckless tariff policies of the current federal administration,\" he said. \"California's economy powers the nation, and it must be protected.\"\nTrump has argued his trade war is only levelling the playing field after years of the US being taken advantage of.\nThe tariffs are an effort to encourage factories and jobs to return to the US. It is one major pillar of his economic agenda, as is a cut in interest rates, aimed at reducing the cost of borrowing for Americans.\nThenew datashows California's GDP behind the US at $29.18 trillion, China at $18.74 trillion and Germany at $4.65 trillion. It also shows California was the fastest growing among those countries.\nJapan's economy is under pressure because of its decreasing and ageing population, which means its workforce is shrinking and social care costs are ballooning.\nThis week, the IMF cut its economic growth forecast for Japan and projected that  the central bank would raise interest rates more slowly than previously expected because of the impact of higher tariffs.\n\"The effect of tariffs announced on April 2 and associated uncertainty offset the expected strengthening of private consumption with above-inflation wage growth boosting household disposable income,\" its World Economic Outlook report said."

Earlier this month, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) attacked the nearby Zamzam camp, forcing tens of thousands to flee their makeshift shelters.\nMany Zamzam residents had been there for two decades, after escaping previous conflicts in Darfur.\nThe RSF has been battling the army for the past two years in a war that has killed an estimated 150,000 people and forced some 13 million from their homes.\nAid agencies say it is the world's worst humanitarian crisis.\nHowever, funding problems have led to the UN reducing the food aid it delivers to areas of Sudan hit by famine, it says.\nThe RSF has been accused of targeting non-Arabic residents of Darfur during the fighting.\nOn Thursday, UK Foreign Minister David Lammy said this displayed \"the hallmarks of ethnic cleansing and may amount to crimes against humanity\".\nHe urged both sides to \"give humanitarian actors the security guarantees needed to deliver aid rapidly\".\nAt least 481 people have been killed in North Darfur, around el-Fasher, since 10 April, the UN stated on Friday, warning that the total number was probably even higher.\nThe body's Human Rights Chief, Volker Türk, expressed concern about the situation, saying: \"The systems to assist victims in many areas are on the verge of collapse, medical workers are themselves under threat and even water sources have been deliberately attacked.\"\nHe also expressed concern over \"widespread reports of sexual violence\".\nThe Zamzam camp had been burned \"to the ground\", according to Nathaniel Raymond, head of the Yale School of Public Health's Humanitarian Research Lab.\nMr Raymond described \"systematic destruction through arson of homes\" and \"aid facilities\", adding that people who managed to escape Zamzam were on the road \"dying of starvation\".\nMr Taylor also warned that Tawila was struggling to cope with the influx of people fleeing their homes.\n\"There is very little in the way of food, there is very little in the way of water,\" he said, adding that the small town was currently sheltering around 130,000 to 150,000 people.\nLast week, people fleeing Zamzam told the BBC their homes had been burned down and that they had been shot at. The RSF says it attacked the camp but denies committing any atrocities.\nFighting is also continuing elsewhere in Sudan.\nIn the southern province of West Kordofan 74 people were killed when the RSF attacked the village of al-Za'afah, the Sudan Doctors network said on Friday.\nGo toBBCAfrica.comfor more news from the African continent.\nFollow us on Twitter@BBCAfrica, on Facebook atBBC Africaor on Instagram atbbcafrica"

    "content": "Former Republican congressman George Santos has been sentenced to more than seven years in prison for wire fraud and aggravated identity theft.\nThe 36-year-old pleaded guilty to the federal charges in New York court last August.\nProsecutors had asked for 87 months - over seven years - in prison, while Santos's attorneys had requested he serve two years, the minimum sentence for aggravated identity theft.\nThe sentencing marks the final step in the downfall of the novice New York politician, who was expelled from Congress after the fraud case alleged that he lied about his background and misused campaign funds to finance his lifestyle.\nSantos reportedly apologised for his actions while crying in court on Friday, saying: \"I cannot rewrite the past, but I can control the road ahead.\"\nThe judge overseeing the case appeared unconvinced. \"You got elected with your words, most of which were lies,\" she said.\nSantos will report to prison on 25 July.\nThe federal government alleged Santos laundered campaign funds to pay for his personal expenses, illegally claimed unemployment benefits while he was employed and lied to the Federal Election Commission (FEC).\nProsecutors said he charged more than $44,000 (£32,000) to his campaign over a period of months using credit cards belonging to contributors who were unaware they were being defrauded.\nIn court last year, Santos admitted to theft and applying for unemployment benefits that he was not entitled to receive. He has also acknowledged making false statements and omissions on financial statements submitted to the House Ethics Committee and the FEC.\nThe former lawmaker has been ordered to pay at least $374,000 (£280,000) in restitution.\nHe has been attempting to raise money on Cameo, a platform where people can purchase personalized videos from celebrities.\nSantos's downfall began after the New York Times in 2022 published an investigation revealing the freshman congressman had lied about his CV, including having a university degree and working for Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.\nFrom there, the lies continued to pile up, including allegations that he stole money from a fundraiser for a dying dog and that he lied about his mother surviving the 11 September terrorist attacks. Shortly after, local and federal officials began to investigate.\nHe was eventually charged with 23 federal felony crimes, and in 2023, he became the first member of Congress to be expelled in more than 20 years, only the sixth in history.\nA report from the House ethics panel accused him of misusing campaign funds for personal benefits, including Botox and subscriptions on the OnlyFans website.\nSantos defeated a Democratic incumbent in 2022, flipping the district that encompasses parts of New York's Long Island and Queens, where he grew up.\nSantos, an ardent supporter of President Donald Trump, has said that he would not ask the president for a pardon.\n\"If the president thinks I'm worthy of any level of clemency that is bestowed upon him, he can go ahead and do it, but for me to seek a pardon is to deny accountability and responsibility,\" Santos told the New York Times.\nYet he appeared to contradict himself in an episode of his podcast, when his guest, blogger Perez Hilton asked him if he would request a pardon if he were sentenced to years in prison.\n\"You bet your sweet ass I would,\" he told the TV personality."

    "content": "The funeral of Pope Francis will be simpler than those of previous popes, following instructions he set out himself.\nBut as a head of state and leader of more than a billion Catholics worldwide, it will still be a spectacle of ceremony and tradition.\nHis death has drawn famous figures, politicians, and thousands of followers to Vatican City to pay their respects.\nArchbishops and bishops will start gatheringat 08:30 local time(07:30 BST) in the Constantine Wing, a corridor adjacent to St Peter's Basilica.\nAt the same time, Catholic priests will congregate in St Peter's Square.\nHalf an hour later,at 09:00 local time, patriarchs from the Orthodox church and cardinals will congregate in Saint Sebastian Chapel, inside the basilica, where the remains of Pope John Paul II lie.\nThey will walk in a funeral procession accompanying the Pope's coffin, which has spent the last four days in the centre of St Peter's Basilica.\nThe funeral startsat 10:00when the coffin is laid in the square in front of St Peter's Basilica. The service will be led by the dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re.\nYou can follow the order of service in full here.\n​​Guests and dignitaries will be seated closer to the basilica and coffin, with thousands of other clergy and members of the public in and around St Peter's Square, similar to the funeral for Pope Benedict XVI shown below.\nThe service will end with prayers for Pope Francis and a final commendation - a concluding prayer where the Pope will be formally entrusted to God.\nThis marks the beginning of a nine-day mourning period called Novemdiales with a mass held every day in his memory.\nOfficials expect at least 250,000 members of the public to attend the funeral and there are some 170 heads of state or government on the guestlist.\nPrince William will represent King Charles III, continuing a precedent set in 2005 when the then-Prince of Wales attended Pope John Paul II's funeral on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II.\nOther heads of state and royals includehave confirmed their attendance, including US President Donald Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron, Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia, and Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.\nThere will also be hundreds of members of the clergy, with each group having a specific dress code for the service.\nFor bishops and archbishops, the liturgical clothes for a funeral include thealb, a white tunic held by a traditional cord calledcincture, theamice, a short linen cloth to cover the neck, and a redchasuble, a solemn cape, in honour of the pope. Finally, they don a simple white linen or silk mitre on their heads.\nCardinals wear similar clothes, but they can be distinguished by their more ornate damask pattern mitres, which look cream rather than white.\nPriests wear simpler garments and a long scarf over their tunic called a red stole.\nThe leaders, or patriarchs, of Orthodox churches will wear their own style of mitres, a cape calledsakkosand an ornate cloth calledomophorion, in colours according to their specific traditions.\nAfter the service, Francis's body - dressed in a red chasuble and a damask and golden papal mitre - will be transported from St Peter's to the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome for burial.\nThe route crosses the river Tiber and passes the Colosseum.\nHe will become the first Pope since Leo XIII, who died in 1903, to be buried outside the Vatican.\nTraditionally, the Pope's remains would have been enclosed the day before the funeral in three nested coffins, made of cypress, lead, and oak.\nThe cypress coffin symbolised humility and mortality; the outer oak coffin, a sign of 'dignity and strength' and the lead coffin, welded to preserve the remains and prevent tampering.\nLast year, however, Pope Francis requested that he be buried in a simpler wooden coffin with a zinc interior.\nThis is the coffin that will be seen in the funeral service.\nAccording to Monsignor Diego Ravelli, the Vatican's master of liturgical ceremonies, the request emphasised \"even more that the Roman Pontiff's funeral is that of a shepherd and disciple of Christ and not of a powerful man of this world\".\nPope Francis was a Jesuit - a Catholic religious order of priests known for their dedication to education and missionary work.\nHe was also a devotee of the Virgin Mary and as such, he chose to be buried in Santa Maria Maggiore, which sits outside the Vatican walls in the centre of Rome.\nThe church houses the Salus Populi Romani, a Byzantine icon of the Virgin believed to have been made by St Luke the Evangelist and used by Jesuit orders all over the world.\nIn his will, written in 2022, Pope Francis said: \"Throughout my life, and during my ministry as a priest and bishop, I have always entrusted myself to the Mother of Our Lord, the Blessed Virgin Mary.\"\n\"I wish my final earthly journey to end precisely in this ancient Marian sanctuary, where I would always stop to pray at the beginning and end of every Apostolic Journey, confidently entrusting my intentions to the Immaculate Mother, and giving thanks for her gentle and maternal care,\" he wrote.\nOn his first day as Pope in 2013, Francis left the Vatican to pray in Santa Maria Maggiore.\nSeven popes are buried in the same basilica in ornamented tombs, however, the Argentinian pontiff asked that his tomb would be in the side aisle, between the Pauline Chapel (Chapel of Salus Populi Romani) and the Sforza Chapel, close to a statue known as the Mary Regina Pacis (Mary, Queen of Peace).\n\"Near that Queen of Peace, to whom I have always turned for help and whose embrace I have sought more than a hundred times during my pontificate,\" he explained in his will.\nThe Pope also asked that his tomb would be in the ground, simple and bearing only the inscription \"Franciscus\", the Latin version of his chosen name.\nWe will be broadcasting the funeral here on the BBC News website and app as part of our live coverage and it will also be available to watch on the iPlayer.\nIn the UK, there will be live coverage presented by Reeta Chakrabarti from 0830-1230 BST on BBC One - available to watch on the iPlayerhere.\nThere will also be live coverage on the BBC News channel presented by Maryam Moshiri - available to watch on the iPlayerhere.\nYou can also listen to coverage of the funeral on theBBC World Service."

He was a warm, approachable uncle, and I loved him deeply.\"\nJosé Ignacio vividly remembers the day his uncle was elected pope, a moment that stunned him, especially after he had dismissed all speculation that Jorge could ascend to the papacy.\n\"I had gone to a family friend's house for a meal, and we began watching the conclave. The moment the white smoke rose, I started to tremble. I became incredibly nervous,\" he said.\n\"Then, the protodeacon stepped out and announced, 'Habemus Papam.' I only heard 'Giorgio Mario.' I dropped to my knees in front of the television and started to cry.\"\nThe short journey to share the news with his mother, who lived just 15 blocks away, took much longer than usual. Everywhere he went, locals stopped him to offer their congratulations.\n\"At home, I hugged my mother, and we cried together for a while. Then cousins and friends started to arrive, and the phone was ringing off the hook.\"\nAmid the chaos, with local and international media camped outside their door, the phone rang again around 9pm. A distant voice on the other end simply said, 'Hello.'\n\"Who am I speaking to,\" I asked. \"It's Jorge, boludo,\" came the reply [using the rude slang Argentines use for \"idiot\", often affectionately].\n\"It was Pope Francis, swearing,\" José Ignacio recalled. \"I handed the phone to mum. As they spoke, I watched her tears dry. It was an incredibly moving moment.\"\nHundreds of thousands are expected to gather in St. Peter's Square on Saturday for Pope Francis's funeral, including world leaders, Catholic officials, and mourners from around the globe.\nHowever, José Ignacio said his family had no plans to travel to Rome for the service.\n\"We firmly believe our place is here,\" he explained, encouraging mourners to honour Pope Francis's memory by donating to charity, a gesture he believed would be a more meaningful tribute.\nJosé Ignacio had shared the news of his wife's pregnancy with the Pope during their last conversation, a moment that would remain etched in his memory forever.\n\"The joy and emotion he expressed were deeply meaningful to me,\" he said, adding that Pope Francis left him with a powerful message to live a life of solidarity, austerity, humility and commitment.\nHe also remembered a conversation from his teenage years when his uncle was a cardinal, recalling it as the best advice he ever received on how to make the world a better place.\n\"Change comes from within, through commitment,\" his uncle had told him.\n\"If you're unhappy with the police, become a policeman and change it from within. If you're dissatisfied with politics, get involved in politics. With commitment and conviction, we can create a better world,' he said.\n\"I think this is one of the most profound lessons I've learned from him.\""

    "summary": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has sent condolences four days after the Pope's death.",
    "content": "The office of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has offered its condolences for Pope Francis, four days after his death.\nAn earlier offer of condolences posted on social media by the official state account of Israel had previously been deleted, causing considerable controversy within the country.\nIsrael is also sending a relatively low-level delegation to the late pontiff's funeral on Saturday, with only the country's Vatican ambassador in attendance.\nAll of this has been seen in Israel and elsewhere as a sign of the Israeli government's displeasure with Pope Francis's impassioned remarks on the war in Gaza.\nBelatedly and somewhat impersonally, the Israeli prime minister's office issued a two sentence offer of condolences on Thursday night.\nIt read: \"The State of Israel expresses its deepest condolences to the Catholic Church and the Catholic community worldwide at the passing of Pope Francis. May he rest in peace.\"\nThe tone of the original message tweeted by the verified @Israel account on X on the day of the Pope's death was noticeably warmer.\nIt featured a photo of Pope Francis at the Western Wall in Jerusalem and concluded: \"May his memory be a blessing.\"\nBut it was swiftly withdrawn, without explanation.\nSeveral Israeli media outlets reported on it being deleted, with the Jerusalem Post quoting officials at the foreign ministry saying that it had been posted in \"error\".\nThe Jerusalem Post also quoted Israel's former ambassador to the Vatican, Raphael Schutz, describing the decision to delete the published statement as a mistake.\nIn the face of such criticism, Israeli officials did point out that the country's current ambassador to the Vatican had offered his condolences in person.\nAnd it is the ambassador, Yaron Sideman, who will represent Israel at the funeral of Pope Francis.\nThis is in marked contrast to the heads of state or government who will be attending from most major nations, including US President Donald Trump.\nIt is also very different from the funeral of the last pope to die while still in office - that of John Paul II in 2005. Israel sent the then-president, Moshe Katsav, and the then-foreign minister, Silvan Shalom, to attend the ceremony.\nThe current Israeli President, Isaac Herzog, did publish an eloquent and heartfelt tribute to Pope Francis in the hours after his death, describing him as a man of deep faith and boundless compassion.\nBut there appear to be no plans for him to attend the funeral. No reason has been given, although it may have something to do with the funeral taking place on Shabbat, the Jewish Sabbath.\nBut it seems clear that the Israeli government's resentment of Pope Francis's expressions of solidarity with the Palestinians, especially during the war in Gaza, has soured its response to his death.\nLast November, Pope Francis suggested that the international community should examine whether Israel's military offensive in Gaza should be classed as genocide – an allegation Israel has vehemently denied.\nEarlier this year, he called the humanitarian situation in Gaza \"shameful\".\nIn his very last public address on Easter Sunday - the day before his death - there was mention of Gaza once again. His address spoke of the suffering of both the Palestinians and the Israelis.\nSince his death, more details have emerged of how Pope Francis would be in contact almost daily with the small Christian community sheltering in a church in Gaza City during the war.\nPalestinians have spoken warmly of how much his expressions of empathy had given them hope.\nAs a sign of how highly they respected the Pope, the Palestinian Authority is sending Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa to the funeral.\nAll this has meant that some in Israel, especially among the coalition of religious and nationalist parties that buoy up Netanyahu's coalition, believe that Pope Francis had taken the side of the Palestinians, despite his expressions of sympathy for Israelis and his efforts at bolstering multi-faith dialogue.\nThat sense of a rift between the current Israeli government and the Vatican may well be visible at the Pope's funeral in Rome, where Israel's leaders will be noticeable by their absence."

The King, when he was Prince of Wales, attended the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005 on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II.\nKing Charles and Queen Camilla were among the last high-profile figures meet the Pope at his residence Casa Santa Marta during a royal visit to Italy earlier this month.\nThe King paid tribute to Pope Francis's \"compassion\" and said \"through his care for both people and planet, he profoundly touched the lives of so many\".\nHe said he and the Queen remembered \"with particular affection\" their meetings with the Pope over the years, and \"were greatly moved to have been able to visit him earlier in the month\".\nLula, who shared a personal rapport with the Pope, and first lady Janja Lula da Silva, will attend the funeral.\nBrazil is home to the world's largest Catholic population, with over 100 million Catholics. Following news of Pope Francis's death on Monday, Lula declared seven days of mourning.\n\"Humanity loses today a voice of respect and welcome for others,\" Lula said.\nNoting the meetings he had held with the Pope over the years, Lula said: \"We were able to share our ideals of peace, equality, and justice - ideals that the world has always needed, and will always need.\"\nTrump announced on his Truth Social platform that he and first lady Melania would attend the Pope's funeral, marking the first foreign trip of his second term as US president.\nAfter news of the Pope's death emerged, Trump ordered that all federal and state flags be flown at half-mast in honour of the late pontiff. He called Pope Francis \"a very good man\" who \"loved the world\" and \"he especially loved people that were having a hard time\".\nThe pair clashed in the past. In 2016, Pope Francis criticised Trump's proposal to build a wall on the US-Mexico border, saying a person \"who thinks only about building walls\" and \"not building bridges, is not Christian\".\nTrump hit back, saying: \"For a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful.\"\nAfterTrump met the Pope during a trip to the Vatican in 2017, he said: \"He is something, he's really good. We had a fantastic meeting.\"\nIn February, Pope Francis described Trump's mass deportations as a \"major crisis\".\nMarcos Jr, who will be in attendance on Saturday, described Francis as the \"best Pope in my lifetime\".\n\"A man of profound faith and humility, Pope Francis led not only with wisdom but with a heart open to all, especially the poor and the forgotten,\" he said.\nThe Philippines is one of the world's most Catholic countries, with almost 80% of Filipinos identifying as Roman Catholic.\nPope Francis's last visit to the country in 2015 drew a crowd ofsix million people at an outdoor Mass in the capital city Manila, a record for a papal event.\nIn the running to become the next Pope is Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle, a Cardinal from the Philippines. Cardinal Tagle has been called the \"Asian Francis\" because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants.\nThe Ukrainian president had said he would travel to Vatican City with first lady Olena Zelenska for the funeral.\nBut on Friday, he said he may not be able to attend due to a number of military meetings, following a strike on Kyiv on Thursday.\nHe said the first lady and foreign minister would still attend.\nIn an earlier tribute to Pope Francis, Zelensky said: \"He knew how to give hope, ease suffering through prayer, and foster unity.\"\n\"He prayed for peace in Ukraine and for Ukrainians.\"\nFollowing Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Francis maderepeated calls for peace and an end to the war. The two leaders met several times at the Vatican, most recently last October.\nFollowing that meeting, Pope Francis wrote on X: \"All nations have the right to exist in peace and security. Their territories must not be attacked, and their sovereignty must be respected and guaranteed through peace and dialogue.\"\nEarlier in 2024, Ukrainehad strongly rejecteda call by the pontiff for Kyiv to negotiate an end to the war and have \"the courage to raise the white flag\".\nOther political figures and royals who will attend the Pope's funeral include:"

    "summary": "In 2016, Pope Francis visited Lesbos and flew 12 migrants back to Italy on his plane - Wafaa Eid was one of them.",
    "content": "\"You are not alone.\"\nThat was Pope Francis's message to migrants on the Greek island of Lesbos when he visited in 2016. He also urged them: \"Do not lose hope.\"\nIt was in the midst of Europe's migration crisis, when hundreds of thousands of people fleeing conflict and abuses in countries such as Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Eritrea sought refuge in the European Union.\nWhat the pontiff did later that day took almost everyone by surprise.\nHe offered to take 12 of the most vulnerable with him on his plane back to Italy. They were selected with the help of the Catholic Sant'Egidio community, who are known for their charity work.\nAmong the 12 were Wafaa Eid, her husband and their two young children, who had fled Syria's civil war.\nShe says Pope Francis was \"like an angel\".\nHe let the migrants get on the plane first in order to get out of the extreme heat.\nOnce on board, \"he came straight to us\", says Wafaa. \"He put his hand on the head of my children and said: 'Welcome.' We were happy.\"\nBefore his intervention she had feared her family could be sent to Turkey, following an EU deal to deport people who had arrived irregularly without official documents.\nThe Pope's actions changed everything for her family.\nThe Sant'Egidio team helped them find accommodation and settle in Italy. Now they live in Rome where she works as a cleaner.\n\"My children have a future, they are studying. I work, my husband works, we have a normal life,\" she says.\nThe Vatican said that the Pope had wanted to extend \"a gesture of welcome\" to refugees, rather than make a political statement. But it was widely seen as a rebuke of hardening EU policy.\nThe previous year more than a million migrants had arrived in Europe by sea, according to estimates from the International Organization for Migration (IOM).\nThe IOM said more than 3,770 were reported to have died trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea in 2015 - most crossing from north Africa to Italy, and more than 800 in the Aegean crossing from Turkey to Greece.\nPope Francis argued that the solution lay with solving the problems in their countries of origin, and urged compassion for people fleeing their homes.\nHis stance was not one that everyone agreed with. Italian politician Matteo Salvini said that he had a duty to oppose illegal migration.\nThe current Italian Prime Minister Georgia Meloni came to power calling for a blockade in the Mediterranean to stop migrants. She is yet to make this happen, and maintained a warm relationship with the Pope, but her position demonstrates the strength of feeling on the issue.\nThree years before his visit to Lesbos, Pope Francis had also visited the southern Italian island of Lampedusa, which many migrants have used as a gateway to the EU.\nThere, he said Mass for migrants, condemned the \"global indifference\" to their plight and cast a wreath in the sea in memory of those who had drowned trying to reach Europe.\nHe followed that up with a visit to the Astalli Centre, in the heart of Rome, which is dedicated to caring for new arrivals to Italy. Each day its kitchen serves meals for about 300 refugees and asylum seekers.\nIt's run by Jesuits – the same religious order that Pope Francis belonged to when he was a priest – and offers services such as basic health care and legal aid, as well as help integrating into Italian society.\nHe arrived in a simple Ford hatchback, taking the time to pose for selfies with some of the migrants there.\n\"At a time when the international political situation was very unstable and was characterised by closing [of borders] in many countries, having a Pope who was on the side of migrants was a big help,\" says the centre's president Father Camillo Ripamonti.\nOne of the people the centre supports, Cedric Musau Kasongo, is from the Democratic Republic of Congo and in 2023 the Pope embarked on an African tour which included Cedric's home country.\nHe was invited to the Vatican with other migrants from each state the Pope was due to visit, to give the Catholic leader a better understanding of the situation there.\n\"I felt really seen,\" Cedric tells me.\n\"Sometimes foreign people are invisible. To be in front of the Pope, to greet him, to hold his hand, for me it was a great gesture. I felt even more welcomed, seen, and heard.\n\"The thing that really stayed with me was his smile – when he greeted me, when he held my hand – that is the image I see when I think of the Pope.\""

    "summary": "Nearly 80 students across two high schools fell sick after eating the meals this week.",
    "content": "Indonesia is on an ambitious mission to offer free meals to 80 million school children - but that hasn't exactly gone according to plan.\nNearly 80 students across two high schools in Cianjur, south of the capital Jakarta, fell ill after eating the meals this week. Most of those who ended up in hospital have since been discharged.\nThis is the latest in a series of food poisonings that have been linked to the programme, a signature policy of President Prabowo Subianto.\nAuthorities investigating the case say the suspected cause is negligent food preparation. Samples from the vomit of students have been sent for lab testing, and police say they have questioned people handling the food, from cooks to packers to delivery workers.\nA 16-year-old student told local media that the shredded chicken in the meal had an \"unpleasant odour\". \"I felt dizzy, nauseous and vomited,\" he said.\nAcross the world, programmes offering free meals to students have proved to be effective in improving health, academic performance and attendance.\nBut Indonesia's $28bn (£21bn) version - shaping up to be the most expensive of its kind - has become the target of food safety concerns and heated anti-government protests.\nIn February, when thousands took to the streets to protest at budget cuts, they aimed their ire at the hefty price of Prabowo's free school meals: \"Children eat for free, parents are laid off,\" read one of their protest signs.\nA centrepiece of Prabowo's presidential campaign last year, the free meals programme was pitched as a way to tackle stunting - a condition caused by malnutrition that affects a fifth of children below the age of five in Indonesia.\n\"Through this initiative, our children will grow taller and emerge as champions,\" Prabowo said in 2023.\nSince he took office last October, this programme, along with other populist policies like new houses and free medical check-ups, has earned him political points. His approval ratings stood at 80% after his first 100 days in power.\nIn the first phase, which began in January, free school meals have made their way to 550,000 students in 26 provinces.\nWhile the programme is \"well-intentioned\", Maria Monica Wihardja, a visiting fellow at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, told the BBC there has been \"no evidence\" of \"widespread urgency\" for free school meals.\nAccording to a national survey in 2024, less than 1% of Indonesia's households went at least one day without any meals in the past year.\nSince January, a series of food poisonings have raised apprehension about the free meals.\nMichelle, an elementary school student in East Nusa Tenggara province, was one of several in her school who suffered suspected food poisoning in February. She told BBC Indonesian at the time that the food, which had given her a stomach ache, was \"bland and stale\".\nAfter the incident, some parents started preparing homemade lunches for their children instead, a school official told BBC Indonesian.\nThis week, after the food poisoning in Cianjur, authorities have promised to step up food safety processes.\n\"We must improve quality,\" said Dadan Hindayana, head of the National Nutrition Agency, who had visited the students in hospital.\n\"⁠One obvious thing is the lack of mature and in-depth planning before this program was launched,\" Eliza Mardian, a researcher at the Center of Reform on Economics Indonesia, told the BBC.\n\"The haste ends up sacrificing quality and effectiveness, which actually worsens the public's perception of this programme.\"\nThe cost of the programme has not helped matters.\nIndonesia has set aside more than $10bn this year for the free school meals.\nBy comparison, India spends $1.5bn a year to feed 120 million children in what is the world's largest such programme. Brazil's version costs about the same and serves some 40 million students.\nTo foot the steep bill in Indonesia, Prabowo has urged the country's tycoons to help, and accepted a funding offer from China.\nHe also ordered $19bn in cuts to pay for it, along with other populist schemes - which made it especially controversial.\nSeveral ministries, including education, had their budgets slashed by half. Bureaucrats who were not furloughed alleged they were forced to scrimp by limiting the use of air conditioning, lifts and even printers.\nUniversity students were furious as news spread of cancelled scholarship programmes and disruptions to their classes.\n\"The worst thing is when the stomach is full, but the brain is not filled,\" Muhammad Ramadan, a student protester in Bandung, told BBC Indonesian - referring to Prabowo's school meals plan.\nThere could be more challenges ahead, such as allegations of budget mismanagement, which have begun to emerge after Indonesia's anti-graft bureau flagged a \"real possibility\" of fraud in March.\nPolice launched an investigation this month after a meal provider in south Jakarta accused authorities of embezzlement, saying that she has not been paid since her kitchen started preparing school meals in February.\nPrabowo, who has continued to defend the programme, said this week that his administration will \"handle\" the allegations and  \"safeguard every cent of public money\".\nExperts, however, say the problem runs much deeper.\nLarge-scale social assistance programmes in Indonesia have historically been \"riddled with corruption\", Muhammad Rafi Bakri, a research analyst at Indonesia's audit board, told the BBC.\n\"Given the sheer size of the budget,\" he said, \"this program is a goldmine for corrupt officials.\"\nWith reporting from BBC Indonesian"

    "summary": "The Tesla boss says he will step back from government work - but exactly when and how is unclear.",
    "content": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he will step back from his role with the Trump administration's cost-cutting team known as Doge.\nThose at the White House, including the president, have said it has long been the plan that Musk would soon step away, but the news came as the billionaire's car business saw earnings plunge.\nMusk's announcement left many unanswered questions, including when he will  actually leave the administration and what will happen to Doge, which stands for Department of Government Efficiency.\nWhen asked by the BBC on Wednesday, President Donald Trump reinforced the message that the administration was preparing for Musk's departure.\n\"We have to, at some point, let him go and do that. We expected to be doing it about this time. I'll talk to Elon about it,\" Trump said at the White House.\nThe president also said Tesla will \"be taken care of\" once Musk returns and alleged that Musk was being \"treated very unfairly, I guess, by some of the public\".\n\"He's a great patriot, and [that] should have never happened to him,\" Trump added.\nHowever, under government rules, spending fewer days at Doge could actually prolong Musk's stint in government.\nMusk has been designated a \"special government employee\" (SGE) – a label that allows him to work at a paid or unpaid government job for 130 days each year.\nAccording to a 2007Department of Justice memo, cited in an October 2024guidance documentfrom the Office of Government Ethics, any day on which an SGE performs any work for the government counts as a full day towards that limit.\nMeasured from Trump's inauguration on 20 January, the 130-day limit - assuming Musk, who brags about working weekends, clocks roughly five days a week at Doge - would run out toward the end of May.\nBut scaling back would extend that timeframe. Additionally, the 130-day limit would reset in January 2026.\nMusk has not given details on his intended schedule. He made the announcement on Tuesday, after Tesla reported financial troubles including a 71% drop in profits.\nThe drop came after repeated \"Tesla takedown\" protests across the globe and calls for boycotts against the car manufacturer amid Musk's government role. While organisers have said most protests have been peaceful, some have beendestructive with fires set at Tesla showroomsor at charging stations.\nThe company warned investors that the pain could continue, declining to offer a growth forecast while saying \"changing political sentiment\" could meaningfully hurt demand for the vehicles.\nMusk told investors on an earnings call that the time he allocates to Doge \"will drop significantly\" and that he would be \"allocating far more of my time to Tesla\".\nAfter the comments, Tesla's languishing stock price rose.\nIt's also unclear how many days Musk has already worked for the government, whether the government is keeping a tally, and how the limit would be enforced.\nThere has been criticism that the Trump administration may have flouted government rules in creating Musk's unprecedented role, and concerns that he may not follow the time limit.\nUnder rules for SGEs, Musk would have to undergo ethics training, provide a confidential financial disclosure statement, and avoid conflicts of interest.\nHis corporate empire includes large companies that do business with the US government and foreign governments, including SpaceX, which has $22 billion in US government contracts, according to the company's chief executive.\nThe rules also prohibit special government employees from partisan activities, including wearing clothing with political slogans, while in government offices or carrying out official duties. Musk has been pictured wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat in the Oval Office.\nStill, in February, an anonymous White House officialtold CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that Musk would file a confidential financial disclosure at some point, and had been given an ethics briefing.\nThe following month, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the BBC: \"Elon Musk is selflessly serving President Trump's administration as a special government employee, and he has abided by all applicable federal laws.\"\nFor now, Musk appears to serve at Trump's behest, with no clear oversight other than the president himself.\nIn a report released last week, progressive think-tank Public Citizen criticised the Trump administration and said the White House was \"wildly abusing\" the SGE rules.\n\"Right now, the public has no way to know whether SGEs like Musk who don't file public financial disclosure reports or are permitted to oversee themselves are putting the people's interests ahead of their own,\" said report author Jon Golinger.\nThe BBC has contacted Musk and the Office of Personnel Management - the agency overseeing special government employees, and one where Doge employees have reportedly taken over several functions - for comment.\nOn Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that around 100 Doge employees would remain in various government departments after Musk departs this year.\nMusk and Trump set a deadline for Doge to finish its work, which corresponds to the 250th anniversary of the signing of the US Declaration of Independence.\nThe executive order setting up Doge, signed by Trump on Inauguration Day in January, mentioned 4 July 2026 as the ending date.\nEarlier, in December, Musk responded to a tweet that also said Doge would finish entirely on that date.\n\"The final step of DOGE is to delete itself,\" he wrote."

    "summary": "Humanoid robots are attracting a lot of investment but will China dominate the industry?",
    "content": "It's a bright spring morning in Hanover, Germany, and I'm on my way to meet a robot.\nI have been invited to see the G1, a humanoid robot built by Chinese firm, Unitree, at the Hannover Messe, one of the world's largest industrial trade shows.\nStanding at about 4'3\" (130cm), G1 is smaller and more affordable than other humanoid robots on the market, and has such a highly fluid range of motion and dexterity that videos of it performing dance numbers andmartial arts have gone viral.\nToday the G1 is being controlled remotely by Pedro Zheng, the Unitree sales manager.\nHe explains that customers must program each G1 for autonomous functions.\nPassers-by stop and actively try to engage with the G1, which cannot be said for a lot of the other machines being shown off in the cavernous conference room.\nThey reach out to shake its hand, make sudden movements to see if it will respond, they laugh when G1 waves or bends backwards, they apologise if they bump into it. There's something about its human shape that, uncanny as it is, sets people at ease.\nUnitree is just one of dozens of companies around the world developing robots that have a human form.\nThe potential is huge - for business it promises a workforce that doesn't need holidays or pay rises.\nIt could also be the ultimate domestic appliance. After all, who wouldn't want a machine that could do the laundry and stack the dishwasher.\nBut the technology is still some way off. While robotic arms and mobile robots have been common in factories and warehouses for decades, conditions in those workplaces can be controlled and workers can be kept safe.\nIntroducing a humanoid robot to a less predictable environment, like a restaurant or a home, is a much more difficult problem.\nTo be useful humanoid robots would have to be strong, but that also makes them potentially dangerous - simply falling over at the wrong time could be hazardous.\nSo much work needs to be done on the artificial intelligence that would control such a machine.\n\"The AI simply has not yet reached a breakthrough moment,\" a Unitree spokesperson tells the BBC.\n\"Today's robot AI finds basic logic and reasoning – such as for understanding and completing complex tasks in a logical way – a challenge,\" they said.\nAt the moment their G1 is marketed at research institutions and tech companies, who can use Unitree's open source software for development.\nFor now entrepreneurs are focussing their efforts on humanoid robots for warehouses and factories.\nThe highest profile of those is Elon Musk. His car company, Tesla, is developing a humanoid robot called Optimus.In January he saidthat \"several thousand\" will be built this year and he expects them to be doing \"useful things\" in Tesla factories.\nOther carmakers are following a similar path. BMWrecently introduced humanoid robotsto a US factory. Meanwhile, South Korean car firm Hyundaihas ordered tens of thousandsof robots from Boston Dynamics, the robot firm it bought in 2021.\nThomas Andersson, founder of research firm STIQ, tracks 49 companies developing humanoid robots - those with two arms and legs. If you broaden the definition to robots with two arms, but propel themselves on wheels, then he looks at more than 100 firms.\nMr Andersson thinks that Chinese companies are likely to dominate the market.\n\"The supply chain and the entire ecosystem for robotics is huge in China, and it's really easy to iterate developments and do R&D [research and development],\" he says.\nUnitree underlines that advantage - its G1 is cheap (for a robot) with an advertised price of $16,000 (£12,500).\nAlso, Mr Andersson points out, the investment favours Asian nations.\nIn a recent report STIQ notesthat almost 60% of all funding for humanoid robots has been raised in Asia, with the US attracting most of the rest.\nChinese companies have the added benefit of support from the national and local government.\nFor example, in Shanghai there isa state-backed training facilityfor robots, where dozens of humanoid robots are learning to complete tasks.\nSo how can US and European robot makers compete with that?\nBristol-based Bren Pierce has founded three robotics companies and the latest, Kinisi has just launched the KR1 robot.\nWhile the robot has been designed and developed in the UK, it will be manufactured in Asia.\n\"The problem you get as a European or American company, you have to buy all these sub-components from China in the first place.\n\"So then it becomes stupid to buy your motors, buy your batteries, buy your resistors, shift them all halfway around the world to put together when you could just put them all together at the source, which is in Asia.\"\nAs well as making his robots in Asia, Mr Pierce is keeping costs down by not going for the full humanoid form.\nDesigned for warehouses and factories, the KR1 does not have legs.\n\"All of these places have flat floors. Why would you want the added expense of a very complex form factor... when you could just put it on a mobile base?\" he asks.\nWhere possible, his KR1 is built with mass-produced components - the wheels are the same as you would find on an electric scooter.\n\"My philosophy is buy as many things as you can off the shelf. So all our motors, batteries, computers, cameras, they're all commercially available, mass produced parts,\" he says.\nLike his competitors at Unitree, Mr Pierce says that the real \"secret sauce\" is the software that allows the robot to work with humans.\n\"A lot of companies come out with very high-tech robots, but then you start needing a PhD in robotics to be able to actually install it and use it.\n\"What we're trying to design is a very simple to use robot where your average warehouse or factory worker can actually learn how to use it in a couple of hours,\" Mr Pierce says.\nHe says the KR1 can perform a task after being guided through it by a human 20 or 30 times.\nThe KR1 will be given to pilot customers to test this year.\nSo will robots ever break out of factories into the home? Even the optimistic Mr Pierce says it's a long way off.\n\"My long term dream for the last 20 years has been building the everything robot. This is what I was doing my PhD work in I do think that is the end goal, but it's a very complicated task,\" says Mr Pierce.\n\"I still think eventually they will be there, but I think that's at least 10 to 15 years away.\""

    "content": "The Netherlands, March 2025. Yungblud is leaving his hotel in Amsterdam when he's approached by a fan in floods of tears.\n\"You saved my life,\"she sobs.\n\"No, you saved your own life,\" he replies, quietly. \"Maybe the music was the soundtrack, but you saved your own life, OK?\"\nLeaning in for a hug, he adds, \"Don't be sad, be happy. I love ya.\"\nIt's a remarkably touching moment, full of compassion and devoid of rock star ego.\nTwo weeks later, after a video of the encounter goes viral, Yungblud is still moved by the memory.\n\"I didn't think people would see that, except me and her,\" he says, \"but it was such a moment for me.\"\nThe interaction crystallised something he'd felt for a while.\n\"I always said that Bowie and My Chemical Romance saved my life, but ultimately you have to find yourself,\" he says.\n\"Like this morning, I put my headphones on and I listened to [The Verve's] Lucky Man, and it made me go, 'Oh, I'm ready to face the day'.\n\"But Richard Ashcroft didn't tell me I was ready to face the day. I said that to myself.\n\"That's what I was trying to tell that girl in Amsterdam.\"\nSelf-assurance is a lesson he learned the hard way.\nOn the surface, Yungblud, aka 27-year-old Dominic Harrison, had it all. Two number one albums, an international fanbase,a Louis Theroux documentaryand enough clout to run his own festival.\nBut if you looked more closely, there were chinks in the armour. Those number one albums both fell out of the Top 30 after one week, a sign of a strong core fanbase, with limited crossover appeal.\nAnd the first year of his Bludfest in Milton Keynes was criticised afterlong queues and a lack of watercaused fans to pass out and miss the concert.\nHarrison was keenly aware of it all. As he released his self-titled third album in 2022, he hit a low.\n\"Yungblud was number one in seven countries, and I wasn't happy because it wasn't the album I wanted to make,\" he says.\n\"It was a good album, but it wasn't exceptional.\"\nThe problem, he says, was a record label who'd pushed him in a more commercial direction. But in polishing his sound, he lost the angry unpredictability that characterised his best work.\n\"It's funny, my-self titled album was actually the one where I was most lost,\" he observes.\n\"I felt like I compromised but, because of that, I was never taking no for an answer again.\"\nNowhere is that clearer than on his comeback single,Hello Heaven, Hello.\nOver nine minutes and six seconds it achieves Caligulan levels of excess, full of scorching guitar solos, throat-shredding vocal runs, and even an orchestral coda.\n\"Do you still remember, or have you forgotten where you're from?\" Harrison asks himself, as he re-ignites his ambition.\nThe song's purposefully unsuited to radio – unlike the follow-up single, Lovesick Lullaby. Released today, it's a free-associating rampage through a messy night out, that ends with epiphany in a drug dealer's apartment.\nCombining Liam Gallagher's sneer with Beach Boys' harmonies, it's uniquely Yungblud. But the singer reveals it was originally written for his last album.\n\"We were actually discouraged from doing it,\" he says.\n\"My advisor at the time, a guy called Nick Groff [vice president of A&R at Interscope, responsible for signing Billie Eilish], was like, 'I don't get it'.\"\nWarming to the theme, he continues: \"The music industry is crap because it's all about money but, as an artist, I need to make sure that anything I put out is exciting and unlimited.\n\"It can't be like a 50% version of me.\"\nTo achieve that, he shunned expensive recording studios and made his new album in a converted Tetley brewery in Leeds.\nProfessional songwriters were banished, too, in favour of a close group of collaborators, including guitarist Adam Warrington, and Matt Schwartz, the Israeli-British producer who helmed his 2018 debut.\n\"When you make an album in LA or London, everything is great, even if it's mediocre, because people want a hit out of it,\" he argues.\n\"When you make an album with family, all they want is the truth.\"\nOne of the most honest tracks on the record is Zombie, a lighters-aloft ballad (think Coldplay, sung by Bruce Springsteen) about \"feeling you're ugly, and learning to battle that\".\n\"I always was insecure about my body, and that got highlighted as I got famous,\" says the singer, who last year revealed he'ddeveloped an eating disorderdue to body dysmorphia.\n\"But I realised, the biggest power you can give someone over you is in how you react. So I decided, I'm going to get sober, I'm going to get fit, and I discovered boxing.\"\nHe ended up working with the South African boxer Chris Heerden - who was recently in the news afterRussia jailed his ballerina girlfriend, Ksenia Karelina.\n\"I met him before all that,\" says Harrison, \"but he's been extremely inspirational. Boxing's become like therapy for me.\n\"If someone says something bad about me, I go to the gym, hit the punch bag for an hour and talk it out.\"\nFans have noticed the change… drooling over photos of his newly chiseled torso, and declaring 2025 his \"shirt-off era\".\n\"Maybe the shirt-off era is a comeback to all the comments I've had,\" he laughs.\n\"I'm claiming a freedom and a sexiness and a liberation.\"\nHe's clearly found a degree of serenity, without surrendering the restless energy that propelled him to fame.\nPart of that is down to control. In January,he created a new companythat brings together his core business of recorded music with touring operations, his fashion brand and his music festival, Bludfest.\nThe event kicked off in Milton Keynes last summer but suffered teething troubles, when fans were stuck in long queues.\n\"I will fully take responsibility for that,\" says the star, who claims he was \"backstage screaming\" at police and promoters to get the lines moving.\n\"The problem was, there were six gates open when there should have been 12,\" he says, suggesting people underestimated his fans' dedication.\n\"When Chase and Status had played [there] a day before, there were 5,000 people when the doors opened, and another 30,000 trickled in during the day.\n\"With my fans, there were 20,000 kids at the gate at 10am. So we've learned a lot for this year. There'll be pallets of water outside. It'll be very different.\"\nDedication to his fans is what makes Yungblud Yungblud.\nHe built the community directly from his phone and, whether intended or not, that connection has sustained his career - insulating him from the tyrannies of radio playlists and streaming placement.\nMaintaining a personal relationship becomes harder as his fanbase grows but, ever astute, he hired a fan to oversee his social accounts.\n\"She's called Jules Budd. She used to come to my gigs in Austin and she'd sell confetti to pay for gas money to the next city.\n\"She built an account called Yungblud Army, and she's amazing at letting me understand what are people feeling.\n\"If people are outside and security aren't treating them right, I know about it because she's in contact with them. So I brought her in to make the community safer as it gets bigger.\"\nWith his new album, he wants to make that community even bigger. Harking back to the sounds of Queen and David Bowie, he says it'll \"reclaim the good chords\" (Asus4 and Em7, in case you're wondering).\n\"The shackles are off,\" he grins.\n\"We made an album to showcase our ambition and the way we want to play.\n\"Can you imagine seeing Yungblud in a stadium? 100% yes. Let's do it.\""

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8y4j91l83o",
    "section": "news",
    "summary": "The mineral, once widely-used, releases toxic fibres into the air when disturbed that can cling to the lungs and cause cancer.",
    "content": "Israel's destructive military campaign in Gaza has released a silent killer: asbestos.\nThe mineral, once widely-used in building materials, releases toxic fibres into the air when disturbed that can cling to the lungs and - over decades - cause cancer.\nNowadays, its use is banned across much of the world, but it is still present in many older buildings.\nIn Gaza, it is found primarily in asbestos roofing used across the territory's eight urban refugee camps - which were set up for Palestinians who fled or were driven from their homes during the 1948-49 Arab-Israeli war - according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).\nIn October 2024, UNEP estimated that up to 2.3 million tons of rubble across Gaza could be contaminated with asbestos.\n\"The Gaza rubble is a very, very toxic environment,\" says Professor Bill Cookson, director of the National Centre for Mesothelioma Research in London. \"People are going to suffer acutely, but also in the longer term as well, things that children may carry throughout their lives.\"\n\"The lives lost now are not going to end here. The legacy is going to continue,\" says Liz Darlison, CEO of Mesothelioma UK.\nWhen asbestos is disturbed by something like an air strike, its fibres - too small to see with the human eye - can be breathed in by those nearby and can then work their way through to the lining of the lungs.\nOver many years - usually decades - they can cause scarring which leads to a serious lung condition known as asbestosis, or, in some cases, an aggressive form of lung-cancer named mesothelioma.\n\"Mesothelioma is a terrible, intractable illness,\" says Prof Cookson.\n\"The really worrying thing,\" he adds, \"is that it's not dose related. So even small inhalations of asbestos fibre can cause subsequent mesothelioma.\n\"It grows within the pleural cavity. It's extremely painful. It's always diagnosed late. And it's pretty well resistant to all treatments.\"\nTypically, those who contract mesothelioma do so 20 to 60 years after exposure - meaning it will take decades before the possible impact across the territory is felt. A higher level, or longer period, of exposure is believed to accelerate the progression of the disease.\nDr Ryan Hoy, whose research into dust inhalation was cited by the UNEP, says it is extremely difficult to avoid breathing in asbestos fibres because they are \"really tiny particles that float in the air that can get very, very deep into the lungs.\"\nThey are even harder to avoid, he says, because Gaza is so \"densely populated\". The territory houses approximately 2.1 million people and is 365 sq km (141 sq miles) - about one quarter of the size of London.\nExperts on the ground there say people are unable to manage the risks posed by asbestos or dust inhalation due to the more immediate dangers of Israel's military offensive.\n\"At this point in time, [dust inhalation] is not something that is perceived as a worrying thing by the population. They even don't have things to eat, and they're more afraid to be killed by the bombs,\" says Chiara Lodi, medical co-ordinator in Gaza for the NGO Médecins Sans Frontières.\n\"The lack of awareness about the risks of asbestos, combined with the ongoing challenges [people in Gaza] face in trying to rebuild their lives, means they are unable to take the necessary measures to protect themselves,\" a Gaza-based spokesperson for the NGO SOS Children's Villages said.\nMany are \"not fully aware of the harmful effects of the dust and debris\", they added.\nAfter a previous conflict in Gaza in 2009, a UN survey of the territory found asbestos in debris from older buildings, sheds, temporary building extensions, roofs and the walls of livestock enclosures.\nThere are several types of asbestos ranging from so-called \"white asbestos\", which is the least dangerous, to \"blue\", or crocidolite, which is the most. Highly-carcinogenic crocidolite asbestos was previously found in Gaza by the UN.\nGlobally, around 68 countries have banned the use of asbestos, though some maintain exemptions for special use. It was banned in the UK in 1999, and Israel banned its use in buildings in 2011.\nAs well as mesothelioma, asbestos can cause other forms of lung cancer, larynx and ovarian cancer.\nA further, lesser known risk is that of silicosis, a lung disease caused by breathing in silica dust, usually over many years. Concrete generally contains 20-60% silica.\nDr Hoy says the sheer amount of dust in Gaza could lead to an \"increased risk of respiratory tract infections, upper and lower airway infections, pneumonia, exacerbations of pre-existing lung disease like asthma,\" as well as, \"emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which can be worsened by acute exposure to dust\".\nFor years, the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York have been used as a case-study by health experts to examine the effects of a large toxic dust-cloud on a civilian population.\n\"The Twin Towers were not in the middle of a war zone,\" says Ms Darlison, \"so it was something we were able to measure and quantify easier\".\nAs of December 2023, 5,249 of those who were registered with the US government's World Trade Center Health Programme have died as a result of aerodigestive illness or cancer - a far higher figure than the 2,296 people who were killed in the attack itself. A total of 34,113 people were diagnosed with cancer over the same period.\nTheUSand a group ofArab Stateshave proposed competing plans for the reconstruction of Gaza. The UN has warned that the process will have to be managed carefully to avoid disturbing the vast amounts of asbestos-contaminated rubble.\n\"Unfortunately,\" says Ms Darlison, \"the very properties that made us use so much of it are the properties that make it difficult to get rid of.\"\nA UNEP spokesperson told the BBC that the debris removals process will \"increase the likelihood of asbestos disturbance and the release of hazardous fibres into the air\".\nA UNEP assessment indicated that clearing all debris could take 21 years and cost up to $1.2 billion (£929m).\nThe Israeli military launched its offensive on Gaza in response to Hamas's attack on Israel in October 2023 that killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 251 people taken hostage.\nIsrael's offensive has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not respond to the BBC's request for comment."

    "content": "Donald Trump has signed a controversial executive order aimed at stepping up deep-sea mining within US and in international waters.\nThe move to allow exploration outside its national waters has been met by condemnation from China which said it \"violates\" international law.\nThursday's order is the latest issued by the US president to try to increase America's access to minerals used by the aerospace, green technology and healthcare sectors.\nThe deep sea contains billions of tonnes of potato-shaped rocks, called polymetallic nodules, which are rich in critical minerals like cobalt and rare earths.\nThe latest US executive orderwas issued to \"establish the United States as a global leader in responsible seabed mineral exploration\", it reads.\nThe move appears to bypass a long-running round of UN negotiations on mining in international waters.\nMany countries, including China, have delayed issuing permits until countries agreed a framework for how resources could be shared.\n\"The US authorisation... violates international law and harms the overall interests of the international community,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said on Friday.\nChina dominates global production of rare earths and critical metals like cobalt and lithium.\nTrump has beenfrustrated by this relative weakness of the US position, analysts say.\n\"We want the US to get ahead of China in this resource space under the ocean, on the ocean bottom,\" a US official said on Thursday.\nTo achieve this, the order says the US will speed up the process of issuing exploration licences and recovery permits both in its own waters and in \"areas beyond national jurisdiction\".\nThe administration estimates that deep-sea mining could boost the country's GDP by $300bn (£225bn) over 10 years and create 100,000 jobs\nThe EU, the UK and others support a moratorium on the practice until further scientific research is carried out.\nEnvironmentalists and scientists are concerned that marine species living in the deep sea could be harmed by the process.\n\"Deep-sea mining is a deeply dangerous endeavour for our ocean,\" said Jeff Watters of Ocean Conservancy, a US-based environmental group.\n\"The harm caused by deep-sea mining isn't restricted to the ocean floor: it will impact the entire water column, top to bottom, and everyone and everything relying on it,\" he added in a statement released on Friday.\nIt is not clear how quickly deep-sea mining could begin but one mining company, The Metals Company (TMC), is already in discussions with the US government to obtain permits.\nTMC's CEO Gerard Barron has previously said he hopes to begin mining by the end of the year.\nAlong with others in the mining industry, he disputes the environmental claims made and has argued that the abyssal zone - 3,000m to 6,000m below sea level - has very low concentrations of life.\n\"Here there's zero flora. And if we measure the amount of fauna [animal life], in the form of biomass, there is around 10g per square metre. That compares with more than 30kg of biomass where the world is pushing more nickel extraction, which is our equatorial rainforests,\" he previously told the BBC.\nA recent paper published by the Natural History Museum and the National Oceanography Centre looked at the long term impacts of deep sea mining from a test carried out in the 1970s.\nIt concludedthat some sediment-dwelling creatures were able to recolonise the site and recover from the test, but larger animals appeared not to have returned.\nThe scientists concluded this could have been because there were no more nodules for them to live on. The polymetallic nodules where the minerals are found take millions of years to form and therefore cannot easily be replaced."

    "summary": "Following the crackdown, some traders have resorted to selling their goods in secret, the BBC hears.",
    "content": "Traders are counting their losses as Tanzania clamps down on people trying to flout a ban on goods from neighbouring Malawi in an escalating regional trade row.\nOn Friday, businesswomen told the BBC that some fellow traders had been arrested on the second day of a ban imposed by Tanzania on all agricultural imports from Malawi and South Africa.\n\"My bananas were seized and destroyed. Right now, our business has brought losses, and we only have a little money left,\" said Jestina Chanya, a trader in Karongo, about 50km (30 miles) from the border with Tanzania.\nDiplomatic efforts to address the dispute have failed but Tanzania's agriculture minister said fresh talks were ongoing.\nLast month, Malawi blocked imports of flour, rice, ginger, bananas and maize from Tanzania, and other countries, saying this was to protect local producers.\nSouth Africa has for years prohibited the entry of bananas from Tanzania.\nOn Thursday, Tanzania's Agriculture Minister Hussein Bashe said trade restrictions from those two countries \"directly affected\" traders from his country and described the trade barrier as \"unfair and harmful\".\nBashe announced an immediate ban on all agricultural imports from the two countries, \"to protect our business interests\".\nTrade flows have been greatly affected at Kasumulu – the official border crossing between Tanzania and Malawi.\nWhen the BBC visited the Malawian town of Karonga, traders - mostly women - said they were still shaken by the sight of tonnes of their produce slowly rotting, then ultimately being dumped after being denied entry into Tanzania.\n\"The losses I have incurred are big because I can't go buy anything any more, and I don't even know how I will feed my children,\" said June Mwamwaja.\nBut Tanzanian traders have also been hit.\nOn Saturday Tanzania's agriculture ministerposted a video on social media showing a pile of rotten bananasin a truck which had been prevented from entering Malawi.\nTonnes of tomatoes also spoiled at the border recently after lorries from Tanzania were denied entry into Malawi.\nMalawian traders like Jeniffa Mshani said they preferred agricultural goods from Tanzania because it was easier and more affordable to source them across the border.\n\"Tanzanian products are big and sell very well in the market, and their prices are good. Our local [Malawi] products are more expensive. I have nothing to do - I don't have the capacity to compete with those [who have big capital]. I just can't,\" she told the BBC.\nThey said Tanzanian produce, especially potatoes, were larger and of better quality.\nOthers said their customers preferred Tanzanian plantains over Malawian ones, describing the former as tastier, while the latter were often spongy.\nBut since Thursday, Malawian authorities, both at the border and in nearby markets, have become increasingly strict – often arresting traders found with Tanzanian produce.\n\"When we bring goods from Tanzania, they turn us back. One of us was stopped and arrested right at the border,\" another trader said.\nSome of them said they had no idea why they were being blocked while some rich business people were still allowed to transport goods across the border.\n\"They are targeting us who have little capital, while those with big money are still bringing in goods,\" said Ms Chanya, who sells potatoes and bananas in Karonga market.\nFollowing the crackdown, some traders have resorted to selling their goods in secret, afraid to display them openly for fear of arrest.\n\"We only carry three or four bunches [of bananas], just to earn a living for the children,\" said Evelina Mwakijungu, adding: \"But our large consignments have been blocked, so we have no business - we're struggling with our families\".\nThe normally bustling border crossing of Kasumulu remained noticeably quieter than usual with  drivers seen relaxing in the shade of trees, while others played draughts or lounged in the back of their lorries.\nThey declined to be quoted directly but explained that they were simply waiting for word from their bosses on what to do next.\nOn a normal day, more than 15 lorries loaded with agricultural produce would cross the border, drivers told the BBC.\nMalawi's trade ministry spokesperson Patrick Botha told local media that they were yet to get official communication on the issue.\n\"We are hearing [about] this from social media. At an appropriate time, we will comment,\" he was quoted as saying.\nMalawi has become an increasingly important market for Tanzanian goods in recent years, with exports trebling between 2018 and 2023, according to official Tanzanian figures.\nBut landlocked Malawi, which has relied on Tanzanian ports to carry its exports such as tobacco, sugar and soybeans to the rest of the world, will have to reroute its goods.\nIt is not yet clear how hard South Africa, which exports various fruits, including apples and grapes, to Tanzania, will be hit by the ban. South African authorities are yet to comment.\nThe row comes at a time when Africa is supposed to be moving towards greater free trade through the establishment of a continent-wide free-trade area, which began operating four years ago.\nAdditional reporting by Wycliffe Muia\nGo toBBCAfrica.comfor more news from the African continent.\nFollow us on Twitter@BBCAfrica, on Facebook atBBC Africaor on Instagram atbbcafrica"

He pleaded not guilty to the charges and was released on bail.\n\"Nsabumukunzi repeatedly lied to conceal his involvement in the horrific Rwandan genocide while seeking to become a lawful permanent resident and citizen of the United States,\" said John Durham, a federal prosecutor.\nIn just 100 days in 1994, about 800,000 people were killed in Rwanda by ethnic Hutu extremists.\nThe mainly Tutsi forces who took power following the genocide were alleged to have killed thousands of Hutu people in Rwanda in retaliation.\nNsabumukunzi is alleged to have set up roadblocks during the genocide to detain and kill Tutsis and to have participated in killings, prosecutors said, citing witnesses.\n\"Nsabumukunzi used his leadership position to oversee the violence and killings of Tutsis in his local area and directed groups of armed Hutus to kill Tutsis,\" the federal prosecutors said.\nHe was subsequently convicted and sentenced to life in prison in absentia by a Rwandan genocide court, according to US legal papers.\nThe suspect was arrested on Thursday at his home in Bridgehampton, New York, where he had settled as a gardener and beekeeper in an exclusive enclave on Long Island, according to the US media.\nProsecutors said he had lied to US officials in his immigration application, including by falsely denying any involvement as a perpetrator of the Rwandan genocide when he sought refugee status in 2003.\nHe allegedly repeated those lies in his subsequent applications for a green card and naturalisation.\n\"For over two decades, he got away with those lies and lived in the United States with an undeserved clean slate,\" said prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York.\nHe pleaded not guilty and was released on a bond of $250,000 (£188,000).\nThe bail package requires home detention and GPS monitoring, but he will be allowed to continue working as a gardener.\nNsabumukunzi faces a maximum of 30 years in prison, if convicted.\nIn Rwanda, Nsabumukunzi oversaw 150 beekeepers and 1,500 hives, according to the New York Times which profiled him in 2006.\nIn the US, he oversaw about 100 hives for the Hamptons Honey Company, which had hired him to scale up its production, the report said.\nGabriel Alfaya, the owner of Hamptons Honey since 2009, said he was unaware that Nsabumukunzi had worked for the company and had never met him, the New York Times reported.\nNsabumukunzi's lawyer, Evan Sugar, described his client as \"a law-abiding beekeeper and gardener\", in an interview with the AP news agency.\nThe lawyer said Nsabumukunzi was \"a victim of the Rwandan genocide who lost scores of family members and friends to the violence\".\nHe said his client was rightfully granted refugee status and lawful permanent residence and planned to \"fight these 30-year-old allegations\" while maintaining his innocence.\nSeveral people who fled Rwanda to other countries have been arrested on charges related to the killings, as the East African country continues to pursue more genocide suspects from their safe havens abroad.\nGo toBBCAfrica.comfor more news from the African continent.\nFollow us on Twitter@BBCAfrica, on Facebook atBBC Africaor on Instagram atbbcafrica"

    "content": "The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has told the BBC that Ukraine may have to give up land as part of a peace deal with Russia, amid a growing pressure from President Donald Trump to accept territorial concessions.\n\"One of the scenarios is… to give up territory. It's not fair. But for the peace, temporary peace, maybe it can be a solution, temporary,\" he said in response to questions from the BBC.\nBut the 53-year-old former boxing champion-turned politician stressed that the Ukrainian people would \"never accept occupation\" by Russia.\nHe was speaking hours after a Russian missile-and-drone attack on Kyiv killed 12 people and injured more than 80.\nIt was one of the deadliest Russian assaults on the Ukrainian capital in months.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.\nKlitschko is now one of the most senior Ukrainian politicians to indicate publicly that his country may have to give up territory, albeit temporarily.\nThe Kyiv mayor and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are political opponents. The mayor has repeatedly accused the president and his team of trying to undermine his authority.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme from his office in central Kyiv on Thursday, Klitschko noted that he was \"responsible for the capital of Ukraine\", describing it as \"the heart\" of the war-torn country.\nHe said Zelensky might be forced to take a \"painful solution\" to achieve peace.\nWhen asked whether Zelensky has been discussing with him any details of a possible settlement, Klitschko replied bluntly: \"No.\"\n\"President Zelensky does [it] himself. It's not my function,\" he added.\nReferring to a very public bust-up between Zelensky and Trump at the White House in February, the mayor suggested that key issues between top politicians would be better discussed \"without video cameras\".\nEarlier this week, Trump accused Zelensky of harming peace negotiations, after the Ukrainian leader again ruled out recognising Russian control of Crimea, a southern Ukrainian peninsula illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014.\nTrump has said \"Crimea will stay with Russia\", in an interview with Time magazine on Friday, having previously said the peninsula was \"lost years ago\".\nBut Zelensky has pointed to a 2018 \"Crimea declaration\" by Trump's then-secretary of state Mike Pompeo saying the US \"rejects Russia's attempted annexation\".\nUkraine and its European allies have in recent weeks expressed alarm over what many on the continent see as Trump's warming of relations with Vladimir Putin's Russia.\nIn later remarks made after his BBC interview about the possibility of Ukraine ceding territory, Klitschko said he \"did not say anything new\" and that many world politicians and media outlets were discussing it as a potential outcome of a peace deal.\n\"We understand that the scenario involving territorial concessions contradicts our national interests and we must fight against its implementation until the very end. This will require extraordinary efforts both from us and European partners,\" he added.\nAs talks ramp up, Russian strikes on Ukraine have continued.\nOn Thursday, an attack on Kyiv killed 12 people and injured dozens, officials said. The BBC witnessed the body of a child being brought out from the wreckage of their home while people quietly cried nearby.\nSvitlana, a teacher at a school close by which was also hit, spoke of her hurt and added she believed Russia would not stop its aggression if Ukraine gave up Crimea.\n\"Those who think that Putin will stop if he is given Crimea, they don't know who the Russians are, he is not going to stop,\" she said.\nShe said Zelensky expresses the opinion of \"all of us and we support him\".\nAnother woman, Olha, who had helped rescue workers carry out 10 people, five of whom were dead and the rest injured, was more critical.\n\"As of now I think it's better to be away from here because nothing good awaits us here,\" she said, adding there \"will not be a good solution\" for Ukraine.\nShe said Zelensky \"was a comedian and he should have stayed a comedian\"."

    "content": "The best friend of a woman who died from methanol poisoning on holiday has called on the government to do more to educate teenagers in schools about the dangers of drinking alcohol abroad.\nBethany Clarke was travelling in Laos in south-east Asia with childhood friend Simone White when they drank free shots they were offered in a hostel in November.\nThe following day, they both became unwell and initially thought they had food poisoning. But, a few days later, 28-year-old Simone died in hospital.\nThe Department for Education have been contacted for a comment about Bethany's petition.\nSimone, who was from Orpington in south-east London, and Bethany planned to stay in Cambodia for just under two weeks, and spend four days in Laos.\nThey fell ill after drinking six vodka shots served to them at the Nana Backpackers hostel in traveller hotspot Vang Vieng.\nFive other tourists also died after drinking at the hostel.\nTheir drinks are thought to have contained methanol - a deadly substance often found in bootleg alcohol.\nMedical specialists say drinking as little as 25ml of methanol can be fatal, but it is sometimes added to drinks because it is cheaper than alcohol.\nBut Bethany, 28, tells BBC Newsbeat they didn't even realise anything was wrong until the next day.\n\"This all happened on the fourth day of the trip. We did the tubing that day and that was good,\" she says.\n\"It's difficult to obviously describe the timeline. I think when I realised it was all going wrong was when we were on the kayaks for a trip we were doing the following morning. So just over 12 hours on.\n\"I guess that was when me and Simone were flat on the back of these kayaks, not being able to use our arms. We were just literally staring up into space.\n\"That was a moment where I thought I really don't understand what's happening to us. It just seemed like I was just having to accept my fate.\"\nBethany says even when they tried to get help, it took them a while to be treated for methanol poisoning and they had to search for information about it themselves.\n\"The doctors kept saying it was food poisoning, which obviously didn't help with trying to treat what was going on,\" she says.\n\"This is when our other friends said 'let's get to a private hospital'. In the ambulance on the way there our friend mentioned to the paramedic 'could it be methanol poisoning?' He'd done a little bit of research on his phone.\n\"They rushed Simone off to have dialysis straight away and said to me 'look can you just sign these forms and we'll do our best to save her life?'\n\"And yeah, they did their best.\"\nBethany says the group trusted the hostel because the reviews were good but she's now urging others to be careful.\n\"We didn't think we were doing anything stupid, but obviously now I do feel like I should have known more.\n\"The advice is from me 'steer clear, drink beer'. Look up the symptoms, be mindful about where you're drinking.\n\"Just don't let it be your best friend that dies from methanol poisoning.\"\nBethany's also set up a petition calling for the dangers of methanol poisoning to be put on the school curriculum in the UK.\nIt says \"children should be taught the dangers of consuming bootleg alcohol as part of the PSHE and/or Biology curriculum in school\".\n\"I think it just needs to be a five minute talk or possibly even some kind of public health advert, just giving the case study of Laos and saying this can happen,\" she says.\n\"If people want to take the risk and drink it, at least they've been educated and then they might even be able to spot some of the symptoms if they do happen to drink it.\"\nBethany is currently working in Australia and has since made a full recovery.\nShe says Simone was \"so full of life, energetic, sporty, musical - there's 100 adjectives I could probably come up with\".\n\"She was just the best friend that anybody could hope for.\n\"If you ever had a problem she'd always be trying to help you with it and she was just such a good listener.\"\nThe government has updated its information on methanol poisoning after what happened - there's a list of countries where its been reported and advice on how to spot it.\nA Foreign Office spokesperson said: \"We provided consular assistance to British nationals and their families and we remain in contact with the local authorities following an incident in Laos.\"\nThe Department for Education hasn't responded to Newsbeat about the petition, but its current guidance says students should be made fully aware of the risks of types of drugs and alcohol by the time they leave school.\nListen to Newsbeatliveat 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen backhere."

    "content": "Three months into Donald Trump's second term, Democrats are struggling with how to counter the White House juggernaut.\nSome are trying to revive the 2016 resistance. Some suggest \"playing dead\" in the hope that Trump flames out.\nBut former Democratic Senator Joe Manchin suggests a very different way, one many Democrats may find unpalatable - work with the president.\nIn a recent interview, one of the few he's given since leaving Congress in January, he told me:\n\"[Trump] is the leader of our country. Why would you not work with him? Just because he's a different party? Didn't vote for him? That's not a reason.\"\nFor years, Manchin was a unique politician who could win re-election as a Democrat in the deep-red Trump country of West Virginia.\nOccasionally, he was a thorn in the side of the Democratic Party, even voting against some of Joe Biden's key policies that couldn't, and didn't, survive without his support.\nBefore leaving office in January, Manchin changed his official designation from \"Democrat\" to \"Independent.\"\nIt's because Manchin is retired both from the Senate and from the Democratic Party that I wanted to get his thoughts on what's happening in Washington and how the Democrats would meet this moment. In my experience of politics, people tend to be more candid once they're no longer running for office.\n\"I want Donald Trump to succeed,\" Manchin told me. \"I want to help wherever I can help. I want to give them my experience of the mistakes I have made that we shouldn't make again.\"\nManchin says he hopes President Trump would also \"open his arms up\" and work with Democrats and Independents, but he clearly believes Democrats would do better with the electorate by working to get things done, rather than working to attack the president at every turn.\nIndeed, the most striking thing about our conversation is how he doesn't hold back on criticism of his former party.\nTake, for example, the case of Kilmar Ábrego García, a 29-year-old from El Salvador who was deported back to El Salvador last month after a governmental error and an immigration judge previously saying he should remain in the US.\n\"The Democrats are saying, 'what a horrible situation.'...They're making more of a case out of this one person who's an illegal immigrant being sent out of the country that could have been tied to a gang…if I'm a Republican strategist, I am going to keep quiet and just let you all go on.\"\nÁbrego García denies that he was a part of a gang - and the Trump administration hasn't provided any evidence to establish that he was. And, in our conversation, Manchin was also clear that Ábrego García should have had due process and that any attacks on the authority of America's judicial system should not be tolerated.\nBut, in Manchin's view, many of Trump's actions in the early days of this second term are not as objectionable to many Americans as they might be to Democratic officials in Washington.\n\"He's doing exactly what he said. People shouldn't be all upset,\" Manchin told me. \"The people who are upset right now lost. This is the system.\"\nRather than focus on immigration, he suggests, Democrats should focus on the biggest threat to America, the country's outsized debt. It could be an opportunity for them.\n\"We're 36 trillion dollars in debt. There's no way that we can handle this\" Manchin told me. \"If the Democrats wanted to reposition themselves, why don't they do it on fiscal policy? Do you ever hear anybody talking about balancing our budget, fiscal policy, living with our means?\"\nAnd he has concrete solutions he's keen to suggest for America's calcified political system. Term limits for a start.\n\"I believe the president should be one, six-year term, Katty. A president should never have to worry about getting re-elected. All they should do is their job.\"\nManchin also thinks members of Congress should be restricted to 12 years in office, and that Supreme Court justices should have terms of 18 years instead of their current lifetime appointments. It's something many younger Democratic politicians might well agree with as they look at the aging ranks of their party.\nTerm limits, however, would require congressional approval - from the same elderly members of Congress who are unlikely to vote themselves out of a job.\nDemocrats aren't in a mood to work with Trump, tackling the debt is on the back burner, term limits aren't likely to happen, but I find Manchin's observations valuable not because they're going to succeed but because they are the unfiltered recommendation of someone with a  unique position in American politics.\nHe is a one-time Democrat who repeatedly managed to get Trump country to vote him into office."

    "content": "Who will be the next pope? The decision could have a profound impact on the Catholic Church and the world's 1.4 billion baptised Roman Catholics.\nIt also promises to be a highly unpredictable and open process for a host of reasons.\nThe College of Cardinals will meet in conclave in the Sistine Chapel to debate and then vote for their preferred candidates until a single name prevails.\nWith 80% of the cardinals appointed by Pope Francis himself, they are not only electing a pope for the first time, but will offer a broad global perspective.\nFor the first time in history, fewer than half of those given a vote will be European.\nAnd although the college may be dominated by his appointments, they were not exclusively \"progressive\" or \"traditionalist\".\nFor those reasons, it is harder than ever to predict who will be elected the next pope.\nCould the cardinals elect an African or an Asian pope, or might they favour one of the old hands of the Vatican administration?\nHere are some of the names being mentioned as Francis's potential successor.\nNationality: Italian\nSoftly spoken Italian Cardinal Parolin was the Vatican's secretary of state under Pope Francis – making him the pope's chief adviser. The secretary of state also heads the Roman Curia, the Church's central administration.\nHaving acted effectively as deputy pope, he could be considered a frontrunner.\nHe is viewed by some as more likely to prioritise diplomacy and a global outlook than the purity of Catholic dogma. His critics consider that a problem, while his supporters see a strength.\nBut he has been critical of the legalisation of same-sex marriage around the world,  calling a landmark 2015 vote in favourin the Republic of Ireland \"a defeat for humanity\".\nThe bookmakers may back him but Cardinal Parolin will be well aware of an old Italian saying that stresses the uncertainty of the pope-picking process: \"He who enters a conclave as a pope, leaves it as a cardinal.\"\nSome 213 of the previous 266 popes have been Italian and even though there has not been an Italian pope in 40 years, the pivot of the upper echelons of the Church away from Italy and Europe may mean there may not be another for now.\nNationality: Filipino\nCould the next pope come from Asia?\nCardinal Tagle has decades of pastoral experience – meaning he has been an active Church leader among the people as opposed to a diplomat for the Vatican or cloistered expert on Church law.\nThe Church is massively influential in the Philippines, where about 80% of the population is Catholic. The country currently has a record five members of the College of Cardinals – which could make for a significant lobbying faction if they all back Cardinal Tagle.\nHe is considered a moderate within the Catholic definition, and has been dubbed the \"Asian Francis\" because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants that he shared with the late pope.\nHe has opposed abortion rights, calling them \"a form of murder\" – a position in line with the Church's broader stance that life begins at conception. He has also spoken against euthanasia.\nBut in 2015 when he was Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Tagle called for the Church to reassess its \"severe\" stance towards gay people, divorcees and single mothers, saying past harshness had done lasting harm and left people feeling \"branded\", and that each individual deserved compassion and respect.\nThe cardinal was considered a candidate to be pope as far back as the 2013 conclave in which Francis was elected.\nAsked a decade ago how he viewed suggestions he could be next, he replied: \"I treat it like a joke! It's funny.\"\nNationality: Congolese\nIt's very possible the next pope could be from Africa, where the Catholic Church continues to add millions of members. Cardinal Ambongo is a leading candidate, hailing from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).\nHe has been Archbishop of Kinshasa for seven years, and was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis.\nHe is a cultural conservative, opposing blessings for same-sex marriage, stating that \"unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil\".\nThough Christianity is the majority religion in the DRC, Christians there have faced death and persecution at the hands of jihadist group Islamic State and associated rebels. Against that backdrop, Cardinal Ambongo is viewed as a fierce advocate for the Church.\nBut in a 2020 interview, he spoke in favour of religious plurality, saying: \"Let Protestants be Protestants and Muslims be Muslims. We are going to work with them. But everyone has to keep their own identity.\"\nSuch comments could lead some cardinals to wonder if he fully embraces their sense of mission - in which Catholics hope to spread the Church's word throughout the world.\nNationality: Ghanaian\nIf chosen by his peers, the influential Cardinal Turkson would likewise have the distinction of being the first African pope for 1,500 years.\nLike Cardinal Ambongo, he has claimed not to want the job. \"I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a pope,\" he told the BBC in 2013.\nAsked if Africa had a good case to provide the next pope based on the Church's growth on the continent, he said he felt the pope shouldn't be chosen based on statistics, because \"those types of considerations tend to muddy the waters\".\nHe was the first Ghanaian to be made a cardinal, back in 2003 under Pope John Paul II.\nLike Cardinal Tagle, Cardinal Turkson was considered a potential pope a decade later, when Francis was chosen. In fact, bookmakers made him the favourite ahead of voting.\nA guitarist who once played in a funk band, Cardinal Turkson is known for his energetic presence.\nLike many cardinals from Africa, he leans conservative. However, he has opposed the criminalisation of gay relationships in African countries including his native Ghana.\nIn a BBC interview in 2023, while Ghana's parliament was discussing a bill imposing harsh penalties on LGBTQ+ people, Turkson said he felt homosexuality should not be treated as an offence.\nIn 2012, he was accused of making fear-mongering predictions over the spread of Islam in Europe at a Vatican conference of bishops, for which he later apologised.\nNationality: Hungarian\nA cardinal since the age of 51, Peter Erdo is highly regarded in the Church in Europe, having twice led the Council of European Bishops' Conferences from 2006 to 2016.\nHe is well known among African cardinals and he has worked on Catholic relations with the Orthodox Church.\nThe archbishop of Budapest and primate of Hungary grew up in a Catholic family under communism, and he is considered a potential compromise candidate.\nErdo played a prominent role in Pope Francis's two visits to Hungary in 2021 and 2023, and he was part of the conclaves that elected Francis and his predecessor Pope Benedict.\nHis conservative views on the family have found favour with some parts of the Church and he has navigated the \"illiberal democracy\" of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. During Europe's migrant crisis in 2015, he said the Church would not take in migrants as it was tantamount to human trafficking.\nNationality: Italian\nOnly cardinals under 80 can vote in the conclave, but Angelo Scola could still be elected.\nThe former Archbishop of Milan was a frontrunner in 2013 when Francis was chosen, but he is thought to have fallen victim to the adage of entering the conclave as Pope and leaving as cardinal.\nHis name has resurfaced ahead of the conclave, because of a book he is publishing this week on old age. The book features a preface written by Pope Francis shortly before he was admitted to hospital in which he said \"death is not the end of everything, but the beginning of something\".\nFrancis's words show genuine affection for Scola, but the college of cardinals might  not see his focus on old age as ideal for a new pope.\nNationality: German\nGermany's top Catholic cleric is also very much a Vatican insider too.\nThe Archbishop of Munich and Freising was chosen as an adviser when Francis became pope in 2013. For 10 years he advised the Pope on Church reform and still oversees financial reform of the Vatican.\nHe has advocated a more accommodating approach towards homosexuals or transgender people in Catholic teaching.\nBut in 2021 he offered to resign over serious mistakes in tackling child sexual abuse in Germany's Catholic Church. That resignation was rejected by Francis.\nTwo years ago he left the Council of Cardinals, the Pope's most important advisory body, in what was seen in Germany as a setback for his career in the Church.\nNationality: Canadian\nCardinal Ouellet has twice before been seen as a potential candidate for Pope, in 2005 and 2013.\nFor years he ran the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, which chooses candidates for the episcopate around the world, so he has played a significant and formative role in vetting the future members of the Catholic hierarchy.\nAs another octogenarian, he will not be able to play a part in the conclave itself, which may hinder his chances.\nOuellet is viewed as a conservative with a modern outlook, who is strongly in favour of maintaining the principle of celibacy for priests.\nHe opposes the ordination of women priests, but he has called for a greater role for women in running the Catholic Church, saying that \"Christ is male, the Church is feminine\".\nNationality: American\nCould the papacy go to an American for the first time?\nChicago-born Cardinal Prevost is certainly seen as having many of the necessary qualities for the role.\nTwo years ago Pope Francis chose Prevost to replace Marc Ouellet as prefect of the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, handing him the task of selecting the next generation of bishops.\nHe worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made an archbishop there.\nPrevost is not just considered an American, but as someone who headed the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.\nHe is seen a reformer, but at 69 might be viewed as too young for the papacy. His period as archbishop in Peru was also clouded by allegations of covering up sexual abuse claims, which were denied by his diocese.\nNationality: Guinean\nWell-liked by conservatives in the Church, Cardinal Sarah is known for his adherence to doctrine and traditional liturgy and was often considered opposed to Pope Francis's reformist leanings.\nThe son of a fruit-picker, Sarah became the youngest archbishop aged 34 when Pope John Paul II appointed him prelate in Conakry in Guinea.\nHe has had a long and impressive career, retiring in 2021 as head of the Vatican's office that oversees the Catholic Church's liturgical rites.\nWhile not considered a favourite for the papacy, he could attract strong support from conservative cardinals.\nNationality: Italian\nOrdained in Italy when he was 25, Pizzaballa moved to Jerusalem the following month and has lived there ever since.\nPope Francis made him Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem five years ago and later cardinal, and Pizzaballa has spoken of the city as \"the heart of the life of this world\".\nFellow cardinals will have been impressed by his deep understanding of Israelis and Palestinians and the ongoing war in Gaza.\nHowever, his relative young age and inexperience as a cardinal may count against him, as could his affinity to Francis among cardinals seeking a change in direction.\nNationality: Canadian\nCardinal Czerny was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis and is like him a Jesuit, a leading order of the Catholic Church known for its charitable and missionary work around the world.\nAlthough he was born in the former Czechoslovakia, his family moved to Canada when he was two.\nHe has worked widely in Latin America and in Africa, where he founded the African Jesuit Aids Network and taught in Kenya.\nCzerny is popular with progressives in the Church and was considered close to Pope Francis. He is currently head of the Vatican's Dicastery for Promoting Human Integral Development.\nAlthough a strong candidate, it seems unlikely the cardinals would choose a second Jesuit pope in succession."

    "content": "Northern Ireland's Mark Allen made an \"incredible\" 147 break but was left one frame away from defeat in the World Championship second round as Chris Wakelin dominated a thrilling session.\nAllen trailed 10-2 after losing the opening four frames of the morning on Friday. He went straight to the practice table in the interval and then produced snooker's moment of perfection in the first frame after the restart.\nIt made him only the 11th player to make a 147 at the Crucible. This was the 15th maximum in the main draw stage of the tournament and the first since Mark Selby's clearance in the 2023 final.\nHowever, world number 20 Wakelin, who beat former world champion Neil Robertson in round one, was not distracted and secured a 12-4 lead that means he only needs one more frame to move into the quarter-finals when the match resumes at 19:00 BST.\nThe maximum break was Allen's second 147 of the season, having made one during his third-round matchagainst Ben Mertensat the British Open, and the fifth of his career.\nThe achievement earns 39-year-old Allen £45,000 and is the 217th maximum in snooker's history. The cash bonus will be split if another player makes a 147 in the tournament.\nSeven-time world champion Stephen Hendry, speaking on BBC TV, called the maximum \"absolutely phenomenal\" and added: \"What a performance. Unbelievable. Incredible from Mark Allen.\n\"He was 10-2 behind and he's not scored a point for three frames, comes out after the interval and he makes a 147.\"\nComing to the Crucible is always special, but it became even more so for one fan as he pocketed £25,000 thanks to Allen's maximum.\nOne of the event's sponsors, Midnite Sports and Casino, has been running an initiative where for each session of this year's World Championship, one person in the crowd is selected at random and if a 147 happens, on either table, they win £25,000.\nThe lucky prize winner was named as Brian Nicholls from Tamworth, a lifelong snooker fan who had never been to the Crucible before and was bought a ticket by his son as a present for his 75th birthday.\nHe told the media he fancied taking his family on a cruise to America next year with the winnings.\n\"Twenty-five grand is a lot of money, it's lovely,\" he said. \"I wasn't calm, my heart was pounding. After the yellow, that was the ball where I thought 'it's on'. My son had pointed out a possible 147 with a few reds left.\n\"I though he [Allen] had blown it when he got to the yellow as they are only human and can make a mistake. When that black went in, wow, lovely!\n\"I couldn't believe it. The Crucible is a wonderful place, I've been walking around it having a look around. I hope Mark wins his match tonight and wins the tournament - I wanted to kiss him!\"\nIn the morning session on Friday, Wales' three-time champion Mark Williams ended level at 4-4 in his last-16 match with Iran's Hossein Vafaei.\nThere was only one break above 50 and that came from Williams with his 67 in frame four to make it 2-2.\nAfter his first-round win over China's Wu Yize, Williams said he hopes eye surgery in June will help toextend his snooker career.\nWilliams, who turned 50 in March, said around the time of his birthday that his \"eyes had completely gone\" and his eyesight had \"deteriorated quite badly\" in the previous six months.\nMeanwhile, Vafaei, 30, was also struggling with a shoulder injury and was seen regularly doing stretching exercises between frames.\nThe second session of three comes in the evening at 19:00 BST.\nFour-time champion John Higgins drew level at 8-8 through two sessions of his match with China's Xiao Guodong, with the final session beginning on Saturday at 10:00 BST.\nHiggins thought he had taken an 8-6 lead when it went down to a re-spotted black, which he potted, only to instantly lose the frame when the cue ball also went in.\nBut the Scot won the last frame of the afternoon with a break of 129, his second century of the match.\nChinese qualifiers Lei Peifan and Zhao Xintong gained fine wins in the first round over 2024 champion Kyren Wilson and last year's runner-up Jak Jones respectively.\nIn the first session of their last-16 match, Zhao moved into a 5-3 lead by winning the last three frames with breaks of 53, 97 and 61.\nZhao is currently classed as an amateur but will be returning full-time to the tour next season.\nIt comes following his return to the sport in September after serving a 20-month ban. He was one of 10 players from China to be punished in a match-fixing scandal.\nHe received the lightest penalty as he had not directly thrown a match but accepted charges of being a party to another player fixing two matches and betting on matches himself."

In all the years before, it was quite clear which clubs will probably get the top three or four positions.\n\"In my opinion, it's a really difficult league because that's what I've experienced over here, there's never been an easy game. It's always been very hard to win a game of football.\n\"We are not the only team in this league who find it difficult to win a game by three or four goals. That was maybe easier two, three, four or five years ago.\n\"Either the teams are not so good any more - the Liverpools, the Manchester Citys and the Arsenals - or we are still very good but the other teams have the funds to spend just as much or, in some situations, even more.\""

    "content": "Chris Eubank Jr will be fined £375,000 after missing the weight by just 0.05lb for Saturday's grudge match with Conor Benn.\nThe 35-year-old weighed 0.2lb over the 11st 6lb limit on the first attempt and was still too heavy the second time.\nA trimmed and toned Benn - who has operated at welterweight for most of his career - came in lighter than expected at 11st 2lb.\nEubank and Benn are both bound by a rehydration clause that prohibits them from weighing more than 12st 1lb on Saturday morning.\n\"Show me the money,\" said Benn, who will receive the fine, in a video posted on social media.\nBoth men are expected to earn a seven-figure purse for the fight.\nThe weigh-in took place behind closed doors at a London hotel on Friday.\nAfterwards, Eubank posted a video of himself, titled 'Pain is temporary... glory is forever', which was filmed earlier in the day. He was clearly in discomfort and in a sweatsuit trying to lose the weight.\nThere will be a ceremonial weigh-in, which will be open to the public, in Islington on Friday evening.\nThe fight is due to take place at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\nEubank's weight has been a major talking point in the build-up and particularly during fight week.\nBenn's team feel the rehydration clause allows for a more level playing field.\nFighters generally shed some fat over the period of their training camp to get close to the agreed or stipulated weight limit.\nBefore the weigh-in, which takes place a day before the fight night, they may dehydrate to lose the final bit of weight.\nLosing water weight close to the fight allows them to refuel with food and water much more easily.\nEubank is the more experienced fighter at middleweight but usually puts on about 14lb after a weigh-in.\nMatchroom promoter Hearn told BBC Sport both men will hit the scales at about 08:00 BST on Saturday. There will be a further fine if Eubank misses the weight again.\nBefore the weigh-in, he said his two options were to either put on what he usually would and then cut 4lb early on Saturday, or remain within the 10lb window.\nThe pair were set to fight in October 2022, reigniting a family rivalry after their fathers shared two bouts in the 1990s, before the fight was cancelled because Benn failed a drugs test.\nBenn called Eubank \"fat boy\" at Thursday's news conference. Promoter Eddie Hearn has also previously questioned whether Eubank would make the middleweight limit.\nEubank arrived an hour later than the scheduled 11:00 BST start time on Friday, sparking rumours he may be struggling at the weight.\nEubank was fined £100,000 for slapping Benn with an egg at a news conference in February. He has also voluntarily spent £50,000 on compensating boxers who were supposed to fight on the cancelled 2022 card.\nEubank has missed the weight by the smallest of margins, the weight of a single AA battery, which makes little change to the competitive element of this fight.\nThis is a bout already with a significant weight disparity and this incident - and Benn coming in lighter than anticipated - has served to shine a brighter light on that.\nBut we have to wonder what physical and mental impact this has had on Eubank.\nHow much of a toll has that gruelling cut taken on his body? And will he have similar trouble in trying to make the 12st 1lb limit tomorrow morning?\nThe psychological edge and momentum is certainly with Benn. We can expect some goading and taunting at the ceremonial weigh-in this evening."

    "content": "It's a big weekend for Nottingham Forest, Aston Villa, Crystal Palace and Manchester City, who are getting ready to play in the semi-finals of the FA Cup at Wembley.\nThree of the four - Forest, Villa and City - are also chasing top-five Premier League finishes that will secure a Champions League place next season.\nBut what matters more - winning the FA Cup or qualifying for the Champions League?\nOn Saturday, Crystal Palace take on Aston Villa in the first semi-final at 17:15 BST, a match you can watch live on BBC One, iPlayer, BBC Sport website and app.\nThe following day Nottingham Forest face Manchester City at 16:30 for a place in the final.\nWhile the winners of English football's showpiece final at Wembley on 17 May are guaranteed a major trophy - as well as a place in next season's Europa League - a top-five finish in the Premier League guarantees at least eight games in Europe's elite club competition.\nBut which is more important?\n\"The chance of a trophy is massive, regardless of anything else that is going on,\" former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha argues.\n\"Lifting silverware gives truly iconic moments.\n\"That is the stuff that you remember. For years to come fans recall the starting XIs, the squads, the managers, the run - everything.\"\nThis season's FA Cup has produced its fair share of surprises leading to a somewhat unfamiliar look to this weekend's semi-finals.\nRecord 14-time winners Arsenal went out in the third round, Premier League champions-in-waiting Liverpoolcame unstuck at Plymouthin the fourth round, while last season's winners Manchester United lost on penalties to Fulham at Old Trafford in the fifth round.\nCrystal Palace are the only one of the four remaining teams not to have won the FA Cup.\nBut while Manchester City have won two of the past six finals, it's been more than 60 years since Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest lifted the prestigious trophy.\nVilla might be seven-time winners but their last FA Cup triumph was in 1956-57.\nTwo-time winners Forest have won the European Cup on two occasions since they last won the FA Cup win in 1958-59.\nThe FA Cup final, watched by a global television audience of millions, is full of pomp and prestige, while the winners get to claim a major trophy in front of their fans at the national stadium.\nFrom a financial point of view, however, it is small change compared to the riches of the Champions League.\nAston Villa have earned a total of £910,000 in FA prize money for defeating West Ham, Tottenham, Cardiff and Preston in this season's FA Cup. They received £8.85m for winning five Champions League league-phase games this season.\nWhile reaching the Champions League last 16 also earned clubs an additional £9.27m each, Villa, Forest, City or Crystal Palace will receive just £2m in prize money if they win next month's FA Cup final.\nForest's last match in European football's premier club competition was in October 1980 when it was known as the European Cup before being rebranded the Champions League.\nWith five games to play, Nuno Espirito Santo's team sit fourth in the Premier League table with a three-point cushion between themselves and sixth-placed Chelsea.\n\"I want to be an FA Cup romantic, but Champions League football would provide such a big windfall that it offers a much better opportunity for establishing a strong foundation for future success,\" Forest fanBen tells BBC Sport.\nFellow Forest fan Simon has a different view.\n\"Yes, European football brings in cash. But winning a cup is eternal,\" he says.\n\"Look at the joy of Newcastle fans - they will remember this year more fondly than the year they made the top four.\"\nOnuoha adds: \"These are pinch-yourself moments for the Forest fans and if they get one and not the other, they can decide how they feel about that afterwards.\"\nVilla are desperate for more more big European nights under the floodlights after memorable wins over the likes ofBayern Munich,Bologna and Celtic.\nHaving lost 5-4 on aggregate to Paris St-Germain in the quarter-finals, Unai Emery's side must finish in the top five to play in next season's Champions League.\nThey currently lie seventh, two points off fifth having played one game more than the three teams immediately above them. Their goal difference is also inferior compared to their rivals.\nVilla, however, are two wins from a first major trophy since Brian Little's team defeated Leeds United in the 1996 League Cup final.\nDo they go all-out to win the FA Cup - or make finishing in the top five the priority?\n\"Of course the Premier League is our priority,\" said Villa boss Emery after his team's2-1 league defeat at Manchester Cityon Tuesday.\n\"We play in the Premier League to be in the top five.\"\nThis weekend Villa will play in their first FA Cup semi-final for 10 years and more than 30,000 of their fans are expected to be at Wembley to see them play Palace.\nEmery added: \"It's special to play in semi-finals. It's something we achieved with hard work. Now we must continue it.\"\nOnuoha believes the FA Cup semi-final is Villa's biggest game of the season.\n\"We saw with Newcastle what seeing your team lift silverware can mean to supporters and sometimes it's a once in a lifetime type thing,\" he added.\n\"Villa will want a chance to try and lift the trophy. You could very much make the case that it is the biggest game of their whole season so far.\n\"I think at times it is maybe taken for granted in this modern age of the financial power of Champions League qualification.\n\"The game is massive, the players will know it's massive, all those fans travelling down to Wembley will know it's massive.\n\"You can say the whole season could ride on this semi-final, and in some ways maybe it does. But isn't that always the case when you get a chance to play for silverware?\"\nIncredibly, this is the seventh successive season Manchester City have appeared at this stage of the FA Cup.\nThey've gone on to reach three finals, winning two of them in 2019 and 2023.\nYet missing out on the Champions League would be a huge blow for City and manager Pep Guardiola, who said\"we haven't done anything special with just one\"after being crowned champions of Europe for the first time in 2023.\nCity sit third in the table on 61 points, four more than sixth-placed Chelsea, who have one game in hand.\n\"Guardiola has spent a lot of this season making the point about how good this team has been in years gone by - like reaching seven FA Cup semi-finals in a row,\" said Onuoha.\n\"Many teams have not reached seven in their whole history so he has been more defiant in how he speaks about his team.\n\"He wants to make sure that people understand where he is coming from, where the club is coming from, how good they have been in years gone by, and how he still believes in the team.\"\nThe last time City failed to appear in the Champions League was way back in 2010-11 and Portuguese midfielder Matheus Nunes said qualifying for the competition was the number one priority in the final weeks of the season.\n\"It's important to go and win the semi-final, but I think our main goal is the Premier League, to try to qualify for the Champions League,\" Nunes said after the midweek league win over Villa.\n\"We are not looking to the FA Cup as a secondary thing, but our main focus is to win the remaining four league games.\""

    "summary": "Saturday's Copa del Rey final between Barcelona and Real Madrid is about more than just the trophy, writes Guillem Balague.",
    "content": "Football is theatre. Triumph or tragedy, fantasy or farce. But there's a moment just before the curtain rises, when the stage is still, the lights dim, and there's a silence that crackles with a mixture of tension and anticipation.\nThat's where Barcelona and Real Madrid find themselves now.\nAs the season winds toward its decisive final act, the two great rivals prepare for a double collision.\nSaturday's Copa del Rey final in Seville will be the first, while El Clasico will follow at Montjuic on 11 May. The outcomes will define not only trophies, but trajectories.\nFor Barcelona, a chance to complete a remarkable renewal, a chance to show their critics yet again that rumours about their death truly were exaggerated. For Madrid, perhaps a closing chapter, the end of this particular rodeo.\nAny antipathy that Barcelona may have had for Real Madrid in the past does not preclude the fact that for years it seemed that they wanted to be them. Ruthless, serial winners, immune to failure. In the past few years that search has been fruitless.\nBut something changed this season. With Hansi Flick at the helm, Barca have rediscovered that sometimes football isn't just about the result but also about the importance and value of the journey.\nThe football is still ambitious. Flick has instilled a kind of emotional clarity, guiding a group of hungry, youthful players with the calm of a manager who knows that the desire to grow and the need to win need not be mutually exclusive. Against Mallorca at the weekend, even with seven changes and a depleted XI, Barca delivered their most statistically dominant performance in years - 40 shots on goal.\nOnly one went in, but what mattered was the general idea did not change - they all think the same in that team right now. With key starters like Frenkie de Jong, Jules Kounde, Pau Cubarsi and Raphinha rested, Flick effectively revealed his starting line-up for Saturday's final.\nWhat makes this Barca different isn't just the tactical framework, it's the emotional one. Flick has shown an ability to manage expectations and egos with diplomacy.\nWhen Ferran Torres, Hector Fort and Ansu Fati reacted poorly to being benched against Celta two games ago, Flick didn't scold - he started all three against Mallorca. It wasn't a punishment or a reward. It was a reminder, a statement of intent. The team is a place for responses, not reactions. In that gesture, he transformed disappointment with purpose.\nWith several core players fresh and a day more to prepare than their rivals, Barca travel to Seville without excuses. They know what's at stake, and perhaps more importantly, they know who they are again.\nNo one embodies this rebirth better than Dani Olmo, their only real signing this summer. Forgotten through injury and bureaucratic fog, his season began in silence.\nOnly injuries have stopped him making an even bigger impression, but he always finds his moment, involved in 13 goals this season in 27 games (10 goals and three assists). Flick must now decide whether to use him from the start in Seville or hold him back as a decisive second-act character. With Lewandowski out, Olmo's clever movement and invention may be essential.\nThe spotlight also now falls on Ferran Torres. He is not a classic number nine but, in Flick's system, he doesn't need to be. He's dynamic, he presses well, and he's the competition's joint top scorer with five goals.\nThis is no longer the tentative Torres of old, desperate to impress; this is a striker who is happy to take on all the responsibility.\nThe final will also be another chance to enjoy 17-year-old Lamine Yamal, key in big games and someone who plays with something much more than mere confidence -total fearlesness. He gives Barca something few clubs have: unpredictability rooted in joy.\nAnd also a chance for Raphinha to claim his place among the best this season, a clear candidate for the Ballon D'Or with 27 goals and 16 assists in La Liga and the Champions League.\nBellingham's adaptation has entered a new phase at Real Madrid. He is no longer merely Madrid's star - he has become its standard.\nYet Ancelotti's frequent reminders about the need to show defensive efforts and the meetings he has called to talk about it with him, Rodrygo, Vinicius Jnr and Kylian Mbappe would suggest something is not working. Or make that someone, because Real Madrid cannot play at their best when at least two forward players (Mbappe and Vinicius Jr) - and sometimes three when Rodrygo also goes missing – decide that defending is the job of others and not them.\nIt also means Bellingham then has to do the work of two.\nIt has been a confusing season for Vinicius Jr, who is set to renew until at least 2029 after turning down astronomical sums from Saudi Arabia, matching Mbappe's wages and ensuring that he can continue to scatter his stardust in the white of Real Madrid.\nOn the pitch, he remains Madrid's eternal risk-taker - capable of brilliance, chaos, and sometimes both in the same play. Although he has impressed much less than last season, he has shown his ability to raise his game when needed.\nOnly four points separate both teams in the league, but this is not a Madrid at ease as they look back at the clubs' previous two meetings so far this season. Barcelona didn't just beat them – they destroyed them. The first time, 4-0 in the league at the Bernabeu on 26 October, and the second 5-2 on 12 January in the final of the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia.\nFor a club obsessed with image, results like these cut deep. This final is a chance to save face, to gain some kind of redemption.\nCarlo Ancelotti, with his future delicately poised, has spent the past months preaching balance and commitment. The expectation - unconfirmed but widespread - is that he will leave after the league campaign concludes to finalise his agreement with the Brazil national team.\nUntil then, he has to manage the final metres of this marathon.\nSantiago Solari is expected to take over for the Club World Cup in the summer. The long-term vision, as it stands, points toward Xabi Alonso beginning pre-season in July.\nBut one thing he will not do is negotiate what has brought him to where he is today and how he is perceived throughout the world of football. Publicly, Ancelotti insists: \"I'm not a coach who uses the whip. If that's what you want, hire someone else.\"\nHe is, by his own admission, a soft power.\n\"There's been talk of too much softness. But I've been angry plenty of times,\" Ancelotti said this week. \"Still, that doesn't mean I become authoritarian. I work with people, not robots.\"\nBut behind his serenity lies frustration this season. The mentioned calls for more intensity have largely gone unheeded and he considers this season has been one of the hardest of his career to balance egos.\nDefensively, the numbers reflect this drift. Only 12 clean sheets in 32 league games. No more than five consecutive wins in all competitions. If they are to salvage this season, it must begin now - with eight victories in a row, Copa included.\nWhatever happens in Seville, the season won't end there. El Clasico at Montjuic on 11 May may still crown the league champion.\nBarca will likely arrive with the advantage. Madrid, depending on the outcome of Saturday's final, may arrive as either reborn heroes or wounded guests.\nBut that is for another night."

    "section": "business",
    "summary": "The US central bank is one of Trump's favourite punching bags. But how serious is the threat?",
    "content": "US President Donald Trump has some well-known nemeses: illegal immigrants, low-flow showers and last, but definitely not least, the head of the US central bank.\nElevated by Trump to lead the Federal Reserve starting in 2018, Jerome Powell almost immediately found himself under fire - described on social media as a bonehead and questioned about reports that the president wanted him gone.\nBut however uncomfortable Powell might have been then, his position has only gotten worse.\nNot only is he overseeing an economy where the risk of recession is rapidly rising, Trump has been flirting publicly with his removal,writing on social media last week: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!\"\nComing at a time when Trump has pushed to expand presidential power, while cowing political opponents and ploughing past judicial efforts to check his action, it has raised alarm that he is more serious about, and might be more able to, exert control over the Fed than during his first term.\nThe tensions cooled this week, when Trump, a day after a market slide that some analysts tied to the comments, denied to reporters that he ever had any intention of firing Powell.\nIt came amid other hints of de-escalation in Trump's economic rhetoric as his policies, especially trade tariffs, have faced rising political and business backlash.\nBut Trump did not offer much assurance that he would limit his interventions at the Fed, maintaining his right to have a view and noting that he might call Powell to discuss his concerns about the bank's interest rate policy.\nDonald Kohn, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the former vice chair of the Federal Reserve, said the shift in tone appeared intended to calm financial markets but he did not think it marked the end of a fight over the Fed, an institution considered vital to the health of the world's largest economy.\n\"It's a testimony to the market's response,\" he said. \"But I think it's way too soon to say that there's a stability there.\"\nTrump's clash with the Fed is ostensibly rooted in differences over where the bank should fix its key interest rate, which plays an influential role shaping borrowing costs for credit cards, mortgages and other loans.\nLower rates make it easier to borrow and tend to deliver an economic boost. Higher interest rates dampen activity, helping to keep prices stable.\nTrump, who cut his teeth professionally taking out loans as a property developer, has long confessed to liking a low interest rate policy.\nHe objected when the Fed raised rates in his first term and has been pushing Powell to cut them now, arguing that inflation has cooled and keeping rates too high could do unnecessary economic damage.\n\"There can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,\" he wrote on social media earlier this week, referring to Powell.\nTrump is hardly the first politician to cast the bank as a scapegoat at a moment of economic turmoil - or to press for lower interest rates.\nNor is he alone in his criticism of Powell, who infamously initially dismissed post-pandemic price inflation as \"transitory\" and has been faulted for being too focused on backward-looking data.\nTrump's pressure on the bank, however, breaks with Washington tradition in recent decades of presidential deference to the Fed.\nIt has drawn comparisons to former President Richard Nixon, who pushed his Fed chairman to loosen its policies ahead of the 1972 election, moves later blamed for feeding the high-inflation, low-growth \"stagflationary\" dynamic of that decade.\nThe idea that Trump could exert control over the Fed elicits horror among many economists, who say history is littered with examples of countries where political interference at central banks led to spiralling prices and economic ruin.\nSarah Binder, professor at George Washington University and a scholar of the Federal Reserve, said confidence in Fed independence is key to maintaining market faith that inflation will be controlled.\nIf shaken, it could lead to higher borrowing costs for everyone, as investors demand higher interest rates for holding debt, she warned, noting that should the Fed eventually cut rates, it is likely to spark speculation about Trump's influence - regardless of how, if at all, it played into the decision.\n\"That's ultimately the problem. It is perceptions of independence that really matter and that's what the pernicious effects of the attacks are they do raise doubts about whether the Fed can be as stalwart as central bankers want to be,\" she said.\nJoe Lavorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, who served on the National Economic Council during Trump's first term, said he saw little need for Trump to dial back his attacks, noting that he was making a \"very classic macro argument\" about the bank's flaws.\n\"I'm completely on board with the president's sympathies or comments that the Fed has historically been late,\" he said, adding that he thought stock market falls had been driven primarily by questions about trade policy.\nHe said he believed that Fed officials would remain more responsive to financial conditions than the president, noting that, if anything, Trump's pressure could make it more hesitant to cut, lest it be perceived as being cowed.\n\"Ultimately the Fed is going to do what's prudent,\" he said. \"The question is just the timing.\"\nPowell, a longtime Washington lawyer whose term as chair is due to end next year, has maintained that he is unbothered - and uninfluenced - by the criticism and asserted that Trump does not have the legal authority to remove him.\nBut the strength of his position is a matter of legal debate.\nBy law, Fed governors can only be removed for cause, but it is unclear whether that protection extends to the role leading the board.\nThe administration has already taken steps to reduce the Fed's regulatory role and is engaged in a legal battle over expanding presidential authority over other government agencies set up with features, like for cause protections, intended to insulate them from partisan pressure.\nMark Spindel, founder and chief investment officer of the Washington-based investment advisory firm Potomac River Capital, who has worked with Prof Binder on Fed studies, noted that the tradition of Fed \"independence\" had evolved over time, often after political or economic crisis.\n\"Things that are given can be taken away,\" he said, hours before Trump appeared to back off.\nAsked again for his thoughts a few days later, Mr Spindel wrote back just two words in reply: \"Damage done.\""

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86je4vyg36o",
    "section": "business",
    "summary": "Australia has proposed to create a strategic reserve of critical minerals.",
    "content": "Australia's prime minister Anthony Albanese has pledged to invest A$1.2bn (£580m) in a strategic reserve for critical minerals if he wins next month's election, as trade tensions escalate.\nThe announcement came after China imposed export restrictions on seven rare earth elements, essential to the production of advanced technologies - including electric vehicles, fighter jets, and robots.\nChina's controls apply to all countries but were widely seen asretaliation to US President Donald Trump's tariffs.\nAlbanese said Australia would prioritise minerals that are key to its security, and that of its partners, including rare earths. But could his plan challenge China's dominance?\nRare earths are a group of 17 elements - named \"rare\" because they are notoriously difficult to extract and refine.\nRare earths, like samarium and terbium, are critical to the production of technologies set to shape the world in the coming decades – including electric vehicles and highly advanced weapons systems.\nAlbanese's proposed reserve includes rare earths as well as other critical minerals of which Australia is a top producer - like lithium and cobalt.\nBoth China and Australia have rare earth reserves. But 90% of rare earth refining – which makes them usable in technology – takes place in China, giving the country significant control over supply.\nAnd that has spooked Western governments.\nBeijing said its restrictions on rare earths were in response to Trump's sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports to the US, currently at 145%.\nBut analysts say Washington's inability to secure the supply of rare earths has become one of the Trump administration's chief anxieties, especially as diplomatic tensions with Beijing have deepened.\nAround 75% of US rare earth imports came from China between 2019 and 2022, according to the US Geological Survey.\nPhilip Kirchlechner, director of Iron Ore Research in Perth, Western Australia, told the BBC that the US and EU had \"dropped the ball\" on recognising the importance of the rare earths over recent decades, as China swiftly developed a monopoly over refinement.\n\"China has its foot on the blood vein… of US and European defence systems,\" he added.\nElon Musk, CEO of Tesla, this week said that China halting exports of rare earths used in advanced magnets was affecting the company's ability to develop humanoid robots, in an early symbol of the pain Beijing has the power to inflict on US companies.\nAlbanese's proposal says that minerals in the reserve will be available to both \"domestic industry and international partners\", in a likely reference to allies such as the US and EU.\nBut Kirchlechner, while welcoming the move as \"long overdue\", added that the proposal is \"not going to solve the problem\".\nThe fundamental issue is that even if Australia stockpiles more critical minerals, the refining process of rare earths will still largely be controlled by China.\nLithium – not a rare earth, but a crucial metal in the production electric vehicle batteries and solar panels – is a good example. Australia mines 33% of the world's lithium, but only refines and exports a tiny fraction. China, on the other hand, mines just 23% of the world's lithium, but refines 57% of it, according to the International Energy Agency.\nAustralia has been investing in refining rare earths as part of its Future Made in Australia plan, aimed at leveraging the country's critical minerals reserves to drive the green transition.\nArafura Rare Earths, headquartered in Perth, Western Australia, last year received A$840m in funding to create the country's first combined mine and refinery for rare earths. And in November, Australia opened its first rare earths processing plant, also in Western Australia, operated by Lynas Rare Earths.\nBut the country is expected to depend on China for refining until at least 2026, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, headquartered in Washington.\nChina has been trying to seize on the volatility brought by Trump.\nIn a series of editorials in Australian newspapers, China's ambassador to Canberra lambasted Washington's approach to global trade, and called on Australia to \"join hands\" with Beijing - something that Albanese quickly rejected.\nAustralia has touted its resource industry in its talks with Trump. Some critical minerals were exempt from a 10% tariff he imposed on imports of most Australian products.\nBut analysts say Albanese's proposal is mainly aimed at protecting Australia and its partners from strategic adversaries like China.\nAlicia García-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis, told the BBC that Albanese's plan was \"more sophisticated\" than previous proposals, because it included the ability to sell Australia's resources at moments of economic tension.\nIf China imposes export controls, she added, Australia could begin selling more of its mineral reserves to help lower prices on global markets, and loosen the control China has had on setting prices.\nBut she said that Australia still cannot completely replace China.\n\"If [Australia's] goal is to serve the West, become more instrumental to the West – especially the US – there are weak spots China can enter – and the most important is refining.\""

The firm's shares fell after it withdrew its annual results forecast.\n\"The current environment is simply too dynamic from which to plan results with a reasonable assurance of success,\" Skechers' chief operating officer, David Weinberg, told investors in a post-earnings call.\nSkechers - like rivals Nike, Adidas and Puma - uses factories in Asia, particularly in China, to make its products.\nComments from Procter & Gamble (P&G) executives also hinted at how tariffs could mean higher prices for its customers.\nThe maker of Ariel, Head & Shoulders and Gillette said it was considering changes to its prices to make up for the extra cost of materials sourced from China and other places. It also said it expected sales to grow this year less than previously forecast.\n\"We'll be looking for every opportunity to mitigate the impact,\" said Andre Schulten, P&G's financial chief, adding that there will be adjustments to \"some level of consumer pricing\".\nThe Japanese owner of the 7-Eleven convenience stores, Seven & I, said it is also feeling the impact of the trade tensions.\nNorth America account for more than 70% of its sales.\nIts incoming chief executive, Stephen Dacus, told the BBC about the uncertainty faced by the business.\n\"We don't know what those tariffs are going to be. We've seen some news recently where they have changed quite a bit so it's a little bit difficult to understand what the ultimate effect is,\" he said.\n\"Lowering prices and lowering quality typically doesn't work... so what you have to do... is find ways to maintain quality while bringing the cost down\".\nThey join a growing list of examples of companies around the world that have warned about the impact of Trump's trade policies.\nSouth Korean car making giant Hyundai announced on Friday that it has set up a task force to find ways to deal with the fallout from tariffs.\n\"We expect a challenging business outlook to continue due to intensifying trade conflicts and other various unpredictable macroeconomic factors,\" it said.\nIt added that it is considering moving some manufacturing out of South Korea.\nThe firm has already shifted some production from Mexico to the US, which accounts for about a third of its global sales.\nMeanwhile, there were signs that talks on Thursday between US and South Korean trade officials in Washington DC, aimed at removing tariffs, have been positive.\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the two sides had a \"very successful\" meeting.\n\"We may be moving faster than I thought, and we will be talking technical terms as early as next week,\" he told reporters after the meeting.\nSouth Korea's industry minister, Ahn Duk-geun, who also took part in the talks, echoed Bessent's optimism and added that they are working toward a \"July package\".\nA 90-day pause on higher tariffs affecting dozens of countries is set to expire on 8 July.\nTrump has said more than 70 countries have reached out to start negotiations since the tariffs were announced."

The state now only trails Germany, China and the US as a whole.\n\"California isn't just keeping pace with the world - we're setting the pace,\" Newsom said.\nThe new figures come as Newsom has spoken out against President Donald Trump's tariffs and voiced concern about the future of the state's economy.\nCalifornia has the largest share of manufacturing and agricultural production in the US. It is also home to leading technological innovation, the centre of the world's entertainment industry and the country's two largest seaports.\nNewsom, a prominent Democrat and possible presidential candidate in 2028,filed a lawsuitchallenging Trump's authority to impose the levies, which have caused disruption to global markets and trade.\nTrump has enacted 10% levies on almost all countries importing to the US, after announcing a 90-day pause on higher tariffs.\nAnother 25% tariff was imposed on Mexico and Canada. The levies on China, however, have led to an all-out trade war with the world's second largest economy.\nTrump imposed import taxes of up to 145% on Chinese goods coming into the US and China hit back with a 125% tax on American products.\nHis administration said last week that when the new tariffs were added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.\nNewsom noted his worries about the future of the state's economy.\n\"While we celebrate this success, we recognise that our progress is threatened by the reckless tariff policies of the current federal administration,\" he said. \"California's economy powers the nation, and it must be protected.\"\nTrump has argued his trade war is only levelling the playing field after years of the US being taken advantage of.\nThe tariffs are an effort to encourage factories and jobs to return to the US.

    "summary": "Humanoid robots are attracting a lot of investment but will China dominate the industry?",
    "content": "It's a bright spring morning in Hanover, Germany, and I'm on my way to meet a robot.\nI have been invited to see the G1, a humanoid robot built by Chinese firm, Unitree, at the Hannover Messe, one of the world's largest industrial trade shows.\nStanding at about 4'3\" (130cm), G1 is smaller and more affordable than other humanoid robots on the market, and has such a highly fluid range of motion and dexterity that videos of it performing dance numbers andmartial arts have gone viral.\nToday the G1 is being controlled remotely by Pedro Zheng, the Unitree sales manager.\nHe explains that customers must program each G1 for autonomous functions.\nPassers-by stop and actively try to engage with the G1, which cannot be said for a lot of the other machines being shown off in the cavernous conference room.\nThey reach out to shake its hand, make sudden movements to see if it will respond, they laugh when G1 waves or bends backwards, they apologise if they bump into it. There's something about its human shape that, uncanny as it is, sets people at ease.\nUnitree is just one of dozens of companies around the world developing robots that have a human form.\nThe potential is huge - for business it promises a workforce that doesn't need holidays or pay rises.\nIt could also be the ultimate domestic appliance. After all, who wouldn't want a machine that could do the laundry and stack the dishwasher.\nBut the technology is still some way off. While robotic arms and mobile robots have been common in factories and warehouses for decades, conditions in those workplaces can be controlled and workers can be kept safe.\nIntroducing a humanoid robot to a less predictable environment, like a restaurant or a home, is a much more difficult problem.\nTo be useful humanoid robots would have to be strong, but that also makes them potentially dangerous - simply falling over at the wrong time could be hazardous.\nSo much work needs to be done on the artificial intelligence that would control such a machine.\n\"The AI simply has not yet reached a breakthrough moment,\" a Unitree spokesperson tells the BBC.\n\"Today's robot AI finds basic logic and reasoning – such as for understanding and completing complex tasks in a logical way – a challenge,\" they said.\nAt the moment their G1 is marketed at research institutions and tech companies, who can use Unitree's open source software for development.\nFor now entrepreneurs are focussing their efforts on humanoid robots for warehouses and factories.\nThe highest profile of those is Elon Musk. His car company, Tesla, is developing a humanoid robot called Optimus.In January he saidthat \"several thousand\" will be built this year and he expects them to be doing \"useful things\" in Tesla factories.\nOther carmakers are following a similar path. BMWrecently introduced humanoid robotsto a US factory. Meanwhile, South Korean car firm Hyundaihas ordered tens of thousandsof robots from Boston Dynamics, the robot firm it bought in 2021.\nThomas Andersson, founder of research firm STIQ, tracks 49 companies developing humanoid robots - those with two arms and legs. If you broaden the definition to robots with two arms, but propel themselves on wheels, then he looks at more than 100 firms.\nMr Andersson thinks that Chinese companies are likely to dominate the market.\n\"The supply chain and the entire ecosystem for robotics is huge in China, and it's really easy to iterate developments and do R&D [research and development],\" he says.\nUnitree underlines that advantage - its G1 is cheap (for a robot) with an advertised price of $16,000 (£12,500).\nAlso, Mr Andersson points out, the investment favours Asian nations.\nIn a recent report STIQ notesthat almost 60% of all funding for humanoid robots has been raised in Asia, with the US attracting most of the rest.\nChinese companies have the added benefit of support from the national and local government.\nFor example, in Shanghai there isa state-backed training facilityfor robots, where dozens of humanoid robots are learning to complete tasks.\nSo how can US and European robot makers compete with that?\nBristol-based Bren Pierce has founded three robotics companies and the latest, Kinisi has just launched the KR1 robot.\nWhile the robot has been designed and developed in the UK, it will be manufactured in Asia.\n\"The problem you get as a European or American company, you have to buy all these sub-components from China in the first place.\n\"So then it becomes stupid to buy your motors, buy your batteries, buy your resistors, shift them all halfway around the world to put together when you could just put them all together at the source, which is in Asia.\"\nAs well as making his robots in Asia, Mr Pierce is keeping costs down by not going for the full humanoid form.\nDesigned for warehouses and factories, the KR1 does not have legs.\n\"All of these places have flat floors. Why would you want the added expense of a very complex form factor... when you could just put it on a mobile base?\" he asks.\nWhere possible, his KR1 is built with mass-produced components - the wheels are the same as you would find on an electric scooter.\n\"My philosophy is buy as many things as you can off the shelf. So all our motors, batteries, computers, cameras, they're all commercially available, mass produced parts,\" he says.\nLike his competitors at Unitree, Mr Pierce says that the real \"secret sauce\" is the software that allows the robot to work with humans.\n\"A lot of companies come out with very high-tech robots, but then you start needing a PhD in robotics to be able to actually install it and use it.\n\"What we're trying to design is a very simple to use robot where your average warehouse or factory worker can actually learn how to use it in a couple of hours,\" Mr Pierce says.\nHe says the KR1 can perform a task after being guided through it by a human 20 or 30 times.\nThe KR1 will be given to pilot customers to test this year.\nSo will robots ever break out of factories into the home? Even the optimistic Mr Pierce says it's a long way off.\n\"My long term dream for the last 20 years has been building the everything robot. This is what I was doing my PhD work in I do think that is the end goal, but it's a very complicated task,\" says Mr Pierce.\n\"I still think eventually they will be there, but I think that's at least 10 to 15 years away.\""

    "content": "The UK's trade relationship with the EU is arguably \"more important\" than the one it has with the US, the chancellor has told the BBC.\nRachel Reeves suggested that moving closer to the EU on trade was a bigger priority, despite her current focus on talks with the US.\nAhead of her meeting with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday, Reeves said the government was working \"flat out\" to secure a trade deal with the US.\nEarlier this week, she signalled the UK could lower tariffs on US car imports from their current 10% to 2.5% as part of a wider deal.\nThe UK is preparing for a summit with the EU in May in an attempt to \"reset\" the relationship between the two.\n\"I understand why there's so much focus on our trading relationship with the US but actually our trading relationship with Europe is arguably even more important, because they're our nearest neighbours and trading partners,\" she told the BBC.\n\"Obviously I've been meeting Scott Bessent this week whilst I'm in Washington, but I've also this week met the French, the German, the Spanish, the Polish, the Swedish, the Finnish finance ministers - because it is so important that we rebuild those trading relationships with our nearest neighbours in Europe, and we're going to do that in a way that is good for British jobs and British consumers.\"\nA Downing Street spokesman said the chancellor's remarks had been \"a statement of fact that the EU is our largest trading partner\".\nThe spokesman also highlighted comments that Sir Keir Starmer has made previously where he had said it was a \"false choice between the EU and the US\".\nConservative shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith told Sky News that his party would \"absolutely be seeking to prioritise\" a deal with the US over the EU.\nGriffith argued that the UK already had a tariff-free deal on goods with the EU, therefore the \"next best choice if you want to grow the economy after the chancellor's crashed it would be to get a deal with the US\".\nLiberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper MP said: \"The chancellor is absolutely right that our trading relationship with Europe is more important, but the government's approach so far shows these are little more than empty words.\n\"This government has bent over backwards to appease Donald Trump but barely lifted a finger to unleash growth by boosting trade with Europe.\"\nRegarding the situation with the US, Reeves said she \"understands what President [Donald] Trump wants to address\" with his tariffs, ahead of talks with her US counterpart in Washington.\nReeves said there were similarities with the way both the US and UK governments had come to power off the back of voter frustration with the economy.\n\"We're all grappling with this issue of tariffs but I think that there is an understanding why President Trump wants to address some of the global imbalances there are in the system,\" she said.\nTrump has already imposed tariffs of 25% on all car imports to the US including from the UK.\nThe UK also faces a broader tariff rate of 10% and is looking to negotiate an agreement with the US administration, along with dozens of other countries hit with even higher levies – most of which are currently on pause until July.\nSome US officials have been positive about the prospects of a deal. Last week US Vice-President JD Vance said there was a \"good chance\" a trade deal could be reached with the UK.\nReeves said she had also been working closely with European and Canadian counterparts to remove trade barriers, and that conversations around the table at G20 meetings this week had been difficult.\n\"Obviously there are strains. We are all following what's happening in our domestic bond markets, in our equity markets, and we all know that that uncertainty is bad for investment in the UK economy.\"\nYou can watch Faisal's full interview with Rachel Reeveshere.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletterto keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond."

    "summary": "A weekly summary of the big stories from financial markets around the world.",
    "content": "The former Google and Yahoo executive believes AI should simplify our lives but warns the real battle for the future will be determined by how the US and China embrace this technology.\nMarissa Mayer has spent her career at the centre of some of Silicon Valley's biggest moments. She was among Google's earliest employees and its first female engineer, helping to shape the search engine's user experience. She played a key role in many of the company's other now well-known products including maps and Gmail during her 13 years there. Later she would spend five-years asYahoo's CEO and president, leading the company during a particularly challenging period. Throughout her career, Mayer has always been drawn to the intersection of technology and consumer experience.\nRecently, she's been tackling a new challenge at Sunshine, her AI-driven startup focused on making everyday tasks more seamless, starting with managing users' phone contacts and reminding them about birthdays. The company's latest AI-powered photo sharing app reflects Mayer's broader vision for how technology can enhance personal connections and interactions.\n\"I'm a techno-optimist,\" Mayer tells the BBC. \"I believe that AI, when applied thoughtfully, can free up time, strengthen relationships and ultimately bring more joy.\"\nOver the years, Mayer has served on the boards of companies including Walmart and AT&T while also backing startups such as Minted and Square. In 2018, a year afterresigning from Yahoofollowing the sale of its operating business toVerizon for $4.48bn (£3.6bn), Mayer co-founded Lumi Labs with former colleague Enrique Muñoz Torres, with the ambition of bringing AI to everyday consumer tasks. The company rebranded in 2020 as Sunshine after unveiling its first product, Sunshine Contacts, which aimed to use AI to rearrange smartphone users' contacts, delete duplicates and keep information up-to-date. Later it would launch Sunshine Birthdays, which promised to help avoid missing someone's birthday ever again by reminding users and allowing them to order gifts or cards within the app.\nThe company has since pivoted to Shine: Photo Messaging, a free AI-powered app that claims to help users organise and share photos with facial recognition and automation. It's focused on recognising friends in photos and understanding who was together – whether for a BBQ, wedding or baseball game – by using contacts, location data and facial recognition to cluster images and automatically share them without the usual hassle. Still, like many AI-driven platforms, particularly those using facial recognition, the concept raises questions about data privacy and storage. (The company's websitesaysit puts privacy first by requiring user consent before sharing photos but does store data and disclose certain information to third parties butdoes not sell it).\nAlthough she sees AI's potential to make people's lives easier, Mayer acknowledges there are  challenges ahead, particularly when it comes to regulation, consumer trust, and ethical oversight of this emerging technology.\nMayer spoke to the BBC about her vision for Sunshine, the evolving role of AI in daily life and what keeps her up at night.\nAfter spending years running Yahoo and parts of Google, how did you decide what you wanted to do next?\nI always wanted to be an entrepreneur and try founding something. I've always thought about how technology can bring people closer together and give people more time back. There were lots of things I loved about Google Search for the decade that I ran it, and one was giving people information and their time back because search was better, faster and more efficient. When I founded Sunshine, I really wanted to think about how we could make people's relationships stronger, and how people could spend less time on the screen tapping on things, and more time with each other doing things that are of higher value.\nWhat do you make of big tech's close relationship with President Donald Trump's administration?\nI'm by no means a political expert. So, I think that's an area I'm really remiss to comment on. I know overall I respect a lot of the players who are in the space and in that political dialogue on both sides. But I think it's really hard to say… particularly in the tech space where things are moving so quickly.\nAre you concerned about tariffs on trade and imports impacting your company? For example, a memo signed by President Donald Trump recently promised toimpose tariffs on digital servicesfrom countries that placed burdensome regulations on US technology companies.\nI think eventually it may touch the company, but right now we're very focused on the US and English-speaking markets – and it's all digital goods. At the moment, I think the tariffs are unlikely to affect us.\nYou've long been one of the more prominent female leaders in tech. How do you view the progress made for women in the industry? What are some of the biggest remaining challenges there?\nA lot has happened over the past 25 years of my career. I've been lucky to have been at places that are very empowering to women. That was true both at Google and Yahoo and it certainly is at Sunshine. It's also been true in my board work within those companies. I would like to see more women entering tech. It involves acquiring talent and retaining talent by having the right environment where they can be promoted and thrive. One of the things we identified early at Google was that, yes, there needs to be more women, but you also need to have an environment with men who are good at working with women. It's about selecting for an accepting environment.\nSilicon Valley has long been associated with a \"tech bro\" culture. How have you seen the culture evolve over time?\nAt Google, we were so focused… that gender really did fade into the background. I didn't think about the fact that I was one of a few technical women there. In my leadership team at Yahoo, we had more than half women. Here at Sunshine, more than half of our engineers are women. I've always been in playing fields where I think women have been really respected and very much on equal footing, even if we weren't at equal numbers. From that perspective, I didn't necessarily have a hard time because I started my career at Google and was there for the first 13 years. A lot of strong women came out of that culture… including Jen Fitzpatrick [senior VP of core systems and experiences], who's very senior there now, and Sheryl Sandberg [former chief operating officer at Meta].\nWhat did you learn during your time at Yahoo and Google that you're bringing over to Sunshine?\nSo many things. I will say that focus on the product and a great user experience at the center of the design and development process has been part of all the companies I've been involved with. It's a very centering force. It's what really drives our ambition… and turns out superior technologies.\nYou joined Yahoo at a time when it faced challenges in innovation and competition. What do you believe was your greatest accomplishment there?\nOn the product side, I came to Yahoo to bring the company into the mobile era. When I arrived, we basically had no mobile products… and less than 30 global engineers in the company of 18,000. In fairness to Yahoo, it was 2012. I had really sold the board on the idea that much of what Yahoo had in its arsenal was stock, sports scores, news, weather, email and things that could thrive on the phone. But to do that, we had to build a mobile team.\nThe first half of my time there – two and a half years – we had 600 mobile engineers. Apple identified us as the biggest iOS shop in the world. We won back-to-back app of the year awards – when Apple was only giving one a year – for Yahoo weather and Yahoo user Digest. We transformed that product suite and really brought it into the mobile era and ultimately started generating almost $2bn (£1.6bn). And part of that was the growth of mobile. So I'm really proud of what we accomplished in terms of the product offering and making it mobile first.\nHow does Shine differentiate itself in a marketplace crowded with photo sharing services?\nFor the first few years at Sunshine, we worked on contacts and built what I believe is a best-of-breed contacts app. We are really overall excited about it, but it is not viral. No one walks around saying, oh my gosh, my contact manager is so great. So this past year, we've pivoted and gone to something in the space that everyone else is more passionate about, and that's photos and events. But it's the same idea… how do you apply AI to everyday tasks? How can these technologies bring people closer together and give them time back?\nTell us how Shine does that for photos.\nRight now, we're really focused on how we can help people share photos more efficiently by recognising your friends in photos and making it easier to share in small groups. If you're just going to share a photo person-to-person, you can text. If you want to share it with hundreds of people, there's always Instagram and Threads. But if you actually want to take a whole set of photos from [an experience] and then share it with anywhere from five to a few hundred people, that almost certainly involves cross-platforms between iOS and Android, which means neither Google Photos nor Apple Photos is really often the right solution for that group.\nIt's often so much trouble that people just don't share the photos at all. So it's taking things like facial recognition, an understanding of your contacts and location and really trying to put together a whole picture of: who is this group, why were they together, and how would they want to share that photo.\nAs an AI startup, do you worry about AI regulations?\nPartnerships between the government and thought leaders on both sides, both pessimists and optimists, are going to be absolutely critical. Even experts and people who are trying to stay apprised of everything, and really understand where things are and where they're going, have blind spots. It's very hard right now to keep up. I worry that sometimes we [in the US] get into a mindset that's very isolationist, thinking just about the US or the West. We don't necessarily think about the fact that there are a lot of AI technologies being developed elsewhere – in China in particular. They may have very different value systems than what we have. If we pump the brakes too hard with regulation and regulate this innovation, I don't think that same slowing will happen there.\nI thinkDeepSeekmakes the point more obvious now. The real competition in terms of how AI is developed and adopted is between the US and China, not between any two companies. Inherent to the US-China AI competition is a tension between the common good and individual liberties, particularly in terms of how the AI is used. Which country is the leader in the AI space will fundamentally impact our global future. This isn't necessarily a values-based statement about which is better, but it raises questions like whether AI should prioritise public safety through large-scale surveillance or uphold strict privacy protections even at the risk of reduced oversight.\nWhere do you think we'll be with AI in the next year or even five to 10 years?\nI'm incredibly optimistic about AI. I hope that it touches most of what we do. There's an adage that people tend to overestimate the short term and underestimate the long term, and that's true generally in technology. I remember being five and watching the Jetsons and being like, wow, when I'm 30 they'll be flying cars. I'll be almost 50... and we're well past that mark and nowhere close to a safe flying car yet, but they are getting closer all the time.\nAt the same time, when I was five, the internet didn't even exist. It has really transformed everything in terms of how we work, learn and navigate the world. AI is moving very fast. I wonder if this is going to be one of the first technologies that breaks that adage where it actually might surpass our expectations in the near term. I certainly think it's going to surpass our expectations in the longer term in terms of what it can do and what can happen.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week."

    "content": "China has called on the US to cancel its sweeping tariffs on Chinese goods entering the country as a sign that US President Donald Trump is serious about resolving the trade war between the two countries.\nA Chinese official said there had been no trade talks with the US, despite suggestions otherwise from the Trump administration.\nThe trade war between the world's two largest economies has been escalating, with China sending back Boeing planes it ordered from the US in its latest retaliation over tariffs.\nBut Trump has appeared to soften his stance on China, saying that the taxes he has so far imposed on Chinese imports would \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".\nA trade war between China and the US is in full swing, with Trump imposing import taxes of up to 145% on Chinese goods coming into the US, and China hitting back with a 125% tax on American products.\nIn one of China's strongest statements yet over the tariff war, Commerce Ministry spokesman He Yadong said the US should remove all \"unilateral tariff measures\" against China \"if it truly wanted\" to solve the issue.\n\"The person who tied the bell must untie it,\" he added.\nSeparately, Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said China and the US had \"not conducted consultations or negotiations on tariffs, let alone reached an agreement\".\nHe added that reports to the contrary were \"false\".\nTrump previously said negotiations between the countries were \"active\" - but this was also contradicted by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who said on Wednesday they had not yet begun.\nBessent added that there was an opportunity for a\"big deal\" between the US and China on trade.\nHe has previously said he expected a de-escalation of the \"unsustainable\" trade war, and said the current situation was \"not a joke\".\nTrump said on Tuesday that he would be \"very nice\" in negotiations with Beijing in the hope of securing a trade deal.\nBut following China's latest comments, he saidon his Truth Social media platform\"Boeing should default China for not taking the beautifully finished planes that China committed to purchase\".\n\"This is just a small example of what China has done to the USA, for years,\" he added, before repeating accusations that synthetic opioid fentanyl \"continues to pour into our country from China, through Mexico and Canada, killing hundreds of thousands of our people\".\nThe boss of plane manufacturer Boeing revealed Chinahad sent back aircraft it had ordered from the US as part of its retaliation to tariffs.\nKelly Ortberg said this week that two planes had already been returned and another would follow due trade tensions between the two countries.\nChina held a roundtable on Wednesday to address the concerns of more than 80 foreign firms over the impact of US tariffs on their investments and operations in China, the commerce ministry said.\n\"It is hoped that foreign firms will turn crises into opportunities,\" said Vice Commerce Minister Ling Ji."

    "section": "business",
    "summary": "The Tesla boss says he will step back from government work - but exactly when and how is unclear.",
    "content": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he will step back from his role with the Trump administration's cost-cutting team known as Doge.\nThose at the White House, including the president, have said it has long been the plan that Musk would soon step away, but the news came as the billionaire's car business saw earnings plunge.\nMusk's announcement left many unanswered questions, including when he will  actually leave the administration and what will happen to Doge, which stands for Department of Government Efficiency.\nWhen asked by the BBC on Wednesday, President Donald Trump reinforced the message that the administration was preparing for Musk's departure.\n\"We have to, at some point, let him go and do that. We expected to be doing it about this time. I'll talk to Elon about it,\" Trump said at the White House.\nThe president also said Tesla will \"be taken care of\" once Musk returns and alleged that Musk was being \"treated very unfairly, I guess, by some of the public\".\n\"He's a great patriot, and [that] should have never happened to him,\" Trump added.\nHowever, under government rules, spending fewer days at Doge could actually prolong Musk's stint in government.\nMusk has been designated a \"special government employee\" (SGE) – a label that allows him to work at a paid or unpaid government job for 130 days each year.\nAccording to a 2007Department of Justice memo, cited in an October 2024guidance documentfrom the Office of Government Ethics, any day on which an SGE performs any work for the government counts as a full day towards that limit.\nMeasured from Trump's inauguration on 20 January, the 130-day limit - assuming Musk, who brags about working weekends, clocks roughly five days a week at Doge - would run out toward the end of May.\nBut scaling back would extend that timeframe. Additionally, the 130-day limit would reset in January 2026.\nMusk has not given details on his intended schedule. He made the announcement on Tuesday, after Tesla reported financial troubles including a 71% drop in profits.\nThe drop came after repeated \"Tesla takedown\" protests across the globe and calls for boycotts against the car manufacturer amid Musk's government role. While organisers have said most protests have been peaceful, some have beendestructive with fires set at Tesla showroomsor at charging stations.\nThe company warned investors that the pain could continue, declining to offer a growth forecast while saying \"changing political sentiment\" could meaningfully hurt demand for the vehicles.\nMusk told investors on an earnings call that the time he allocates to Doge \"will drop significantly\" and that he would be \"allocating far more of my time to Tesla\".\nAfter the comments, Tesla's languishing stock price rose.\nIt's also unclear how many days Musk has already worked for the government, whether the government is keeping a tally, and how the limit would be enforced.\nThere has been criticism that the Trump administration may have flouted government rules in creating Musk's unprecedented role, and concerns that he may not follow the time limit.\nUnder rules for SGEs, Musk would have to undergo ethics training, provide a confidential financial disclosure statement, and avoid conflicts of interest.\nHis corporate empire includes large companies that do business with the US government and foreign governments, including SpaceX, which has $22 billion in US government contracts, according to the company's chief executive.\nThe rules also prohibit special government employees from partisan activities, including wearing clothing with political slogans, while in government offices or carrying out official duties. Musk has been pictured wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat in the Oval Office.\nStill, in February, an anonymous White House officialtold CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that Musk would file a confidential financial disclosure at some point, and had been given an ethics briefing.\nThe following month, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the BBC: \"Elon Musk is selflessly serving President Trump's administration as a special government employee, and he has abided by all applicable federal laws.\"\nFor now, Musk appears to serve at Trump's behest, with no clear oversight other than the president himself.\nIn a report released last week, progressive think-tank Public Citizen criticised the Trump administration and said the White House was \"wildly abusing\" the SGE rules.\n\"Right now, the public has no way to know whether SGEs like Musk who don't file public financial disclosure reports or are permitted to oversee themselves are putting the people's interests ahead of their own,\" said report author Jon Golinger.\nThe BBC has contacted Musk and the Office of Personnel Management - the agency overseeing special government employees, and one where Doge employees have reportedly taken over several functions - for comment.\nOn Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that around 100 Doge employees would remain in various government departments after Musk departs this year.\nMusk and Trump set a deadline for Doge to finish its work, which corresponds to the 250th anniversary of the signing of the US Declaration of Independence.\nThe executive order setting up Doge, signed by Trump on Inauguration Day in January, mentioned 4 July 2026 as the ending date.\nEarlier, in December, Musk responded to a tweet that also said Doge would finish entirely on that date.\n\"The final step of DOGE is to delete itself,\" he wrote."

    "summary": "An agreement has emerged as a key European demand in ongoing negotiations for a post-Brexit reset.",
    "content": "The government is no longer ruling out a youth visa deal with the EU, ahead of a summit next month to \"reset\" relations after Brexit.\nLabour has previously said it has \"no plans\" for such a scheme, which would make it easier for young people to study and work abroad.\nBut an agreement has emerged as a key European demand in ongoing negotiations between the two sides to boost co-operation. Downing Street declined to repeat its previous opposition to reporters on Thursday, saying it would not provide a \"running commentary\" on talks.\nIt comes as over 60 Labour MPs called on ministers to strike a \"new and bespoke youth visa scheme for UK and EU citizens aged under 30\".\nIn a letter to EU relations minister Nick Thomas-Symonds, they argued a mutual deal for time-limited visas, subject to a cap, would \"extend new cultural, educational, and economic opportunities to young people in the UK\".\nSir Keir Starmer met European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen later, as preparations increase for the summit in London on 19 May.\nFollowing the meeting, a Downing Street spokesperson said: \"Discussing the ongoing negotiations to strengthen the UK-EU partnership, they both agreed that good progress had been made.\n\"They asked their teams to continue their important work in the coming weeks, with the aim of delivering as ambitious a package as possible at the first UK-EU summit next month.\"\nThe Labour government is aiming to forge closer economic ties to the EU after Brexit. Both sides have also expressed a renewed interest in a defence and security pact amid the war in Ukraine.\nA defence deal would potentially unlock full UK access to a €150bn (£128bn) EU-backed loans scheme, with British firms otherwise limited to providing up to 35% of the value of projects funded under the programme.\nSpeaking at UK Trade and Business Commission meeting on Thursday, Germany's ambassador to the UK Miguel Berger said he wanted to see progress on a youth visa deal as part of a \"package approach\" to the talks, where different topics are linked together.\nHe added that EU citizens had faced \"many obstacles\" to moving to the UK since Brexit, including \"very high thresholds\" for skilled work visas.\nThe UKcurrently offers visasallowing young people from 12 non-EU countries including Japan, South Korea and Uruguay to study or work in the UK for up to two years. Those from Australia, Canada or New Zealand can extend by a further year.\nThese visas are subject to annual quotas, ranging from 100 visas for Andorra to 42,000 for Australia, with ballots held where they are oversubscribed.\nApplicants from these countries need at least £2,530 in savings, cannot apply for most benefits, and have to pay an annual NHS surcharge of £776 for students and £1,035 for workers.\nThe European Commission first suggested an EU-wide youth dealin April last year, claiming Rishi Sunak's government had approached European capitals to discuss individual visa deals, risking \"differential treatment\" of EU citizens.\nUnder its original proposal, people aged between 18 and 30 would be able to apply for visas lasting up to four years to work, study, train or volunteer, with no overall cap on the number of visas issued.\nIt also said EU applicants should not have to pay the NHS surcharge, and should be able to pay the same university tuition fees as British students, rather than the higher fees they have had to pay since Brexit.\nThere have been suggestions that the Home Office, tasked with delivering government plans to lower overall migration, is pushing for any eventual agreement to be more limited than that suggested by the European Commission.\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper is reportedly arguing for visas to be limited to one year so that EU citizens taking part do not show up in official immigration figures, with applications also subject to an overall cap.\nAsked about the reports, Mr Berger declined to comment, saying that \"we have to leave that to the negotiations\".\nThe EU has been keen to stress that a visa deal would not replicate the bloc's rules on freedom of movement, under which EU citizens were automatically entitled to live and work in the UK without applying for a visa.\nDocuments circulated between EU states also suggest a deal could be rebranded as a \"youth experience\" scheme, in an apparent bidto downplay any link to migration.\nBut any deal that is negotiated is likely to lead to a political row, with the Conservatives and Reform UK critical of a proposed agreement.\nDuring a local election campaign visit earlier, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said a deal risked \"another avenue which people might use to game the system,\" adding that Labour \"doesn't know how to negotiate\".\nShe added: \"Where are all these people they want to bring in going to work?\"\nReform leader Nigel Farage said a deal could lead to a \"huge number of people\" coming to the UK, adding it would be \"completely against what the Brexit vote demanded\".\nAn agreement has however been strongly supported by the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, which have long been calling on the Labour government to reach an agreement with the EU.\nIn his comments on Thursday, Mr Berger insisted a deal would have \"nothing to do with migration\" as those taking part in the scheme would \"go home\" once their visa has ended."

    "summary": "The finance minister drops a planned VAT increase after one party in the coalition government goes to court.",
    "content": "South Africa's finance minister has dropped plans to increase value-added tax (VAT), in a major climbdown to prevent the collapse of the coalition government.\nEnoch Godongwana's decision came after the second-biggest party, the Democratic Alliance (DA), threatened to quit the government, warning a VAT hike would hurt the poor the most.\nGodongwana, a member of President Cyril Ramaphosa's African National Congress (ANC), had argued the increase was needed as the government was facing a financial crisis.\nBut with other parties also rejecting the hike, it raised the prospect of parliament taking the unprecedented step of voting down the national budget, forcing him and the ANC to concede.\nThe climbdown is likely to be a relief for many South Africans, who are already struggling financially because of the high cost of living and an unemployment rate of 32%.\nThe ANC lost its parliamentary majority for the first time since since white-minority rule ended in 1994 in last year's elections, forcing it to share power.\nThe DA welcomed the climbdown, saying it had entered the government \"with steel spines and a clear mission: grow the economy and create jobs to rescue South Africa\".\n\"We opposed the unjust VAT hike from day one - and South Africa won,\" it said in a statement.\nThe DA had also challenged the hike in the High Court, with three judges - who heard the case - expected to give their ruling before the end of the month.\nGodongwana had proposed increasing Vat by half a percentage point, to 15.5% with effect from 1 May, saying it would help provide much-needed revenue to improve public services like education and health.\nThe ANC denied it had bowed to pressure by scrapping the increase.\nThe decision had been taken out a of \"a shared commitment across party lines that the working class, the poor, and all other people cannot be further burdened in this economic climate\", said party spokesperson Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri.\nIn a statement, the finance ministry said there would now be a need to revisit \"other expenditure decisions\" and to scrap \"measures to cushion lower income households\"  from the planned VAT hike.\nThe Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF),  the second-biggest opposition party in parliament, said South Africa had witnessed a \"budget fiasco\", and the \"incompetent\" Godongwana should resign.\nThe ANC was banking on smaller parties - especially Action SA, which was seen as the kingmaker - to gain a parliamentary majority for the budget, but it refused to budge on its demand for the increase to be dropped.\nThe hike was also opposed by the biggest trade union federation, the Congress of South African Trade Union (Cosatu), which is in alliance with the ANC.\nEven the head of the government's tax agency questioned the proposed increase, saying the last hike in 2018 did not significantly boost government revenue.\nThe crisis is likely to further damage the ANC's credibility, with opinion polls suggesting that its popularity is falling.\nAn opinion poll released earlier this month by the Institute of Race Relations put the party's support at 29.7%, while a poll in February by the Social Research Foundation put it at 32%. Both had a margin of error of around 4%.\nThe foundation said a \"significant chunk\" of ANC voters were \"so dissatisfied with the party and uncertain about their future voting intention\" that they had become \"free agents in South Africa's voting market\".\nIn last year's election, the ANC's share of the vote slumped to 40%, from 58% in the 2019 poll.\nGo toBBCAfrica.comfor more news from the African continent.\nFollow us on Twitter@BBCAfrica, on Facebook atBBC Africaor on Instagram atbbcafrica"

    "summary": "The lawsuit argues President Trump did not have the authority to enact the levies and start a global trade war",
    "content": "A dozen US states have joined together on a lawsuit aiming to block President Donald Trump's spate of tariffs that have upended global trade.\nThe suit, which is led by New York's governor and attorney general, argues that the president lacked the authority to impose the levies. It notes such tariffs must be approved by the US Congress.\nTwelve states joined the lawsuit, which was filed with the United States Court of International Trade.\nThe White House accused New York Attorney General Letitia James of \"prioritizing a witch hunt against President Trump over protecting the safety and wellbeing of their constituents\".\nWhite House spokesman Kush Desai added that the \"administration remains committed to using its full legal authority to confront the distinct national emergencies our country is currently facing—both the scourge of illegal migration and fentanyl flows across our border and the exploding annual U.S. goods trade deficit.\"\nThe lawsuit states that tariffs must be approved by Congress and questioned Trump invoking a 1970s law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to enact the levies.\n\"By claiming the authority to impose immense and ever-changing tariffs on whatever goods entering the United States he chooses, for whatever reason he finds convenient to declare an emergency, the President has upended the constitutional order and brought chaos to the American economy,\" the lawsuit states.\nTrump invoked the IEEPA as the basis for several of his tariffs against China, Mexico, Canada, and other countries.\nA president can use the law \"to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States,\" if he has first declared a national emergency.\nThe lawsuit argues that the law does not actually grant Trump the power he claims to derive from it. The act has never been used to issue tariffs by any president,congressional research shows.\nLast week, the state of Californiafiled its own lawsuitagainst the Trump administration over tariffs. That lawsuit also argues that Trump lacks the power under the IEEPA to impose these tariffs. Several other lawsuits have similarly challenged Trump's authority using that law for the levies.\nTrump has implemented tariffs on global trading partners in a stated effort to correct what he believes is a trade deficit between the US and other nations.\nOn 2 April, in an event billed as \"Liberation Day,\" Trump shook the global economy by announcing \"reciprocal\" tariffs on nations across the world. A few days later amid a market backlash, he announced a 90-day pause on the tariffs andlowered the rate to 10% for most countries.\nThat pause didn't extend to China, which Trump said had a \"lack of respect\" and was retaliating. Instead, the US issued a 145% on goods imported from China, which has led to a trade standoff and rattled global markets.\nOn Wednesday, Trump said he hoped to come to a deal with China soon and noted the 145% tariff was \"very high\".\nThe White House has also imposed 25% tariffs on certain goods from it's neighbours, Mexico and Canada."

    "section": "business",
    "summary": "From rare earths to billions in US debt, here's what China has in its arsenal - and how strong they are.",
    "content": "A trade war between the world's two biggest economies is now in full swing.\nChinese exports to the US face up to 245% tariffs, and Beijing has hit back with a 125% levy on American imports. Consumers, businesses and markets are braced for more uncertainty as fears of a global recession have heightened.\nChinese President Xi Jinping's government has repeatedly said it is open to dialogue, but warned that, if necessary, it would \"fight to the end\".\nHere's a look at what Beijing has in its arsenal to counter US President Donald Trump's tariffs.\nChina is the world's second-largest economy, which means it can absorb the impacts of the tariffs better than other smaller countries.\nWith more than a billion people, it also has a huge domestic market that could take some of the pressure off exporters who are reeling from tariffs.\nBeijing is still fumbling with the keys becauseChinese people are not spending enough. But with a range of incentives, from subsidies for household appliances to\"silver trains\"for travelling retirees, that could change.\nAnd Trump's tariffs have given the Chinese Communist Party an even stronger impetus to unlock the country's consumer potential.\nThe leadership may \"very well be willing to endure the pain to avoid capitulating to what they believe is US aggression\", Mary Lovely, a US-China trade expert at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC, told BBC Newshour earlier this month.\nChina also has a higher threshold for pain as an authoritarian regime, as it is far less worried about short-term public opinion. There is no election around the corner that will judge its leaders.\nStill, unrest is a concern, especially because there is already discontent over an ongoing property crisis and job losses.\nThe economic uncertainty over tariffs is yet another blow for young people who have only ever known a rising China.\nThe Party has been appealing to nationalist sentiments to justify its retaliatory tariffs, with state media calling on people to \"weather storms together\".\nPresident Xi Jinping may be worried but, so far, Beijing has struck a defiant and confident tone. One official assured the country: \"The sky will not fall.\"\nChina has always been known as the world's factory - but it has been pouring billions into becoming a far more advanced one.\nUnder Xi, it has been in a race with the US for tech dominance.\nIt has invested heavily in homegrown tech, from renewables to chips to AI.\nExamples include the chatbot DeepSeek, which wascelebrated as a formidable rival to ChatGPT, and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) maker. Apple has been losing its prized market share to local competitors such as Huawei and Vivo.\nRecently Beijing announced plans to spend more than $1tn over the next decade to support innovation in AI.\nUS companies have tried to move their supply chains away from China, but they have struggled to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.\nChinese manufacturers at every stage of the supply chain have given the country a decades-long advantage that will take time to replicate.\nThat unrivalled supply chain expertise and government support have made China a formidable foe in this trade war - in some ways, Beijing has been preparing for this since Trump's previous term.\nEver since Trump tariffs hit Chinese solar panels back in 2018, Beijing sped up its plans for a future beyond a US-led world order.\nIt has pumped billions into acontentious trade and infrastructure programme, better known as the Belt and Road initiative, to shore up ties with the so-called Global South.\nThe expansion of trade with South East Asia, Latin America and Africa comes as China tries to wean itself off the US.\nAmerican farmers once supplied 40% of China's soybean imports - that figure now hovers at 20%. After the last trade war, Beijing ramped up soy cultivation at home and bought record volumes of the crop from Brazil, which is now its largest soybean supplier.\n\"The tactic kills two birds with one stone. It deprives America's farm belt of a once‑captive market and burnishes China's food security credentials,\" says Marina Yue Zhang, associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney's Australia-China Relations Institute.\nThe US is no longer China's biggest export market: that spot now belongs to South East Asia. In fact China was the largest trading partner for 60 countries in 2023 - nearly twice as many as the US. The world's biggest exporter, it made a record surplus of $1tn at the end of 2024.\nThat doesn't mean the US, the world's biggest economy, is not a crucial trading partner for China. But it does mean it's not going to be easy for Washington to back  China into a corner.\nFollowing reports that the White House will use bilateral trade negotiations to isolate China, Beijing has warned countries against\"reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests\".\nThat would be animpossible choicefor much of the world\n\"We can't choose, and we will never choose [between China and the US],\" Malaysia's trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told the BBC last week.\nTrump held firm as stocks plummeted following his sweeping tariffs announcement in early April, likening his staggering levies to \"medicine\".\nBut he made a U-turn, pausing most of those tariffs for 90 days after a sharp sell-off in US government bonds. Also known as Treasuries, these have long been seen as a safe investment. But the trade war has shaken confidence in the assets.\nTrump has since hinted at a de-escalation in trade tensions with China, saying that the tariffs on Chinese goods will \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".\nSo, experts point out, Beijing now knows that the bond market can rattle Trump.\nChina also holds $700bn in US government bonds. Japan, a staunch American ally, is the only non-US holder to own more than that.\nSome argue that this gives Beijing leverage: Chinese media has regularly floated the idea of selling or withholding purchases of US bonds as a \"weapon\".\nBut experts warn that China will not emerge unscathed from such a situation.\nRather, it will lead to huge losses for Beijing's investments in the bond market and destabilise the Chinese yuan.\nChina will only be able to exert pressure with US government bonds \"only up to a point\", Dr Zhang says. \"China holds a bargaining chip, not a financial weapon.\"\nWhat China can weaponise, however, is its near monopoly in extracting and refining rare earths, a range of elements important to advanced tech manufacturing.\nChina has huge deposits of these, such as dysprosium, which is used in magnets in electric vehicles and wind turbines, and Yttrium, which provides heat-resistant coating for jet engines.\nBeijing has already responded to Trump's latest tariffs by restricting exports of seven rare earths, including some that are essential for making AI chips.\nChina accounts for about 61% of rare earths production and 92% of their refining, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency (IEA).\nWhile Australia, Japan and Vietnam have begun mining for rare earths, it will take years before China can be cut out of the supply chain.\nIn 2024, China banned the export of another critical mineral, antimony, that is crucial to various manufacturing processes. Its price more than doubled amid a wave of panic buying and a search for alternative suppliers.\nThe fear is that the same can happen to the rare earths market, which would severely disrupt various industries from electric vehicles to defence.\n\"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" Thomas Kruemmer, director of Ginger International Trade and Investment,told the BBCpreviously.\n\"The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial.\""

The country knows it needs to change. Everyone knows it needs to change. And we want to help it change because we need rebalancing too,\" he said.\nThe comments come as the trade war between the world's two biggest economies has escalated in recent weeks.\nUS President Donald Trump has brought in a number of tariffs on imports to the US which he has said are aimed at increasing US manufacturing and protecting jobs.\nThese include import taxes of up to 145% on Chinese goods, but China has hit back with a 125% tax on US products.\nSpeaking at the Institute of International Finance conference on Wednesday, Bessent, said it was a \"matter of impetus and will\".\n\"There is an opportunity for a big deal here, that the US is looking to rebalance to more manufacturing, the identity of that would be less consumption.\n\"If China is serious on less dependence on export-led manufacturing growth, and a rebalancing towards a domestic economy… if they want to rebalance, let's do it together.\"\nThe comments come after Bessent reportedly said on Tuesday that heexpected a de-escalation of the trade warand that the current situation was \"not a joke\".\nTrump has also said he is optimistic about improving trade relations with China, saying the level of tariffs - or import taxes - that he had imposed on Chinese imports would \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".\nTensions between China and the US have shaken investors, with violent swings in share prices and sharp falls in the dollar.\nStocks surged on Wednesday on hopes that trade tensions between the US and China could soon ease.\nAside from the trade war, Bessent called on the IMF and the World Bank to refocus on the core missions of economic stability and development, arguing that they had strayed too far into vanity projects such as \"climate change, gender and social issue\".\n\"These issues are not the IMF's mission,\" he said.\nTensions between the countries have rattled financial markets, with both sides introducing strong tariffs on each other.\nBank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said that he was \"very frankly encouraged\" by Bessent's comments on the IMF and World Bank.\nAlthough Mr Bessent said the IMF and the World Bank are \"falling short\" he did not call for the US to withdraw from the institutions as some conservatives have lobbied for.\nHe said the Trump administration will use US influence at these institutions and \"push them to accomplish their important mandates\"."

    "summary": "UK retailers argue that cheap foreign rivals are undercutting business using a tax-free status on small parcels.",
    "content": "Major retailers have welcomed the government's review of a rule that allows small parcels to enter the UK duty-free, saying it gives overseas firms such as Shein and Temu an unfair advantage over British businesses.\nThe current rule allows international retailers to send packages to the UK worth less than £135 without incurring import taxes.\nFormer Dragons' Den star Theo Paphitis, whose retail group includes the Ryman and Robert Dyas, told the BBC that the measure was ruining UK High Streets.\nSome retailers have argued that they are being undercut by overseas rivals, but a body representing small businesses said scrapping the exemption could raise costs for them and prices for customers.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves announced on Wednesday that the government planned to review the customs treatment of low-value products entering the UK following complaints from retailers.\nThe explosion of parcels being shipped under the measure has prompted increased scrutiny in recent years. While all retailers use the exemption, those who sell fast-fashion and cheap goods have seen sales soar.\nIt has fuelled the rise of Chinese retailers, such as online giants Shein and Temu, which ship low-value packages to the UK and other countries to reach millions of customers.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Paphitis said retailers had been lobbying government \"for a very, very long time\", arguing the rule had a devastating impact \"on our retail landscape and our high streets\".\nHe joined the bosses of Sainsbury's, Currys and the British Retail Consortium in welcoming the government's consultation on the rule.\nUK businesses bringing in larger shipments have to pay taxes, and they also argue that cheaper goods might fail to meet the same environmental and ethical standards that they have to keep to.\nAside from concerns over unfair competition with domestic retailers, it has also been raised that governments could be missing out on potential tax income.\nThe so-called \"de minimis\" rule has received renewed interest after US President Donald Trump scrapped a similar measure amid his escalating trade war with China.\nGoods worth less than $800 moving into the US will soon be subject to charges, when they were previously exempt. The move has already prompted Chinese retailers to raise their prices.\nIn the UK, there are further concerns that China will dump goods here to avoid the tariffs which Trump has imposed on its exports.\nEarlier this month, the boss of Currystold the Financial Timesthat the \"single biggest area where lots of stock is likely to land in the UK... is from the likes of Shein, Temu, Alibaba, TikTok shop and, most of all, Amazon marketplace\".\nOn Thursday, Alex Baldock told the BBC that he was pleased the government was \"reviewing the low-value shipment loophole, and that they're committed to levelling the playing field between British and overseas retailers\".\nBut the Federation of Small Businesses urged the government to proceed with caution in its de minimis consultation, suggesting that scrapping it might \"ultimately lead to higher prices for consumers\".\n\"With 16% of goods moved by small firms sitting below the £135 threshold, a decision to scrap it impacts on trading and inflation,\" said Tina McKenzie, chair of the FSB.\n\"It's right to be concerned about potential future dumping of goods, as escalating tariffs applied by bigger global blocs against each other may mean a surge in goods arriving in markets like our own,\" she added.\nMr Paphitis told the BBC it was \"absolute nonsense\" that the measure kept inflation and prices down, arguing it led to a loss of jobs and tax revenue for the UK, due to businesses being unable to compete with cheaper foreign rivals.\nHelen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, the trade body for retailers, said the review was \"more critical now\" due to a \"rise in the number of potentially non-compliant products entering the UK market\".\nThe British Independent Retailers Association said small packages having no tax or charges was a key concern. It called on ministers to act to \"deter import surges\" in order to \"protect independent retailers\".\nWhen Sainsbury's announced their latest financial results earlier this month, boss Simon Roberts called on the government to act as soon as possible.\n\"Everyone should pay their tax... So if there's a loophole here which means that's not happening, then that needs to be closed so it's a level playing field for everybody,\" he said."

And we want to build on the relationship that we have,\" she added later speaking at a Semafor event.\nSome US officials have been positive about the prospects of a deal. Last week US Vice-President JD Vance said there was a \"good chance\" a trade deal could be reached with the UK.\nSpeaking to the BBC at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) event on Wednesday, Reeves said the UK was \"not going to rush into a deal\".\nBut she said the government was \"confident that working with our partners in the US we can get a better trading relationship and build on the substantial trade that already exists between our two great countries\".\n\"We want to get the right deal for Britain, to better support our industry, our jobs and consumers,\" she added.\nReeves said that the UK had been \"really clear\" in discussions with US negotiators \"that we're not going to be reducing agricultural standards in the UK\".\n\"The US administration respect and understand that we have high standards to support British farming, and to support British consumers, and we're not going to be relaxing those standards,\" she said.\nMany American farmers use growth hormones as a standard part of their beef production, something that was banned in the UK and the European Union in the 1980s.\nThe US has previously pushed for a relaxation of rules for its agricultural products, including beef from cattle that have been given growth hormones.\nFarmers in the UK warned ministers last week not to dilute British food standards, saying the use of hormones in rearing livestock cannot be accepted.\nShadow chancellor Mel Stride said the Conservatives would \"expect\" Reeves to stick to agricultural standards \"but let's see the detail as and when there is a deal\".\nHe said it is \"hugely important\" to \"get these 25% tariffs on cars and steel down\" but he said the government should be moving faster on negotiations.\n\"It's taken them a long time, in fact, to even have got in the room with the US administration to start discussing these issues, let alone getting a deal now,\" he said.\nTrump has brought in a large number of tariffs on imports to the US, arguing they will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs.\nThese include, as part of an ongoing trade war, levies of up to 145% on Chinese goods. China has hit back with a 125% tax on US products.\nThe move has rattled the world economy, sparking turmoil on global financial markets.\nPrices are expected to rise for consumers in the US as a result of the tariffs, due to the companies importing goods passing on higher costs.\nThe IMF has cut its global growth forecast because of the uncertainty caused by tariffs, and says it expects US growth to be hit the hardest.\nOn Wednesday, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said the UK must take the risk of trade wars hitting global economic growth \"very seriously\".\nHowever, Reeves said: \"I do understand the concerns the US has about countries around the world that run large and persistent trade surpluses with the US.\"\nShe said the UK \"is not one of those countries\" so \"there is a deal there to be done between the UK and the US\".\nShe added that she understood \"the need to rebalance the global economy\".\nThis, in part, is why the UK announced on Wednesday a review of low-value imports coming into the UK which are \"undercutting the British High Street and British retailers\" she said.\nThis mirrors a US action, with the White House set to clamp down on deliveries under $800 - specifically those sent from China and Hong Kong - on 2 May.\nIt is set to close a loophole allowing low-value packages to enter the US without incurring any duties.\nThe removal of the so-called \"de minimis\" rule will hit companies including fast-fashion firm Shein and Temu, the low-cost retail giant.\nShein and Temu have both warned that they will increase prices \"due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs\".\nThe UK government said that the UK Trade Remedies Authority (TRA) would be putting more resources into helping firms report unfair trade practices as part of its review."

the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service,\" it said in a statement.\nThe fines are relatively small given the tech companies' huge worldwide revenues - and are a fraction ofGoogle's €2.4bn finefrom last September.\nBut they are significant in the context of the current global economic situation.\nIn February, Donald Trump's White House issueda memorandumcomplaining about EU and UK regulation of American tech firms.\n\"Today's decisions are important in that they confirm that the European Commission will not back down,\" Anne Witt, professor of law at the EDHEC Business School in France, told the BBC.\nProf Witt said the disagreement was \"not so much about substantive antitrust principles,\" given the US government is itself takinga number of big tech companies to courtover alleged monopoly power.\nThey are more \"about the fact that European institutions are telling US companies how to behave, even if these decisions are limited to have these companies behave on European soil,\" she added.\nOne company pleased with the ruling against Apple is Epic Games, the makers of Fortnite.\nThey had along-running disputeover the distribution of their apps on Apple devices.\nEpic Games chief executive Tim Sweeney said the ruling was \"great news for app developers worldwide\" ina thread on X.\nHe urged the US to pass similar legislation which would allow developers to distribute their apps without using Apple's App Store, which charges fees for using its platform.\nA US-based think tank, which is partly funded by big tech firms including Apple and Meta, came out against the decision.\nThe Information Technology and Innovation Foundation said the European Commission \"has made clear that the DMA will be used to extract revenues from U.S. firms even as they continue striving to comply with its strictures.\"\n\"The Commission's actions today will not be well received by the Trump administration,\" it said.\nThe UK is also investigating big tech companies over alleged monopoly power, after adigital competition lawwas brought in last year focusing on companies with large market shares.\n\"Apple and Google's mobile ecosystems andGoogle's general searchand search advertising services are currently being investigated for potentially having this status, and it is likely that other US tech giants and platforms will face similar investigations in the near future,\" said Andrew Maxwell, partner at law firm Freeths."

    "summary": "In April 2020, Indonesian photographer Joshua Irwandi captured one of the most chilling and poignant images of the pandemic.",
    "content": "In April 2020, Indonesian photographer Joshua Irwandi captured one of the most chilling and poignant images of Covid-19's toll.\nCovid-19 was first confirmed in Indonesia on 2 March 2020 – a dance instructor and her mother tested positive after coming into contact with someone with the virus.\nIndonesia is a vast country made up of thousands of islands, but it took little more than a month for the disease to spread to every one of its 34 provinces, among them Java.\nJava is the most heavily populated island in the world, home to more than151 million people. As the pandemic spread, Java – and its densely packed capital Jakarta – became an epicentre of the disease's spread.\nIndonesia's health workers battled this new disease with scant resources at first. One study estimated that by July 2021,more than 1,500 Indonesia health workers had been killed by the disease. Nurses in the densely populated country reportedshortages of personal protective equipment (PPE)in the early stages of the pandemic as they dealt with the increasing caseload.\nIndonesia, of course, was not facing this disease alone. As part of a series looking at the global response to the virus in April 2020, National Geographic commissioned Indonesian photographerJoshua Irwandito cover his country's battle against Covid.\nClad in a protective suit like the health workers he was shadowing, Irwandi spent his days inside a Jakarta hospital, observing firsthand how health workers were trying to save lives.\nThey were not always successful. One victim – the patient's identity has never been revealed to the public – died in their hospital bed. Irwandi took a picture after the body had been wrapped in protective coverings to prevent infection.\n\"This is the procedure that that was mandated by the Indonesian Ministry of Health,\" says Irwandi. \"How to, you know, dispose of the bodies, you have to wrap them. What happened that day was I was shadowing the doctors and nurses in the hospital, and I was informed that there was a patient who just passed away.\"\nIrwandi first took pictures of the nurses, clad head-to-toe in protective gear, covering the body in whatever material they had to hand. \"First with infectious waste bags, actually, and after the body was sort of wrapped up they'd start wrapping with plastic wrap that you see in the supermarket,\" he says. \"I think it took a gruelling hour or so in the heat. They thought that if we turn off the air conditioner, then it might kill the virus. And you're operating under this hot mask.\"\nIrwandi's calm but chilling photograph belies the frenzied activity that was taking place hospitals as Covid-19 struck. The plastic wrap catches the cold, hard glare from the ceiling lights, while the coverings underneath look like something that could have wrapped a body in a ceremonial funeral thousands of years ago.\nThis eerie figure lies in stark contrast to the modern-day setting: an anonymous hospital room, empty except for a bed and television set. With its sombre, painterly quality, it reminds us that even in our industrialised, often antiseptic modern world, we remain vulnerable.\n\"The whole time I worked with my mentor here in Indonesia, Geert Van Castelren, who's a Dutch photographer. I was also showing him what kind of images I've been making, asking him 'where do you think this is going'. If you're talking about composition, the more that it resembles something from the classics, usually the stronger the impact of the photograph would make.\"\nAnd make an impact Irwandi's photo did. \"A lot of people accused the image of a set-up,\" says Irwandi. \"There was a singer with two million followers who basically thought that this is a whole setup, and Covid is not that dangerous. People said that it's a mannequin inside.\n\"You can imagine the sort of misinformation and disinformation at the time. I was given access for a very specific job. Obviously, it's very different to what the public might be seeing or feeling.\"\nIrwandi took a conscious decision to take the photo from the same height as the body: it is not the top-down view that a health worker or doctor would have when attending to the body. This positioning puts both the viewer and the subject at the same level.\n\"When I was in that moment photographing somebody being wrapped in plastic. Could it be my family next? Could it be my friends next? The best you can do is inform your loved ones that this is happening, and take care of yourself,\" Irwandi says. \"I think that is the main message from the photo: if you don't put on your mask, or if you reject science, this is potentially how people could end up.\"\nThe image drew reaction far from Indonesia. It was given second prize in the general news category of the World Press Photo in 2021 and was also nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.\nAmid the social media-fuelled furore around the image, people continued to contract the disease and die. By the end of the year, more than 800,000 cases had been confirmed in Indonesia and more than 20,000 people had died.\nMore like this:\n•Five years on: The countries that never locked down\n•When empty became the new normal\n•The heat-showing shape of things to come\n\"It wasn't the first patient who died that I photographed, and it's not the last either,\" says Irwandi. \"The following year, you know, Jakarta becamethe epicentre of Covid in Asia. You could imagine, how many people were influenced by those who thought that Covid was not dangerous, or who thought that 'this is all a set-up, this is fake news', or whatever, and those people died anyway.\nIrwandi said the photo had extra resonance for him when he covered mass burials of Covid victims in a graveyard a year later. He visited twice within a week, and fresh plots had already been dug for more victims. \"The danger is real, whether or not people like the photograph,\" he says.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62jxdxng7do",
    "section": "innovation",
    "summary": "Humanoid robots are attracting a lot of investment but will China dominate the industry?",
    "content": "It's a bright spring morning in Hanover, Germany, and I'm on my way to meet a robot.\nI have been invited to see the G1, a humanoid robot built by Chinese firm, Unitree, at the Hannover Messe, one of the world's largest industrial trade shows.\nStanding at about 4'3\" (130cm), G1 is smaller and more affordable than other humanoid robots on the market, and has such a highly fluid range of motion and dexterity that videos of it performing dance numbers andmartial arts have gone viral.\nToday the G1 is being controlled remotely by Pedro Zheng, the Unitree sales manager.\nHe explains that customers must program each G1 for autonomous functions.\nPassers-by stop and actively try to engage with the G1, which cannot be said for a lot of the other machines being shown off in the cavernous conference room.\nThey reach out to shake its hand, make sudden movements to see if it will respond, they laugh when G1 waves or bends backwards, they apologise if they bump into it. There's something about its human shape that, uncanny as it is, sets people at ease.\nUnitree is just one of dozens of companies around the world developing robots that have a human form.\nThe potential is huge - for business it promises a workforce that doesn't need holidays or pay rises.\nIt could also be the ultimate domestic appliance. After all, who wouldn't want a machine that could do the laundry and stack the dishwasher.\nBut the technology is still some way off. While robotic arms and mobile robots have been common in factories and warehouses for decades, conditions in those workplaces can be controlled and workers can be kept safe.\nIntroducing a humanoid robot to a less predictable environment, like a restaurant or a home, is a much more difficult problem.\nTo be useful humanoid robots would have to be strong, but that also makes them potentially dangerous - simply falling over at the wrong time could be hazardous.\nSo much work needs to be done on the artificial intelligence that would control such a machine.\n\"The AI simply has not yet reached a breakthrough moment,\" a Unitree spokesperson tells the BBC.\n\"Today's robot AI finds basic logic and reasoning – such as for understanding and completing complex tasks in a logical way – a challenge,\" they said.\nAt the moment their G1 is marketed at research institutions and tech companies, who can use Unitree's open source software for development.\nFor now entrepreneurs are focussing their efforts on humanoid robots for warehouses and factories.\nThe highest profile of those is Elon Musk. His car company, Tesla, is developing a humanoid robot called Optimus.In January he saidthat \"several thousand\" will be built this year and he expects them to be doing \"useful things\" in Tesla factories.\nOther carmakers are following a similar path. BMWrecently introduced humanoid robotsto a US factory. Meanwhile, South Korean car firm Hyundaihas ordered tens of thousandsof robots from Boston Dynamics, the robot firm it bought in 2021.\nThomas Andersson, founder of research firm STIQ, tracks 49 companies developing humanoid robots - those with two arms and legs. If you broaden the definition to robots with two arms, but propel themselves on wheels, then he looks at more than 100 firms.\nMr Andersson thinks that Chinese companies are likely to dominate the market.\n\"The supply chain and the entire ecosystem for robotics is huge in China, and it's really easy to iterate developments and do R&D [research and development],\" he says.\nUnitree underlines that advantage - its G1 is cheap (for a robot) with an advertised price of $16,000 (£12,500).\nAlso, Mr Andersson points out, the investment favours Asian nations.\nIn a recent report STIQ notesthat almost 60% of all funding for humanoid robots has been raised in Asia, with the US attracting most of the rest.\nChinese companies have the added benefit of support from the national and local government.\nFor example, in Shanghai there isa state-backed training facilityfor robots, where dozens of humanoid robots are learning to complete tasks.\nSo how can US and European robot makers compete with that?\nBristol-based Bren Pierce has founded three robotics companies and the latest, Kinisi has just launched the KR1 robot.\nWhile the robot has been designed and developed in the UK, it will be manufactured in Asia.\n\"The problem you get as a European or American company, you have to buy all these sub-components from China in the first place.\n\"So then it becomes stupid to buy your motors, buy your batteries, buy your resistors, shift them all halfway around the world to put together when you could just put them all together at the source, which is in Asia.\"\nAs well as making his robots in Asia, Mr Pierce is keeping costs down by not going for the full humanoid form.\nDesigned for warehouses and factories, the KR1 does not have legs.\n\"All of these places have flat floors. Why would you want the added expense of a very complex form factor... when you could just put it on a mobile base?\" he asks.\nWhere possible, his KR1 is built with mass-produced components - the wheels are the same as you would find on an electric scooter.\n\"My philosophy is buy as many things as you can off the shelf. So all our motors, batteries, computers, cameras, they're all commercially available, mass produced parts,\" he says.\nLike his competitors at Unitree, Mr Pierce says that the real \"secret sauce\" is the software that allows the robot to work with humans.\n\"A lot of companies come out with very high-tech robots, but then you start needing a PhD in robotics to be able to actually install it and use it.\n\"What we're trying to design is a very simple to use robot where your average warehouse or factory worker can actually learn how to use it in a couple of hours,\" Mr Pierce says.\nHe says the KR1 can perform a task after being guided through it by a human 20 or 30 times.\nThe KR1 will be given to pilot customers to test this year.\nSo will robots ever break out of factories into the home? Even the optimistic Mr Pierce says it's a long way off.\n\"My long term dream for the last 20 years has been building the everything robot. This is what I was doing my PhD work in I do think that is the end goal, but it's a very complicated task,\" says Mr Pierce.\n\"I still think eventually they will be there, but I think that's at least 10 to 15 years away.\""

    "summary": "Just a few years ago, Chris Brookes-Smith could have died from eating peanuts - but taking part in a clinical trial has changed his life.",
    "content": "Chris Brookes-Smith, 28, used to live in fear of dying from eating even the smallest trace of peanut.\nTen years ago he had his worst allergic reaction after ordering a curry at a local Indian takeaway. The trauma of it is seared into his memory.\n\"I knew I was in trouble after one bite,\" he says. \"Within seconds there were spots on my lips. Within minutes I was vomiting. I could feel my throat closing up, hives forming in my armpits then over my whole body... My face going all puffy with the swelling.\"\nHis voice tails off, full of emotion.\n\"I thought I was going to die.\"\nPhotos taken in hospital later that day show the toll the reaction took on his body.\n\"I looked like a plucked turkey because my skin had blistered so much,\" Chris says.\nBut the most painful thing were the hives - red, raised bumps on the skin - which felt \"like boiling water had been poured over me\".\nTrying to avoid peanuts, one of the most common food allergies, has been a way of life for Chris and millions of other adults with a serious allergy. Eating out, going to social events and travelling abroad are all fraught with anxiety.\nAs many as one in 200 adults and one in 50 children have a nut allergy, charities say. Some children grow out of their allergies, but many don't - and they continue into adulthood, often getting worse.\nAn allergic reaction occurs when the body reacts to the protein in peanuts, thinking it's a threat, which triggers a sudden release of chemicals.Symptoms can range from the mild to very serious.\nChris's allergy first came to light as a baby, when he developed a rash as his mum made peanut butter sandwiches.\nEach reaction since has been worse than the one before, which means he's become accustomed to living every day \"on high alert hoping nothing bad happens\".\nActivities such as going out with friends or eating in restaurants, which should be enjoyable, turned into stressful, potentially life-threatening experiences.\nDespite a love of travel, Chris avoided going to countries where peanuts are commonly used, like south east Asia, after three allergic reactions on a trip to Italy.\nAs Chris grew up, his family constantly worried about him. But then his mum heard about a clinical trial at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London that would change her son's life.\nIt would test whether adults like Chris with serious peanut allergies could be desensitised by training their bodies to tolerate the very thing that could kill it, calming down the immune system when it would usually over-react.\nDespite being \"really nervous\", Chris agreed to sign up.\nUnder the watchful eye of doctors, Chris started by eating a fraction of a milligram of peanut powder mixed with yoghurt. Over many months, the amount of peanut was gradually increased, slowly building up to Chris eating fractions of nuts and, finally, whole nuts.\nBy the end of the nine-month study, 14 of the 21 patients could eat the equivalent of five peanuts without having allergic reactions - including Chris.\nProfessor Stephen Till, who led the research, says the treatment \"has potential to have a real impact on patients' lives\".\n\"Most severe reactions occur because of mistakes, usually by somebody else, and miscommunication. So it provides them with some protection against that.\n\"They've taken control, if you like, of their peanut allergy now.\"\nThe method - called oral immunotherapy - is already proven to work for allergies to pollen, wasp and bee stings. It's only been used on food allergies in the last 20 years, and mostlyin childrenwhose immune systems are still developing. Adult allergies are thought to be harder to shift.\n\"Peanut allergy is very common in children and almost never goes away,\" says Prof Till. \"Those young people are going to become adults, so we need treatments for adults too.\"\nThis trial, published in the journal Allergy,shows adults with serious allergies can increase the amount of peanut they can tolerate by 100 times.\nChris, who lives in Northamptonshire, had no idea how he would react to even the slightest trace of peanut. Increasing that dose - willingly - every day was something he couldn't imagine.\n\"The first time I went there and I ingest this stuff, my heart's going a million miles an hour,\" he says. \"The big jump in fear was going from peanut dust to half a whole nut.\"\nBut he was reassured by having a team of doctors and nurses present, with drugs such as adrenaline standing by in case of a severe, life-threatening reaction.\n\"You've got 100 eyes on you - nothing is gonna happen.\"\nHowever, experts stress no one should try this at home on their own because of the risk of a serious allergic reaction occurring.\nNot everyone who tried the treatment was desensitised, and larger trials in more people will have to work out why that is.\n\"For some people, there were reactions and we had to slow down or go back a step,\" explains Prof Till. \"But the message is that you can desensitise adults to peanuts -and there should be more focus on adults in the future.\"\nBeing able to eat peanuts safely had a huge impact on the lives of those who took part, the researchers say. It has given them freedom to travel, reduced their anxiety when eating out and removed their fear of food.\nHow to develop this into a practical treatment on the NHS is more of a challenge. First, larger trials are needed to prove it can work for more people.\nAnd researchers are looking at whether putting drops of peanut in solution under the tongue could be a safer way of achieving the same end result.\nChris now eats four peanuts every morning with his breakfast granola to keep his allergy at bay – as recommended by his doctors.\nHe's grateful for having had the opportunity to take part in the trial and hopes many others with serious peanut allergies can also benefit from the treatment.\nWhile he admits he still hates the flavour of peanuts, he says knowing he can now eat something that once sent his body into \"nuclear meltdown\" has changed his life.\n\"It's a wonderful feeling,\" Chris says. \"I'm no longer afraid of dying.\"\nSign up hereto receive our weekly newsletter highlighting uplifting stories and remarkable people from around the world."

    "content": "There's a secret side of YouTube, just beyond the guiding hand of the algorithm – and it’s nothing like what you know. The vast majority of YouTube's estimated 14.8 billion videos have almost never been seen. Until now.\nOn 23 April 2005, YouTube posted its first video; 19 awkward seconds of the platform's co-founder describing elephants at the zoo. But 20 years later, YouTube has moved from its amateur roots to such a behemoth that the company says it's thenew Hollywood. YouTube is the world'snumber one TV streaming service, where users clock billions of hours of watching every day. Leading YouTubers regularly outperform big-name studios. For comparison, anestimated823 million cinema tickets were sold across all of the US and Canada in 2024. Meanwhile, MrBeast's most successful video alone racked up 762 million views, about one watch for every 10 people on earth.\nThat's the vision of YouTube the companypromotes– slick, professional, entertaining and loud – but from one perspective, it's all a façade.\nThrough another lens, the essence of YouTube is more like thisvideo from 2020. Before I watched, it had only been seen twice. A man points the camera out of his bedroom window as a flurry breaks out in the dead of winter. \"Here it is,\" he says. \"The falling snow.\" The sound of a TV plays in the background. A bird lands on a nearby fence. 19 minutes go by. Nothing happens.\n\"The conversations we're having about YouTube are based on an impoverished view of what the platform really is,\" says Ryan McGrady, senior researcher at the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, US. \"When we just focus on what's popular, we miss how the vast majority of people actually use YouTube as uploaders, and overlooking the role it plays in our society.\"\nI spent the last month dipping into one of the firsttruly random samplesof YouTube ever collected outside the company. I saw a side of the internet that sometimes feels lost, one full of pure, unvarnished self-expression. It's an entire world that YouTube's all-seeing algorithm won't show you.\n\"YouTube isn't just a vehicle for professionals,\" McGrady says. \"We rely on it as the default video arm of the internet. YouTube is infrastructure. It's a critical tool that regular people use to communicate.\"\nTo unveil this side of YouTube, McGrady and his colleagues built atool that dials videos at random. The scraper tried more than 18 trillion potential URLs before it collected a big enough sample forreal scientific analysis. Among the findings, the researchers estimate that the median video has been watchedjust 41 times. Posts with more than 130 views are actually in the top third of the service's most popular content. In other words, the vast majority of YouTube is practically invisible.\nMost of these videos aren't meant for us to see. They exist because people need a digital attic to store their memories. It's an internet unshaped by the pressures of clicks and algorithms – a glimpse into a place where content doesn't have to perform, where it can simply exist.\n12 years ago, a woman from the US named Emily posted a YouTube video called \"sw33t tats\". I learned it's even older than that, recorded around 2008. In the video, Emily, who asked to withhold her full name, sits in her college dorm room. She pries her mouth open as her younger sister brings a marker to the inside of Emily's lower lip.\n\"Stop moving!\", her sister yells as she starts to write, the girls barely able to control their laughter. Emily holds her lip open to the camera, and her sister does the same, revealing a sweet tat of her own. But the footage is blurry; whatever these fake tattoos said is lost to time.\nEmily, now 34 and living in New York City, forgot this video existed until I asked her about it. \"I don't even remember why I uploaded this,\" she says. \"I think wanted to send it to my sister, but I also I had to free up space on my hard drive. I just needed a place to put it. I don't know, it's funny and weird. I'm glad it's still here.\"\n\"We tend to assume the reason to use social media is to try to be an influencer, either you're Joe Rogan or you're a failure. But that's the wrong way to think about it,\" says Ethan Zuckerman, who leads the YouTube research as the director of the University of Massachusetts' Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure.\nYouTube tells the BBC it's incorrect to suggest the platform doesn't let you see videos with low views or content from small channels. The algorithm's job is to help people find the videos they want to watch and that will give them value, YouTube says, and sometimes that does include videos with a small number of views.\n\"The magic of YouTube is that whether a video has 60 views or six million, people are able to find community, learn a new skill, be entertained, or share their voice with the world,\" says Boot Bullwinkle, a YouTube spokesperson. \"Every channel starts from the same blank slate, from which they can build an audience and grow a business.\"\nZuckerman and his colleagues weren't the first to go looking for YouTube's underbelly. Between 2009 and 2012, for instance, iPhones included a feature that let users post videos straight to YouTube with a few taps. YouTube reported that mobile uploadsjumped 400%a day. Unless people added a custom title, the name for all these videos followed a standard format, which makes them easily searchable over a decade later. A few online tinkerers haveexplored these videos, which apparently number in the millions. One even built acustom playerthat cycles through them.\nWithout the algorithm's recommendations, you'll find that YouTube is a study of the everyday, Zuckerman says, people documenting small moments in their lives and using the available tools to exchange ideas.\nIn South Asia, for example, Zuckerman says YouTube and similar networks seem to function as a video messaging tool for people with low or no literacy. Most of YouTube comes from outside of the US, in fact. Zuckerman's lab has estimated thatover 70% of YouTubevideos are in languages other than English. You find fisherman in South America waving from a boat, or two construction workers speaking in Hindi about how much they miss home. Videos like these fall under what he calls \"friends and family\" content, where comments and interactions all come from people who seem to know the user personally.\n\"If any of these videos went viral, it would mean something went terribly wrong. That's not what most of YouTube for,\" Zuckerman says.\nMost unwatched YouTube is less entertaining than sw33t tats, which, with respect to Emily, sets a low bar. This stuff is bland enough to melt your brain. A bride gets ready for a photo shoot. A grouchy Korean man rants about politics. Six seconds of a martial arts instructor, devoid of context. Dash camera footage from a car struggling to escape a parking lot. A woman advertises a horse for sale in 2018. Endless, mundane screen recordings of video games – the University of Massachusetts Amhurststudy foundpeople playing video games seems to make up almost 20% of YouTube.\nOccasionally, you stumble on something fun, or more often, just plain weird. Three men performatively slapping each other's rear ends to a James Brown song. A woman reviews a brand of pre-sliced bologna (it's \"not too bad\"). Or take the channel \"Space Stuff and Other Stuff\", where a kidraps about the planet Neptuneand shares hiscondolencesafter Queen Elizabeth's passing. The latter falls in the \"other stuff\" category, apparently.\nSome videos are heartrending. I listened to an elderly man describe how he's living in a car on a farm, trading manual labour for a place to stay. There was a movingtribute to a departed catfrom her owner, Tyler. \"Kiko didn't make it,\" he says, holding back tears. \"It's so darn quiet without her here.\" A few dozen videos I paused to watch a young ballerina float delicately across a stage, wafting back and forth in front of a hushed crowd.\n\"As researchers, we spend a lot of time with this stuff. It can be a lot like looking at people's personal snapshots,\" Zuckerman says. \"Most of it's boring, but sometimes it's poignant, even haunting. And every so often, you get something that feels incredibly revealing about how human beings communicate.\"\nBut my favourite videos by far came from Bill \"The WoofDriver\" Hellman. He's a 58-year-old working in real estate just outside of Baltimore, US. But that's not his passion. What Hellman really cares about is his dogs, and the unique way he cares for them. \"You've never seen anything like this before,\" he says inone video. I guarantee that he's right.\nHellman has built over 50 custom-made vehicles that he uses to take his four huskies out for what he calls \"urban mushing\". He uses social media to document their adventures on the trails of the eastern US. It all looks a bit like the dog sled races of theIditarod. Except here, the dogs are usually strapped to the side of his various slow-moving contraptions, recumbent bicycles and electric dog-walking carts. By the looks of it Hellman's dogs are thrilled to participate.\nHe's posted more than 2,400 YouTube videos in the last 14 years, many of which includeoriginal rock songs. (Hellman says he's written more than 100 WoofDriver songs, in fact.) He puts in a lot of work, heading out with drones and groups of friends to document his journeys. Hellman's even paid for celebrity endorsements through the platformCameoto promote his videos. But for all the effort, his channel often gets little traction. Many videos have views in the low double digits.\n\"I don't get a big audience a lot of the time, but that doesn't bother me. I was just so in love with how happy it made the dogs that at some point I thought 'I gotta share this',\" Hellman says. \"Maybe it'll inspire someone to take better care of their dogs, but really, I use YouTube like the cloud, so I have a place to document my adventures.\"\nYouTube doesn't pay the bills, and the WoofDriver isn't selling anything – though he's happy to give you the dimensions if you want to build your own urban dog sled. \"I just do it because of the joy it brings me,\" Hellman says.\nRandom YouTube usually doesn't look like the highly produced videos of the WoofDriver, but he's a good representation in one sense. Like Hellman's content, the majority of these unseen YouTube videos range from neutral to overwhelmingly positive.\nThe same can't be said for what rises to the top.Researchsuggests YouTube's algorithmamplifies negativity, reinforcesstereotypesand gives users little control over the contentthey don't want to see. Over the years, YouTube has faced increasing criticism over concerns abouthate speech,political extremismandmisinformation. Along withother social media platforms, YouTube has been utilised bydrug cartelsandharnessed by terroristsas a tool for promotion and recruitment.\nYouTube says that the company has employed a set of community guidelines since its earliest days to establish what's allowed on the platform. The company says it has redoubled efforts to address its responsibilities. One way YouTube measures its success is through its \"violative view rate\". In 2017, for every 10,000 views on YouTube, 63-72 views came from content that violated YouTube policies, but today that number has fallen to eight to nine views, according to the company.\nYouTube says it gives users several ways to manage YouTube recommendations and search results, such as deleting your Watch History.\nWhen the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure set out to study YouTube, part of the impetus was to document how common hate speech and misinformation is on the platform. \"If you go looking for it, you'll find it,\" McGrady says, but compared to the total body of videos on YouTube it's exceedingly unusual. Still, it doesn't matter how rare a damaging video is if it gets a ton of views, McGrady says, and harmful content remains a serious issue on YouTube.\nIn recent years, Google has faced a wave of scrutiny from policy makers, withnew lawsand a mountain ofproposed regulations– not to mention a series ofantitrust cases. But when the regulatoryconversation turns to the videoson YouTube themselves, the focus is almost always on content that goes viral, McGrady says.\nThis ignores the obligations YouTube should have because, according to McGrady, the company is running a piece of essential infrastructure.\nMore like this:\n•The ghosts of India's TikTok\n•Google just updated its algorithm. The internet will never be the same\n•The riddles humans can solve but computers can't\n\"The internet is deeply troubled, and we can't ignore the way tech companies are exacerbating those problems,\" McGrady says. \"What makes me hopeful is that when you find a way to look at how people are really using the web, a lot of it still feels like the early internet. It's expression, communication, connection. Fundamentally, it's a place where regular people share themselves and do wonderful things.\"\nThe YouTube we talk about – the one full of celebrities, scandals and manufactured virality – only tells part of the story. The majority exists in quiet moments, in shaky camera work and voices meant for no one in particular.  I watched hundreds of these videos. Everything one of them is public, but it's also clear that most people didn't upload this content for strangers. It was like being let in on a secret, a sprawling, uncurated documentary of human life. But watching it also felt like work compared to the doomscroll-inducing entertainment you get from the algorithm. Eventually, I closed my tabs and headed back to the YouTube homepage, back to the polished world of the corporate internet.\n* Thomas Germain is a senior technology journalist for the BBC.

    "content": "Fortified breakfast cereals can be a useful source of fibre, vitamins and minerals – but some are considered ultra-processed food.\nWe're often told that breakfast is themost important meal of the day. Get this decision right and your nutritious morning meal can help keepyou energisedandfocusedfor whatever challenges come your way. Yet the choice of what to eat for breakfast – or what to give your children if you have them – can feel overwhelming at times.\nIf, like53% of the US populationyou decide to go the breakfast cereal route every week, then you can take your pick. There's porridge oats, granola, muesli, bran flakes, corn flakes, and puffed rice – the options are endless, with each colourful box promising to deliver a healthy, nutritious meal. Yet, although breakfast cereals have traditionally been seen this way, somescientists warn that these are ultra-processed snacks– and they are not actually good for us at all.\nSo, what is the truth, and what kind of cereals – if any – should we be eating?\nFirst off, some facts. Cereals aregrasses from thePoaceaefamily, cultivated for their edible seeds, or grains. Cereal crops include wheat, rice, oats, barley and corn. Each cereal grain hasthree main edible components. There's the outer layer of bran, which is rich in fibre,B vitamins and trace minerals. Then there's theendosperm, which is packed withstarchand proteins to support the developing plant embryo. Finally, the germ contains the embryo, and is rich inoils,vitamins and minerals.\nOne of the first people tocome up with the ideaof turning grains into breakfast cereals was John Harvey Kellogg, an American physician. At the time he was asuperintendent of the Battle Creek Sanatarium– a kind of hybrid between a hospital and a health resort. To improve the patients' diet, Kellogg developed, patented and introduced a variety of new foods, including Granola andCorn Flakes. However, these have now become so ubiquitous that there are dozens of generic versions on the market.\nToday the production of breakfast cereals is an industrial affair. After the grains are harvested, breakfast cereals will undergo variousprocessing stepsbefore being packaged and sent to supermarket aisles. Some cereals – such as bran flakes – are made from the entire, or whole grain, while in others, such as some corn flakes, the grain is crushed between large metal rollers to remove theouter layer of bran.Some cereals then undergo further processing where the grain is milled into flour.\nThe resulting product is then mixed with flavourings, salt, sweeteners and other ingredients such as vitamins and minerals. They are thencookedand shaped into flakes, loops or other forms. Finally, the cereal is baked or toasted to give it a crisp texture.\nMore like this:\n•The perfect, but slow, way to boil an egg – according to science\n•Choline: The underappreciated nutrient that's vital for our brains\n•The ruler drop test: Check your reaction times\nBecause cereals arefortifiedwith minerals and vitamins, they have long been seen as an effective way of ensuring that people get the nutrients they need. This is especially true for individuals with restricted diets who may struggle to get the vitamins they require from food. Vegetarian and vegan diets, for example, tend to below in vitamin B12, while a person with lactose intolerance may avoid milk and therefore not get enoughcalcium and vitamin D. As we get older,we absorb certain nutrients less efficiently, which can increase the risk of malnourishment.Pregnant women and childrenare also at greater risk of nutrient deficiencies.\nResearch confirms that there may be some benefits from eating fortified breakfast cereals. For example, studies have shown thatmany populations around the worldaredeficient in key nutrients.A study in the US, meanwhile, found that without fortification, a high percentage of children and adolescents wouldn'tget enough micronutrients, risking long term health problems. Many breakfast cereals are also high in fibre, a nutrient that fuels the \"good\" bacteria in our guts – which 90% of usdon't get enough of.\n\"Generally speaking, fortified cereals can make a useful contribution to some of the vitamins and minerals that, in the UK, some of us are deficient in,\" saysSarah Berry, professor of nutrition at King's College London.\nFor example, Berry points to the fact that in the UK,almost 50% of girls aged 11 to 18have low iron intakes. Meanwhile, 14% of adults in the US haveinadequate intakes of this nutrient.(Read more from the BBC aboutthe global challenge of iron deficiency, and the debate over when to take iron supplements.)\n\"However, you have to balance this out against the fact that there are many cereals that are high in sugar, low in fibre, and have a high glycaemic index, which means they aren't going to keep you full for long,\" says Berry. There are also ways of getting these vitamins and minerals that might be better for you, such as fruits, nuts, and vegetables, she says.\nWhile some breakfast cereals are high in fibre, vitamins and minerals, many are also high in added sugar, salt and unhealthy fats.\nAccording to the British Heart Foundation, a charity that funds cardiovascular research based in the UK, a 30g serving ofsugar-frosted corn flakes, for example, contains around 11g of sugar. This is 12% of the maximumtotal recommended intake(RI) for sugars in the UK. (In the US, there isn't a recommended limit for total sugars, but the daily reference intake for added sugars is50g per day(based on a 2,000 calorie diet). Meanwhile, a 45g serving of granola with dried fruit, nuts, and seeds, meanwhile, has 9.6g of sugar (10.7% of your total RI).\nEating so much sugar in one go is likely to lead to large blood sugar spikes, which over time may leave you at greater risk of developingdiabetes,heart diseaseand other conditions. People who experience blood sugar spikes and dips are also inclined to feel hungrier sooner, leading to unhealthy snacking.\n\"We know from our ownresearchthat if you eat a breakfast high in sugar or refined carbohydrates, then two to four hours afterwards you tend to feel less energetic, more hungry, and less alert as well,\" says Berry. \"What we've also shown is that people who have that dip after their breakfast tend to consume their next meal30 minutes beforesomeone who has a breakfast that doesn't cause them to have a dip, and they tend to consume, on average, 100 calories more at their next meal.\"\nThere is also concern that some breakfast cereals are an ultra-processed food, which means that they have undergone significant industrial processing. They frequently contain added sugars, preservatives, artificial colours and other additives.\n\"As a mum and a scientist, I am cautious about allowing my children to eat cereals that contain a lot of colourants,\" says Berry.\n\"Whilst in the UK there are stringent regulations in place to show the safety of these additives and colourants, I think there's a lot that we still don't know about how they may impact our health in the long term,\" adds Berry. \"We are starting to understand that they may negatively impact factors such as our gut microbiome, but we just don't know enough yet.\"\nHowever, not everyone agrees. Someexpertsandhealth charitiesargue that lumping all ultra processed foods (UPF) together is too simplistic – and not all processed foods are bad for you. For example, a2024 studyby researchers at the Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health, Massachusetts, found that while sugary drinks and processed meats raised the risk of cardiovascular disease, the opposite was true for ultra processed breads, breakfast cereals, yogurts and dairy desserts.\nAnd not all breakfast cereals are created equal. Berry counts granola and muesli as healthy options, as long as they don't contain too much added sugar. \"It's about building a breakfast that has the fats, the protein, and the carbohydrate that's going to cause that more sustained release of energy and keep you feeling fuller for longer,\" she says. \"Granolas and muesli have lots of nuts, seeds and berries in them, so they have got loads of fibre, but also protein and fat from the nuts. That will keep youfull for longerand will therefore balance your energy levels better.\"\nAnother popular breakfast choice is porridge, or oatmeal as it is known in the US. Onelarge review studyincluded data from more than 470,000 individuals, and followed their health outcomes over years or decades. The researchers found that those with the highest oat intake had a 22% lower likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those with the lowest consumption. Those who consumed at least 19g per day also had a 24% lower risk of death from all causes compared to those who ate the least.\nThe key ingredient thought to be responsible for the health benefits of oats is a dietary fibre known as beta glucan. Beta glucan has been shown in many clinical trials to reducecirculating cholesterol levels, particularly low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the 'bad' cholesterollinked to heart disease. Some studies also suggest that beta glucan may reduce a person's risk of developingtype 2 diabetes, and help them developbetter insulin control.\nHowever, many oat-based breakfast cereals are made from finely ground oat flours that do not have the samehealth benefitsas whole, rolled oats. Compared to the latter, the large surface area of breakfast cereals made with oat flour means they are more quickly digested, causing sugar to rapidly enter the bloodstream. The same is true of pre-cooked porridges made from \"instant oats\".\nIn oneclinical trial,volunteers were asked to eat rolled oats on one day, and instant finely-ground oats on another day. The researchers found that despite the oats containing the same amount of fibre, protein, fat, and carbohydrates, the more finely ground oats produced a much larger spike in the participants' blood sugar levels.\nMeanwhile, breakfast cereals made from refined grains, where the nutrient and fibre-rich bran and germ layers have been stripped away, may also have fewer benefits. While studies have shown that the consumption of whole grains is linked to a reduced risk of cancer, cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases, research suggests that some of these health effectsdon't seem to applywhen grains are consumed in their refined forms.\n\"Whole grain cereals are healthy because they are packed with fibre,\" says Riccardo Caccialanza, a clinical nutritionist at the University of Pavia in Italy. He explains that one important function of this nutrient is to slow down the digestion of food, so you get fewer glucose peaks and better glucose control. \"However, if you take the fibre away, which happens when you refine the grain, then the glucose increases more quickly,\" he says.\nSo, are breakfast cereals good or bad for us? It depends entirely on the cereal.\nOne study in Australia looked at over 140,000 people aged 45 years and older. It found that eatingmuesli for breakfastlowered the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Anotherlarge studyasked over 186,000 participants aged 40 to 69 years in the UK about their dietary habits – including breakfast cereal consumption – and then followed the participants for an average of 13 years. It found that people who ate at least one bowl muesli, bran-based cereals, and porridge a day were 15%, 12%, and 11% less likely to die during the follow up period than people who did not eat breakfast cereals. On the other hand, individuals who ate sweetened cereals for breakfast were more likely to die of cancer during the study period.\nThe key, then, is to look at the back of the pack carefully, say experts. \"If you're selecting cereals that have about less than five grams of sugar a portion, and more than three grams of fibre per portion, then you're on track to making a healthier choice for your cereal,\" says Berry.\nBut to make it extra healthy, both Berry and Caccialanza suggest 'hacking' or customising your cereal so that it doesn't just contain carbohydrates, but also has a good mix of healthy fats and protein that will keep you feeling full for longer.\n\"I love a granola, but I add extra nuts and kefir yoghurt to it,\" says Berry. \"I make a supermarket standard granola healthy by what I overlay on top. And I think that's something that people should be thinking about a little bit – what can they do to add some balance to [breakfast cereals]?\"\nFor trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to theHealth Fix newsletter,whileThe Essential Listdelivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

It provided definitive evidence that racial groupings have no biological basis. In fact, there is more genetic variationwithin racial groups than between them. Race, it showed, is a social construct.\nBut despite that fundamental finding, which has only been reinforced as work on human genomes has continued, race and ethnicity are still often deployed to categorise human populations as distinct biological groups. These are views that can be found circulating in the pseudoscience on social media, but they also still creep intoscientific researchandhealthcare systems.\nIt is even more troubling when this thinking finds its way into the halls of government.\nPresident Donald Trumpandhis administrationhave madeno secretof his rejection of many aspects of the scientific worldview. Since returning to the White House, he has madesweeping cutstoscience fundingforbiomedicalandclimate research, but in a recent Executive Order, Trump took aim at what most scientists now regard as biological reality.\nEntitled \"Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History\", the Presidential order, signed by Trump,targeted an exhibition in the Smithsonian American Art Museumcalled \"The Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture\".\nThe order is part of a broader attempt to shape American culture by eliminating \"improper, divisive, or anti-American ideology\" from the institute's museums. It states: \"Museums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn – not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history.\"\nThe exhibition itself is criticised in the text for promoting the idea that \"race is not a biological reality but a social construct, stating 'race is a human invention'\". The order offers the exhibition as an example of a \"harmful and oppressive\" shift in the narrative portraying American values.\nThis is the point when people like me, a geneticist who specialises in the history of race science, get a little bit vexed.\nThe issue here is that the sentence cited from the Smithsonian is 100% correct. This is neither controversial in science nor history.\nHuman variation is, of course, very real. People are different, and we can see those differences in skin pigmentation, in hair colour and texture and in other physical characteristics. These differences cluster in locations around the world: people from the same region on average look more similar to each other than to people from other areas – so far, so obvious.\nIn the 18th Century, these traits were the primary determinants for a new fashion for categorising humans in supposedly scientific terms. The Swedish botanistKarl Linnaeusis legitimately credited as the father of modern biology, as he gave usthe classification system we still use today: genus and species. Every living thing is named according to this system, for example the bacteriaEscherichia coli, or the lion,Panthera leo, orGorilla gorilla, which probably doesn't need explaining.\nWe areHomo sapiens– wise people. But in his foundational workSystemae Naturae, Linnaeus introduced anothertier of classification for us, designated primarily by that most visible of human traits: pigmentation. Linnaeus gave us four types of human, lumped together by continental landmasses:Asiaticus– people with \"yellow skin\", and straight black hair;Americanus– indigenous Americans, with \"red skin\" also with straight black hair;Africanus– \"black skinned\" people with tight curls in their hair; andEuropeaus– \"white skinned\" with blue eyes.\nThese designations are clearly absurd – none of the colours are accurate, even if you took the obviously incorrect view that millions of people share the same skin tones even within those categories. But the roots of the race designations we still use today are visible in these labels. Some of these terms have fallen out of social acceptability and are considered racist. But we still use \"black\" and \"white\" as descriptors for millions of people, none of whom really have either black or white skin.\nEven if this colour scheme were true, Linnaeus' original descriptions only began with physical traits. What he included in later editions ofSystemae Naturae, which became thebasis for scientific racism, were portrayals of behaviours.Asiaticuswere described as \"haughty, greedy and ruled by opinions\" while Americanus were labelled \"stubborn, zealous, regulated by customs\".Africanuswomen were denoted as being \"without shame\" while both sexes were said to be \"crafty, lazy, and governed by caprice\". He describedEuropaeusas \"gentle, acute, inventive, governed by laws\".\nBy any definition in any age, these assertions are racist and entirely incorrect.\nOf course, in examining history, we must be wary of judging people from the past by our own standards. But as the foundational text of modern biology, introducing a classification system for humans that is ludicrous, racist and most importantly, hierarchical, would leave an indelible mark on the centuries that followed.\nOver the next 200 years, many men would seek to refine these categories with new metrics, including pseudoscientific interpretations of craniometry, or skull measurements. They never settled on a definitive answer about how many races there are – none of the characteristics that were being used are immutable, nor exclusive to the people to whom they were supposedly essential. We call this ideology \"racial essentialism\". But all of the many schemes put white Europeans as superior to all others.\nIt was biologist Charles Darwin who first began to unpick these ideas, recognising in his 1871 book theDescent of Manthat there was much more continuity in traits between people that had been designated as discrete races. By the beginning of the 20th Century, molecular biology had entered the stage, and the era of genetics would dismantle the biological concept of race.\nBy the time we began to look at how genes are shared in families and populations, we saw that similarities do indeed cluster in groups, but these groupings do not align with the longstanding attempts to classify the races. The true metric of human difference is at a genetic level. In the 20th Century, when we began to unravel our genomes, and observe how people are similar and different in our DNA, we saw that the terms in use for several centuries bore little meaningful relation to the underlying genetics.\nEven though only a tiny percentage of our DNA differs between individuals, the genome is so large and complex that there is great diversity. Geneticists are still working tounravel how this alters people's health, for example. But those genetic differences do not delineate along the lines of what we call race. They follow ancestral lines, can differ bygeographic locationand can be traced throughhistoric migration patterns.\nWhat we now know is that there ismore genetic diversity in people of recent African descentthan in the rest of the world put together. Take two people, for example from Ethiopia and Namibia, and they will be more different to each other at a genetic level than either one of them is to a white European, or indeed a Japanese person, an Inuit or an Indian. This includes the genesthat are involved in pigmentation.\nYet, for historical reasons, we continue to refer to both Ethiopians and Namibians under the race definition of \"black\". Or take African Americans, people largely descended from enslaved Africans brought to the New World: sequencing the genomes of Black Americans reveals echoes of the history of transatlantic slavery. They not only mixed genetic ancestry from the handful of West African countries from which their ancestors were taken, but also significant amounts of White European DNA. This reflects the fact that slave owners had sexual relationships – many of which would not have been consensual – with enslaved people.\nTherefore, the simple categorisation of descendants of the enslaved as \"black\" similarly does not make biological sense. They are genetically diverse in themselves and different from the African ancestors from which they are descended. To lump them together makes no scientific sense.\nSo it is by consensus, usage and history that we continue to use the term \"black\". This is what we mean by a social construct. The concept of race has little utility as a biological taxonomy. But it is enormously important socially and culturally. Social constructs are how the world works: money and time are both socially constructed too. The value of a pound or dollar is applied by agreement against goods and services. Time passes unerringly, but hours and minutes are entirely arbitrary units.\nSo, while race is not biologically meaningful, it has biologically meaningfulconsequences.Theimpactof most diseasescorrelates with poverty. As people of ethnic minority ancestry tend to be inlower tiers of socio-economic status, diseases tend to affect them more severely. This is true across the board, but wasexposed early on in the pandemic. Black, South Asian and in America Hispanic people were disproportionately infected with and died of Covid-19.\nThe media immediately began to search for a reason that reified a biological version of race, sometimes focusing on vitamin D metabolism, which is connected with melanin production, and has effects on viral infections. Some studies showed that lower levels ofvitamin D did associate with susceptibility to covid infectionamong black people. But this is a correlation not a cause.\nMore like this:\n•The people whose DNA held a secret\n•Why you have viruses hiding in our DNA\n•The mystery of the human genome’s dark matter\nUnderlying any slight differences in biology are much more potent causes: while so many of us were locked down, frontline NHS workers, people cleaning up our rubbish and driving our buses all were more likely to be from ethnic minorities. They simply had ahigher risk of being exposed and so infected with the virus. Combine that with the fact thatminority groups are more likely to live in multigenerational, dense urban housing, and the supposedly biological susceptibility fades.\nThis is why genetics has played such an important role in the dismantling of a scientific justification of race and understanding racism itself. And it's why the latest statement from Trump's White House istroubling many in the scientific community.\nTrump frequently speaks about aspects of genetics to make political points. One view that he has expressed repeatedly is that some people, and predictably himself, are genetically superior. \"You have good genes, you know that, right?\" he said in September 2020 to a rally in Minnesota – a state that ismore than 80% white. \"You have good genes. A lot of it is about the genes, isn't it, don't you believe? You have good genes in Minnesota.\"\nSimilarly, in the successful 2024 campaign, hedenounced immigrants as having \"bad genes\". It's hard for someone who studies genes – and the strange and sometimes troubling history of genetics – to understand even what might constitute a \"bad\" or \"good\" gene.\nOurs may be a pernicious history, but the trajectory of genetics has been one that tends towards progress, and equity for all, as enshrined in the Declaration of Independence.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "Genetic factors are thought to play a major role in the development of autism – but for decades what they are has proven elusive. Now scientists are starting to uncover clues.\nUntil the 1970s, the prevailing belief in psychiatry was that autism was a consequence of bad parenting. In the 1940s, the Austrian psychiatrist Leo Kanner had coined thecontroversial \"refrigerator mother\" theorysuggesting that autism arose from early childhood trauma, created by mothers who were cold, uncaring and rejected their children.\nDaniel Geschwind, a neuroscience and genetics professor at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), says that this is now rightly recognised as being deeply damaging and wrong – but it took the better part of three decades for Kanner's theory to be debunked. It was not until 1977, when a couple of psychiatrists carried outa landmark studydemonstrating that autism often runs in identical twins, that a more nuanced and accurate picture of autism's origins began to emerge.\nThat 1977 study was the first time that a genetic component of autism had been identified.Research has since shownthat when one identical twin is autistic, the likelihood that the other twin will be too can be more than 90%. Meanwhile, the chances of fraternal twins of the same sex each sharing a diagnosis of autism arearound 34%. These levels are substantially higher than the typicalrate of occurrenceamong the wider population, of around 2.8%.\nIt is now widely accepted that there is a strong genetic component to autism. But which genes are involved and how their expression is influenced by other factors are only just starting to be unravelled.\nEven after the twin study in 1977, it would take several more decades for the full subtleties of the interaction between autism and the human genome to become apparent.\nBetween any two individuals, the amount of genetic variation is around 0.1%, meaning thatapproximately one letter or base pair out of every 1,000in their DNA will be different. \"Sometimes these variations have no effect at all,\" says Thomas Bourgeron, a neuroscience professor at the Institut Pasteur in Paris. \"Sometimes they have a little effect, and sometimes they have a super strong effect.\"\nCurrently, \"super strong\" variations have been identified inup to 20%of all cases of autism, with a single mutation in a single gene being largely responsible for driving critical neurodevelopmental differences. The role of these single gene mutations and how they arise is one of the most heavily studied areas in autism research, because as Bourgeron explains, they often result in severe and life-limiting disabilities.\n\"This is not like the autism you see in the movies,\" Bourgeron says. \"If you're born with one of these major mutations, there's a high likelihood you'll end up with intellectual disability or motor delay [the ability to coordinate muscle groups] or epileptic encephalopathy. It has a major impact on their quality of life and their family in most cases.\"\nSo far scientists have identifiedat least 100 geneswhere these mutations can occur. Bourgeron himself made one of the first discoveries in March 2003 when heidentified two gene mutationslinked to autism. Each impacted proteins involved in synaptogenesis, the process of forming connections between neurons in the brain. It was a major breakthrough, although it barely made a ripple in the media at the time, with Bourgeron recalling how former US President George W Bush hadrecently declared waron Iraq.\nBut more discoveries were to come, includingmutations in the Shank3 genewhich are estimated to occur in less than1% of people with autism. We now know that some of these mutations are known asde novovariants, which means that they occur through random chance in a developing embryo and aren't present in the blood DNA of either the mother or father. Geschwind describesde novovariants as being akin to a \"bolt of lightning\", that is both unexpected and rare.\nHowever, in other cases, these mutations can have been passed on by one of the parents, even if both appear to be neurotypical, a more complex phenomenon which researchers have only begun to understand in the past decade.\n\"You might wonder, if an autistic child has inherited a rare gene mutation from one of their parents, why doesn't the parent have autism too?\" says Geschwind. \"What seems to happen is that in the parent, it's not sufficient to be causal, but in the child, that major gene mutation combines additively with other, less individually impactful gene variants to drive neurodevelopment differences,\" he says.\nOf course, there are also thought to be environmental factors involved in the development of autism – even among identical twins where one has been diagnosed,10% of the timethe other one will not be.\nHistorically, identifying the environmental factors behind autism has led to pseudoscientific beliefs such as the idea –now widely debunked– that certain vaccines might be involved. Now the US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr has pledged a massive research effort toidentify the causes of autismbefore September 2025. This includes hiring the vaccine sceptic David Geier as a data analyst at the US Department of Health & Human Services.The Autism Society of Americahave expressed concerns that the plans areunrealistic, as well as potentially harmful and misleading.\nAccording to the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), potentialnon-genetic causes of autisminclude prenatal exposure to air pollution and certain pesticides, extreme prematurity, and birth difficulties leading to oxygen deprivation in the baby's brain, among other factors.\nToday genetic research is leading progress into how neurodevelopment can lead to autism. It appears that many of these genes become functionalduring the formation of the cortex– the wrinkly outer layer of the brain responsible for many high-level functions, including memory, problem-solving and thinking.\nThis critical part of brain development occurs in the foetusas it is developing in the womb, and according to Geschwind, peaks somewhere between 12 and 24 weeks. \"You can think of these mutations as disrupting the normal patterns of development, knocking development off of its normal track so to speak and maybe onto another tributary, instead of the normal, neurotypical pattern of development,\" says Geschwind.\nBecause they cause such severe disability, the information about these gene mutations has enabled parents to form support groups, for example theFamilieSCN2A Foundationwhich serves as a community for families of autistic children where the autism diagnosis has been linked to a genetic change in the SCN2A gene.Discussions have also beenheld regarding the idea of using such genetic information to influence future reproductive decisions.\n\"If it's ade novovariant, then you can tell the parents that the risk would be low [of having another child with the same neurodevelopmental challenges], because there is a limited contribution from inherited factors, if they decided to have subsequent children,\" says Geschwind. \"We can also give the family a sense of the spectrum of how their child might develop over time, and for parents of a two-year-old that's non-verbal and has some walking delay, they want to know what to expect.\"\nBut while this can offer huge benefits for these families, the concept of genetic research isnot viewed with universal positivityacross the autistic community. Autism isa vast spectrum, ranging from those with severe impairments in physical and mental development which will never allow them to live independently, to others with far fewer support needs who view their autism as an identity andadvantage, andoppose depictionsof autism as a disorder.\nBecause of this, for some autistic people, their families and a number of academic researchers, the compilation of genetic datahas yielded ongoing concernsabout how it might be used.\nIn the past half century, genetics studies have shown that in the majority of autistic people, their neurodiversity arises throughthe additive effectsof hundreds oreven thousandsof relatively common gene variants which they have inherited from both parents.\nThese gene variants exist throughout the population of both neurotypical and neurodivergent people, andthe individual contribution of any one of these genes to neurodevelopment is negligible. But in combination, they have a significant effect on the wiring of the brain. Bourgeron says that it is not uncommon for one or both parents, who carry some of these gene variants, to display autistic traits such as a preference for order, difficulties in detecting emotions, and being hyperaware of patterns; but unlike their child, these traits do not manifest to such a significant degree that they themselves could be diagnosed as autistic.\nOver the last 20 years, autism researchers have devised some ingenious ways of identifying some of these more subtle variants. In the early 2000s, Simon Baron-Cohen, a professor of psychology and psychiatry at the University of Cambridge, and colleagues, devised a test calledReading the Mind in the Eyes.This is intended to assess a person's ability to detect emotions such as looking playful, comforting, irritated or bored – based on a photograph which shows only the person's eyes.\nThe idea is that poorer performance on the test indicates a higher likelihood of a person being autistic. \"Autistic individuals have a different way of looking at the face, and they seem to get more information from a person's mouth,\" says Bourgeron. \"Neurotypical individuals get more information from the eyes.\"\nMore recently, in partnership with the DNA testing site 23andMe, which agreed to host the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test on their website, Bourgeron and Baron-Cohenwere able to gather dataon the abilities of more than 88,000 people to read thoughts and emotions from a person's eyes, and compare this performance with their genetic information. Through this dataset, they were able to identify large groups of gene variants associated with poorer emotion recognition, many of which are thought to be carried by autistic people.\nOther research studies have found that common gene variants associated with autismtend to benegatively correlated with empathy or social communication. But they arepositively correlatedwith the ability to analyse and construct systems as well as rules and routines. Most intriguingly, they are also often linked tohigher educational attainment, along withgreater spatial or mathematical or artistic abilities. \"This perhaps explains why these genetic variants, which come from very distant ancestors, have remained in the population throughout human history,\" says Geschwind.\nGeschwind and Baron-Cohen are now embarking on a project to try to understand whether some of the common gene variants linked with autism can explain why autismseems to be more prevalent in men, and why autistic women arethought to be more adeptat masking their neurodivergent traits compared with autistic men.\n\"The likelihood is that differences in male and female brain development and function make the men more susceptible and the women protected from the genetic susceptibility to autism to some degree, but we don't fully understand that yet,\" says Geschwind.\nHowever, some experts believe that autism may be much more common in women than is currently thought, and that the experiences of this group arebeing overlooked.\nGeschwind suggests that understanding sex differences in autism could help identify protective factors which could be used as future treatments, yet this very concept remains deeply divisive and reflective of one of the core underlying tensions within autism research. While some scientistspursue treatments, other researchers and some autistic people believe that autism is not a disorder to be fixed, butan identity and a shared experience.\n\"Autism isn't a biological phenomenon that has to be tested for, and where you get a categorical outcome or prognosis,\" says Sue Fletcher-Watson, professor of developmental psychology at the University of Edinburgh. \"It isn't something, like cancer, that is universally agreed to be bad and for which everyone wants a cure. In my opinion, it never will be.\"\nIn particular, Fletcher-Watson says that many autistic people fear that the ultimate outcome of autism genetic research will be a prenatal test, which could pose an existential threat to autism. Beginning in 2005, one activist createdthe Autistic Genocide Clock, stating that if such a test existed, it would represent a continuation of historic attempts to eliminate minority groups. Two decades later, such fears remain.\n\"Genetic researchers on the whole have done little to listen to, and address, the fears of the autistic community regarding security and future use of genetic data,\" says Fletcher-Watson. These fears are heightened by political contexts, she says, such as the strength of certain far-right parties, which make the possibility of eugenic use of genetic data seem much more real.\nPrenatal tests are alreadyestablished practice in the UKfor conditions caused by having an extra copy of a chromosome in some or all of the body’s cells. These includeDown's syndrome(where there's an extra copy of chromosome 21),Edward syndrome(where there's an extra copy of chromosome 18), andPatau syndrome(where there's an extra copy of chromosome 13), and in some countries like Iceland, termination rates following a positive screenare close to 100%,\"she says.\nJoseph Buxbaum, a psychiatry professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, who founded theAutism Sequencing Consortium, an international group of scientists who share samples and genetic data, feels that some autistic activists are missing the point.\n\"When I get challenged by somebody who says, 'Well I have autism and I don't think I need be researched,' I'm like, 'Well, how about somebody who has no language, an IQ of 50 and will never be able to live alone and unsupervised,'\" says Buxbaum. \"What are your thoughts about that person? So, when I think about interventions, I'm thinking about these people, as opposed to someone who has trouble maintaining eye contact, unusual interests and conflicts in social situations.\"\nGeschwind agrees, also citing the marked differences which exist across the autistic spectrum. \"The majority of the spectrum is a condition that has to be accommodated like any other disability,\" he says. However, he adds that another cohort – those who are more severely impacted – would warrant treatment. \"These are different things,\" he says.\nTo try and better stratify the broad spectrum of autistic traits, the Lancet Commissionformally recognisedthe term \"profound autism\" in 2021, as a way of describing autistic people who are unable to advocate for themselves and are likely to require 24-hour support throughout their lives. Since then, a variety ofclinical trialshave begun, all using various therapeutic strategies to try andtarget the single genesunderpinning physical and intellectual disability in different individuals with profound autism.\nThe main idea for these treatments surrounds the fact that all of us havetwo copies or alleles, or variants, of every single gene, one from each parent. Arecent studyfrom Geschwind's lab leveraged the understanding that most of thede novogene mutations linked with profound autism only knock out one of these copies, suggesting it might be possible to reduce the degree of disability by boosting the unaffected copy. \"That means you have one unaffected copy, [the activity of which] which we showed could be turned up to compensate,\" says Geschwind.\nBourgeron has recently been runninga clinical trial using the metal lithiumto boost a version of the Shank3 gene in autistic children who are known to have Shank3 mutations. In the future, Geschwind suggests that a technology such as Crispr, which allows scientists to edit a person's DNA, could be used to intervene at an even earlier stage of life. For example, gene therapy could be delivered to unborn babies found to have various mutations, while they are still in the womb. \"We've recently figured out a way of doing this,\" he says. \"It might not fully correct the impacted gene, but it could at least partially correct it.\"\nThe FDA has recently granted approval for the US-based biotechnology company Jaguar Gene Therapyto run a clinical trialwhere a gene therapy is administered to autistic children with a Shank3 gene mutation along with a co-occurring genetic condition called Phelan-McDermid syndrome which affects development, speech and behaviour.\n\"This trial is only possible because all the children participating have genetic diagnoses,\" says Buxbaum. \"And because researchers at Mount Sinai and elsewhere have spent the past 15 years studying how these children develop when they have these mutations. We can then use this natural history data as a control in the study.\"\nBut while such trials could undoubtedly result in enormous benefits for the children involved and their families, Fletcher-Watson is still sceptical about their depiction as therapies for autism, profound or otherwise. She would prefer to see them characterised as treatments for intellectual disability.\n\"I believe that when people talk about these single-gene cases of autism, they are being disingenuous,\" says Fletcher-Watson. \"They are talking about single-gene causes of intellectual disability, perhaps many of whom are also autistic. But there is funding available for research to address autism, active parent campaign groups and all sorts of resources, in a way that there is not for intellectual disability.\"\nAt the same time, Fletcher-Watson is more optimistic about the potential of genetic research to devise novel treatments for some of the co-occurring conditions with which autistic people are often diagnosed, includingepilepsy,sleep disturbances,OCDandgastrointestinal disorders.\nBourgeron now coordinatesa European projecton risk, resilience and developmental diversity in mental health, collaborating with autistic people and their families to better understand why autism rarely comes in isolation, and what makes different individuals prone to these conditions.\nAt the same time, Bourgeron says that we also need to better recognise neurodiversity and reduce stigma relating to autism. \"I think that for us as geneticists we need to go back to the needs of each person\" he says. \"Some autistic individuals with Shank3 mutations are so severely impacted that they need round the clock care. For others, they might only need specific support at school.\n\"Overall, we need to do a better job of recognising neurodiversity, and doing everything we can to make sure that people who function differently from the majority can flourish in our societies.\"\nFor trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to theHealth Fix newsletter, whileThe Essential Listdelivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "Your reaction times can reveal a surprising amount about what's going on inside your body, from your brain health to your risk of an early death.\nOf the course of our lifetimes, our reaction times will slowly wane. It's one of the reasons why athletic performance tends to drop offfrom our 30s onwards.\nScientists are finding that being able to maintain an average reaction speed can be a key indicator that our brain is still in good working order, even into our latter decades. But that isn't all they can reveal. From your heart health to youroverall risk of an early death, your reaction times can provide a window into the inner workings of the body.\n\"Some people just tend to be faster than others, even before ageing effects really kick in,\" says Simon Cox, professor of brain and cognitive ageing at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. \"But a decline in reaction times probably indicates an accumulation of age-related degradation. It's a marker which tells us a lot about the combined functioning of quite a lot of biological systems.\"\nBut how can you assess your reaction time in the comfort of your home?\nOne easy assessment is awell-known experiment known as the \"ruler drop test\".You'll need the assistance of a family member or friend for this one, as well as a ruler:\n• Sit in a chair, resting your arm on a table so that your wrist is hanging off the edge, with your thumb and forefingers facing up.\n• Ask your partner to hold a ruler vertically, over your hand, with the \"zero\", where the numbers start, aligned with your thumb.\n• Without warning, your partner should drop the ruler, while you try to catch it as quickly as possible.\n• The distance the ruler falls before being caught is an assessment of your reaction time.\nBroadly speaking,an excellent performance equatesto catching the ruler at a distance less than 7.5cm, above average counts as 7.5-15.9cm, average is 15.9-20.4cm, while below average is anything over 20.4cm and poor is more than 28cm.\nPopulation studies have noticed a correlation between the speed of decline in reaction times and risk ofmultiple age-related illnesses. In addition to a person's overall risk of death – one study found that there was a significant link between a person's reaction times and the likelihood of death fromall major causes– there is also a strong relationship between this metric and the risk of death from specific conditions. This includescoronary heart disease, stroke and respiratory disease.\nA person's reaction times are also associated with theirsusceptibility to falls,losing the ability to live independentlyand theonset of dementia.\nHowever, according to Cox, a single reaction time measurement doesn't reveal all that much, as reaction speedsvary considerablyfrom one person to another due to factors ranging from gender to genetics, physical fitness, lifestyle habits and even personality type. Cox notes that what is likely to be more important is how your reaction speed varies if you compare your performance on the same test over time – for example, at yearly intervals over the course of a decade - and whether it starts to noticeably decline.\nAs Cox points out, our ability to reactrelies ona network of interconnected sensory systems: how well we see, hear or even smell a given stimulus, how quickly our brain can process the information it's receiving from our eyes or ears and issue a signal in response, and finally how quickly our nerve fibres, muscles and tendons can enact what the brain is telling them to do. \"All these pieces of the jigsaw can be affected by ageing, and not necessarily to the same extent in all people,\" says Cox.\nThere are two components to a reaction to the ruler drop test – the brain's ability to make a quick assessment that it has been dropped, and the speed with which the body can act on the brain's instructions to catch it.\nResearchershave foundthat the first component of this network which tends to break down, beginning in midlife, is our physical ability to act on the brain's signals. So, our brains might notice that the ruler has been let go within milliseconds – but it still takes a while for the body to catch up.\nAt the University of Colorado Boulder, biomedical professor Alaa Ahmedhas foundthat as we get older, our reaction times may depend more heavily on our overall bodily health than our brain. She says this may be because things like fast-twitch muscle fibres which enable our physical ability to respond quickly,have waned, or because our mitochondria – the components within our cells which generate energy –are working less well, meaning that we're less efficient at moving swiftly.\n\"Making a faster movement is more costly to older adults, so they rely primarily on reacting faster,\" says Ahmed.\nAt the same time, if we stay relatively well, our brain and central nervous system can still function strongly into our latter years. According to Matthew Pain, a professor of biomechanics at Loughborough University in the UK, scientists have assessed thisby measuringthe \"startle reflex\" in the ankles of healthy elderly adults in response to a loud sound. The results showed their brain's ability to respond to the sound and send a \"move\" signal to the ankle tends to remain relatively intact.\n\"The raw nervous system hardware in healthy elderly [people] is not that [much] worse,\" says Pain. \"Purely based on the startle reflex, they could still react quickly enough to be disqualified at the Olympics for a false start. They wouldn't, however, be able to get out of the blocks very quickly.\"\nAs well as the ruler test, reaction times can be assessed through simple computer games such as theHuman Benchmark Reaction Time Testwhich involves waiting for a red box to turn green and then clicking on it as quickly as possible. Sharp deteriorations in performance over time can reflect a combination of sensory systems breaking down, as well as a slowing of the brain's decision-making.One study last yearfound that loss of visual sensitivity in seeing and responding to patterns can be one of the earliest signs of dementia, beginning more than a decade before symptoms begin.\n\"With age, the nerve fibres in the brain's white matter can start to communicate signals less efficiently, resulting in slower information processing,\" says Cox. \"Once the decision has been made to react, the nerves that connect your brain to your muscles also need to be in good condition to transmit that message quickly, and these age too.\"\nBut there are things that we can all do to either slow or prevent this decline from happening. Pain recommends so-called dual task training, which involves simultaneous movement and cognitive training activities to tune both the brain and body. Examples include walking while turning your head from side to side, balancing on one leg while reciting the alphabet, or tossing a ball while verbally associating words.\nEven things like such as participating in fitness classes via a TV screen or tablet can help with your reaction times. \"This improves the ability to perceive [a stimulus] and respond with meaningful coordinated motions,\" says Pain.\nCox says that many of the activities which are often linked with healthy ageing, such as continuing to play a sport into later life, learning a musical instrument in retirement or simply keeping engaged with intellectual pursuits such as board games can have knock-on benefits for our reaction times.\n\"Sports performance drills which require fast responses couldboost reaction timesby enhancing both brain and body,\" says Cox. \"And there's some evidence that generally keeping more socio-intellectually engaged is related to slower cognitive ageing across aspects of complex thinking.\"\nFor trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to theHealth Fix newsletter, whileThe Essential Listdelivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "With smartphones tougher than ever, a new wave of phone minimalists say cases are for cowards. I joined the case-free cult, called the experts and braced for the sound of broken glass.\nA few months ago I walked into an Apple store to buy a new iPhone. After sifting through models and upgrades, a cheerful salesperson told me the price came to $1,199 (£919). She laughed when I mentioned that's close to what I pay for a month's rent. \"Crazy, isn't it?\" she said. \"Now let's look at some phone cases.\"\nIt felt like the obvious next step. But even as the cost of mobile phones breaches the stratosphere, some seemingly reasonable consumers going a different route: they're walking around with their phones completely naked, moving through the concrete and the spills and the dust with no case, no screen protector, nothing. I know some of these people. Their phones are shiny, with titanium frames and carefully engineered glass on full display. They seem so happy and carefree. Is it all in my head? Is fear the only thing standing between me and case-free bliss?\n\"Come on man, just check out how this thing feels,\" a friend said to me couple of weeks later. A proud no-case guy, he handed me his iPhone. It was far more handsome without a case, and even better to hold. \"They build phones tougher now. I drop it all the time, it's fine.\"\nAccording to conversations I've had since then with glass manufacturers, die-hard anti-casers and people who get paid to damage phones on purpose, it seems he could be right. Experts agree: the modern smartphone is far more robust than its ancestors. Still, most people I know use protection. So who's the crazy one here?\nI decided to find out. When I got home, I tore the case off my phone, threw it in a drawer and committed to a month of sweating through the case-free lifestyle. I pitched my editor a story about it. He liked the idea but assured me the BBC would not pay for repairs if my experiment goes sour. May God have mercy on my soul.\nThere's been a lot of discussion about howgoing caselesshas becomea status symbolfor some who want to give off an air of class and confidence. When I interview tech executives and entrepreneurs, for example, phone cases are a rare sight.\n\"You're saying 'I can afford to replace this'. But it's not about appearances for me. I was a no-case guy even before my first startup,\" says Yousef Ali, chief executive of Blast Radio, a live audio platform for DJs. \"For me it just seems nuts to have a $1,000 [£766] luxury device known for its material design and spend your day touching a $30 [£23] plastic case instead. It's like putting a vinyl cover on your couch to save the fabric. I have expensive pants too, should I wear an extra pair of pants to protect them? Where does it end?\"\nI won't pretend the first week without a phone case didn't leave me feeling, well, kind of cool. It's the lamest possible version of flirting with danger. But trends come and go. What I want is facts – ideally some harder than the ground I picture my phone careening towards.\nIf you're reading this on a mobile phone, you're probably looking throughGorilla Glass, a patented, smash-resistant technology made by a company called Corning.All the big-name phone manufacturersuse Gorilla Glass or another Corning product for some or all of their screens, including Apple, Google, Huawei and Samsung. There are some exceptions for older phones and budget brands, but for the most part, Corning has the market cornered.\nThe Gorilla process starts with dipping glass in a bath of molten salt heated to 400C (752F). \"The bath pulls smaller ions such as lithium out of the glass and swaps in larger ions such as potassium,\" says Lori Hamilton, Corning's director of technology for Gorilla Glass. \"It creates this layer of compressive stress that makes it more difficult for flaws to penetrate through the glass.\" In other words, it squishes the glass together, making it less susceptible to damage.\nCorning's research involves putting phones through ritualistic torture to study what goes wrong and how to prevent it. Phones face specialglass scratching machinesand go into tumblers with car keys to simulate pockets. Corning even collects phones busted by consumers in the wild to find unusual damage.\n\"Then we go through a CSI-type effort called fracture analysis, where we study tiny shards of glass to understand the source of the original fracture,\" Hamilton says.\nWhen your phone breaks,it's the screen that failsmost of the time. But according to Hamilton, results have improved dramatically in recent years, and today's smartphones are far stronger. In 2016, Corning reported thatGorilla Glass 5survived drops of 0.8m (2.6ft) in the lab. That grew to 2m (6.6ft) withGorilla Glass Victusin 2020.Gorilla Armor 2, one of Corning's latest products featured on the Samsung Ultra S25, has reportedly braved up to 2.2m (7.2ft).\nOutside evidence seems to back up these improvements in phone materials, construction and design. In 2024, the insurance company Allstate, which sells phone protection plans, found that78 million Americansreported damaging their phones, compared to 87 million in 2020.\n\"We don't use the term unbreakable,\" says Hamilton. \"There will always be failures. There are always situations where you get a deep enough flaw or the right kind of bending.\" But Hamilton says skipping a case is reasonable, and at this point it's just a matter of preference. \"After all, phones are an investment,\" she says. \"I don't use a screen protector, but I actually do use a case.\" It's not for safety, though. It's a wallet case. \"I just like a place to put cards and money.\"\nGorilla Glass was invented for the iPhone, though the latest models use a similar but upgraded Corning glass technology called \"Ceramic Shield\" made with \"nano-ceramic crystals\".Apple claimsthe latest iteration of Ceramic Sheild for the iPhone 16 makes it \"2x tougher\" than the glass on any other smartphone.\nYou might think those crystals and ions would be enough to shield me from spending money on a phone case, but manufacturers send mixed messages.\nApple will sell you on the wonders of ceramics, but is also happy to sell you a case stamped with the Apple logo. My iPhone salesperson suggested I might like a nice blue one for $49 (£38). So, does an iPhone need a case? Apple wouldn't say: a spokesperson declined to comment.\nPhone case manufacturer Spigen, on the other hand, was happy to talk. \"It's true that phones are more durable than ever,\" says Justin Ma, a Spigen spokesperson. \"However, despite these advancements, these devices are always prone to accidents,\" he says.\nBut even Ma wouldn't call a case necessary. \"You might expect us to say everyone needs a case. But the reality is that it depends on the individual.\" Some people like the feel of a bare phone, some want maximum protection and still others choose a case for aesthetic purposes.\nWhatever their reasons, case users are a massive contingency. Ma says Spigen cases alone cover 100 million devices. The consulting firmTowards Packagingclocked the global phone case market at almost $25bn (£19bn) in 2024.\nI was standing in my kitchen drinking a glass of water when I got the itch for one last bedtime doomscroll. As I yanked my phone out of my pocket, my fingers slipped. My pristine iPhone made a ferocious arc through the air, bounced off the side of my refrigerator and landed hard, corner first, by my feet.\nBut when I checked, my phone was fine, saved perhaps by hardened glass, dumb luck or my gentle linoleum floor.\nFor Jonna Valente, one half of a caseless couple based in North Carolina in the US, going without a case wasn't about science or status. \"When I got my last phone, my daughter picked out the pink colour, and I didn't want to put a case on it because she just loved it so much,\" she says.\nValente never looked back, and as time went by, she realised living without a case changed her relationship with her phone. \"Because my fingers don't grip it as well, I just have more of an awareness,\" she says. \"It's made me more conscious of the thing, and I find I don't get blindly sucked in as much as I used to. I can't believe I'm saying this but I think I'm actually using my phone less.\"\nAs romantic as Valente makes it sound, I can't say the same. I'm as mindlessly glued to the internet as ever before.\nEarly in my career I worked at the magazine Consumer Reports, which has a full-on laboratory where teams of engineers have designed scientific tests to rate and review the products for almost 90 years. Just down the hall from my office was a crew that has rated phones for decades. To test for durability, Consumer Reports uses violence. If anyone knows the truth, it would be my old colleague Rich Fisco.\n\"We call it the drop test,\" says Fisco, who heads Consumer Reports' electronics testing. Phones go into a three-foot-long metal box with concrete panels at both ends, he says. Then the box spins, 50 times, slamming the phone against the concrete again and again. When the process is over, an engineer examines the device. If it survives, Fisco says they put the phone back in the box and give it yet another 50 drops.\n\"When the drop tests first started, about a third of phones would fail,\" says Fisco. \"We haven't seen a phone fail the drop test in a long time. The glass has improved. These days they seem to be doing a lot better,\" he says.\n\"Look, I'm not saying the screen won't get scratched at some point, and if you drop it just right, or it lands on a little rock, say goodbye. But if your phone falls out of your hip pocket when you're walking down the street, the reality is it's probably not going to break,\" Fisco says. \"It's true, you don'thaveto use a phone case anymore. But the real question is, are you a gambler?\"\nEven though Fisco publishes results that show dozens of phones passing the drop test every year, he still keeps his own device wrapped in a case. \"Of course I do,\" he says. \"I'm cheap.\"\nI was rushing out the door on day 26 of my month with no case. Standing at the top of my building's staircase, I grabbed my phone to check on my commute to work. The next moment is a blur – I was probably being careless – but suddenly my phone was not in my hand but, in fact, tumbling out in front of me. I winced as it bounced down the steps once, twice and three times before clattering to a stop at the foot of the stairs.\nI rushed down to rescue it, and lo and behold, there was a small gash in the corner of my iPhone's aluminium siding. The glass, however, was miraculously unscathed.\nI spent the remaining days of my experiment playing it safe, clutching the phone tight on my rides on the subway, practicing mindfulness whenever I picked it up or set it down and on the whole simply using the thing a bit less.\nMore like this:\n•Inside YouTube's world of forgotten videos\n•What social hobbies taught me about friendship\n•Lost Merlin legend found in cover of another book\nMy friend, on the other hand, wasn't so lucky. The next time we met up in the park, I asked him how his phone was doing. \"Bad,\" he said. \"I dropped it. It's smashed, cracked, the front and the camera lens.\" He was the first to call it ironic. Then again, he has an older iPhone. Maybe the newer ceramic glass would have saved him. Maybe not.\nNo matter how many salt baths they give your screen, glass is breakable. But I'm now convinced that with newer devices – and steadier hands than mine – a case really is optional if you're willing to accept some very real risks. By the end of the month, though, my nerves were shot. I'd been walking a tightrope, and while I'd survived a lot of bumps and drops, every near miss felt like a warning.\nIn the end, I'm back on the case. But every once in a while I still slip it off, just for the thrill, and let my phone feel the wind in its glass.\n* Thomas Germain is a senior technology journalist for the BBC.

    "content": "Scientists are racing to find out what causes this progressive disease. And they're starting to make some headway.\nAfter five and a half years of living with amyotrophic-lateral sclerosis (ALS), actor Kenneth Mitchell – who appeared in the films Star Trek: Discovery and Captain Marvel – died on 24 February 2024. In the months leading up to his death, he had described on social media what it was like living with the disease, which is also known as Lou Gehrig disease after the American baseball player who was diagnosed with the condition in 1939.\n\"It's been a long five years,\" wrote Mitchell in an Instagram post in August 2023. \"So much lost, so much gained. Incredibly hard times, mixed with so many more blessings. At the heart of it all are friends and family, caregivers and doctors coming to the aid of my family over and over and over again. Giving a plethora of support and love and care and encouragement. There is so much beauty in that. This disease is absolutely horrific.\"\nHis death came just a few months after news that photographerBryan Randall had diedin August 2023, who had been diagnosed with ALS three years earlier at the age of 54. He was the partner of the actress Sandra Bullock, who met him on the job while he was taking portraits at a family party. In April 2025,American actor Eric Dane– who starred in Euphoria and Grey's Anatomy – revealed at the age of 52 that he had also been diagnosed with ALS.\nDespite claiming numerous high-profile victims over the years – including young, otherwise healthy people – the mystery of what causes ALS remains. However, recent research has uncovered some clues. Could we finally be on track to decoding this devastating condition?\nALS is a form of motor-neurone disease (MND). It is a debilitating and painful condition in which the motor neurons – cells that control voluntary muscle movement – aregradually lost, leading to people slowly losing control of their bodies. A recent review of the available data estimated that it affects somewhere aroundfive people per 100,000in the US.\nThe disease occurs more commonly in men and the average age of diagnosis is about 60 years old, though it can also affect people who are significantly younger. While most people live only a few years after the diagnosis, there are notable exceptions, including the physicist Stephen Hawking who was diagnosed with aform of MND at 21and died in 2018 at the age of 76.\nThe reasons why people develop ALS are complicated. For 10-15% of people with the condition, itruns in the family. In these cases, a mutation in a particular gene would have been passed through the generations. It is not certain that if one of your parents or ancestors had ALS, you will develop it as well, although there may be stories about cousin Lucy or grandpa Joe having a wasting illness in the family folklore.\nHowever, it turns out that when people do develop the inherited form of ALS, the affected gene is not always the same one, even though the consequences are the same.\nFor the other 85% of people who develop ALS, identifying the cause is even less straightforward. When no-one says \"your great uncle had something like that\" after someone gets a diagnosis for ALS, then it is considered to be a random, one off, event and is called a \"sporadic\" case. Recent research has suggested that genetic mutations might be part of the story. However, these probably involve little changes in a few different genes rather the single drastic, obvious biological mistakes noted for familial ALS. Changes in up to 40 genes have been implicated in increasing someone's risk for sporadic ALS, though the condition is extremely rare.\nDepending on the type of ALS, \"the extent that disease can be explained by genetic factors is only about 8% to 60%,\" explains Eva Feldman, a professor of neurology at the University of Michigan.\nHowever, there's also emerging evidence that repeated andprolonged exposure to potential triggersin the external environment might increase the risk of someone developing ALS, particularly the sporadic form. This led Feldman and her colleagues to investigate.\n\"We suspected the presence of what we term the ALS 'exposome', which is the sum of toxic environmental exposures that increase risk,\" says Feldman. The team have found that prolonged exposure to organic chemical pollutants, metals, pesticides, particulate matter in dust from construction work and poor air quality could contribute toincreasing a person's ALS risk.\nNeil Thakur, chief mission officer of theALS Association, says there is not a complete cause and effect for ALS. \"It is always a combination of factors,\" he says. \"Even if you have a risk factor or the genetic profile, it is not 100% sure you will get ALS.\"\nBut there is some evidence that exposure to particulates fromdiesel fuel, aviation fuel, particulates fromburn pits,pesticidesand aerosols may increase someone's risk of developing ALS, he adds. Military personnel, for example, are highly exposed to these and seem to have an increased chance of contracting the disease, he says.\nThere's also evidence that havingleadin your drinking water,smokingand contact sports might trigger ALS. Still, there remains a lot of uncertainty. Studies assessing the effect of alcohol intake and cigarette smoking over a lifetime before an ALS diagnosis suggest being a teetotal non-smoker doesnot necessarily protect you. (These factors do reduce a person's risk of developing many other conditions, of course – so there are plenty of other reasons to limit yourdrinking and smoking.)\nOne of the challenges that scientists and clinicians investigating the causes of ALS (and MND overall) face is that they are, thankfully, rare diseases. Within the small number of patients, not everyone is willing or able to take part in research studies. And there are many differences in genetics and lifestyle that could be influencing the results. Even if a genetic change is found in 4% of cases, for example, there might not be enough people in that group to see a clear difference between those who have been exposed to a specific chemical pollutant and those who have not.\n\"It takes a long time to fully recruit enough people onto an ALS clinical trial, because the disease progresses so rapidly and people are only eligible early in the disease,\" says Thakur. \"If you do have ALS in your family and you have an ALS gene, you can explore whether you could participate in trials, which would help you and others.\"\nFeldman also says that her team's research looking at the combined risk from genetic and environmental factors \"is a challenge\" because they suspect that multiple genes – tens and possibly even hundreds – contribute to what they term the \"polygenic risk profile\" in ALS. This risk profile comes \"in addition to traditional risk from single genes\", she says. The team is now investigating how this polygenic risk profile might interact with environmental factors to cause ALS.\nAt the moment, ALS can't be cured. But the Food and Drug Administration has approved several treatments which can help toslow the speedof its progression and give people a little more time. These drugs have arange of mechanisms, ranging from reducing the levels of certain chemicals around the brain and spinal cord to preventing nerve cell death.\nThere also seems to be the possibility that targeting treatments against the effects of a particular faulty gene could be useful. A recent early trial of a drug designed to counteract the damage done by the SOD1 mutation produced somepromising preliminary results, for example.\nKnowing which genetic mutations might have been responsible for a person's diagnosis of ALS may not be particularly comforting to someone currently experiencing it. The focus of the ALS Association is to providesupport and guidancefor people with the condition and their families.\n\"The ALS Association strategy is to make it liveable until we have a cure,\" says Thakur. The organisation advocates for high quality care involving healthcare professionals from a range of different backgrounds, which can allow someone to have a more active life for a few months longer, he says. The association also plans to release guidance on how to reduce risk from potential contributors to the development of ALS, he says.\nThe challenge, however, is funding for appropriate research. As well as working out how much of a contribution each gene or environmental factor might make, more studies are needed on how to apply any knowledge gained. \"The real question is not why do people get ALS, but what can we do to prevent it or treat it?\" says Thakur.\nRegardless of the cause, the march of thisprogressive diseasewill continue. Family and friends will have to respond to each new level of deterioration with love and patience, asSandra Bullock has done. However, a better understanding of the science behind this devastating condition will hopefully lead to more effective treatments and, one day, may even help to prevent new cases emerging. And that is always welcome.\n* This article was originally published 27 August 2023.

    "content": "Video games are the biggest form of entertainment in the world, but sometimes they bleed into people's lives offline in surprising and disturbing ways.\nChristian Dines' hands were twitching. As though he were still gripping his video game controller, about to make a killer move. But the game was switched off and his hands were free. The US-based sustainability advisor had also noticed how, when he glanced at objects in his room, he felt an urge to absorb or \"collect\" them, like weapons or power-ups in his game.\nHe swallowed hard. \"I thought, 'what the hell is this?' It was something I'd never experienced before as a gamer,\" he says. After a week of playing the same game maybe two or three hours a day, Dines' virtual experience was spilling over, disturbingly, into reality.\n\"It all only lasted a couple of days, but the effect was disorientating,\" he recalls. \"It's unnerving to be distracted in some way by a screen when you're no longer in front of it.\"\nDines had, it seems, experienced something calledGame Transfer Phenomenon, a condition in which the physical world and video games bleed together. While this might not be very common, for gamers who experience it, the condition can be extremely unsettling. And potentially even dangerous.\nThe term Game Transfer Phenomenon, or GTP, was first coined by Angelica Ortiz de Gortari, a psychologist at the University of Bergen in Norway. She first proposed the concept a decade ago while working on herdoctoral thesisunder the supervision of Mark Griffiths, head of Nottingham Trent University's International Gaming Research Unit. Ortiz de Gortari was motivated by her own experience of GTP. One day, she was walking around her local supermarket and realised that she was imagining peering at products on the shelves through a rifle scope.\n\"I thought, 'Wow! This is interesting',\" she recalls. \"A phenomenon that changes your perception by encouraging you to see objects through the lens of the game you're playing,\" she says, adding that her response had felt involuntary, leaving her with serious questions about what it meant.\nBut what exactly is GTP? Ortiz de Gortari suggests that one could compare it to potentially more common experiences such asear-worms, in which you spend days trying to get a catchy song out of your head. Or when images from a television show you binge-watched keep popping up in your mind's eye. With GTP, though, theintensity is arguably dialledup, says Ortiz de Gortari. Not least becausegaming activates brain areas associated with control inhibition– the ability, or not, to control one's thoughts and behaviour rather than acting on impulse.This can also occur while passively watching television, but to a lesser degree than while gaming.\nOrtiz de Gortari's studies suggestthat GTP inducesdistress and dysfunction for around half of those gamers who say they have experienced it, with confusion, hyper-vigilance and irrationality among the symptoms. For others the only notable response may be a feeling of embarrassment that their game-play has spilled over into \"real life\".\nOne study participant she interviewed reported seeinghealth indicator bars like those in the role-playing game World of Warcraftfloating above their companions' heads. Another spoke of lapses in concentration after not being able to stop \"seeing\" images from a game. Others said colours in the real world seemed transformed, and began to mimic the colours of a game world they had recently played in. While such effects are usually transitory, GTP can provoke a startling array of spontaneous or involuntary effects, according to Ortiz de Gortari's research.\nWhile rare, these effects can eventake the formof involuntary physical actions and behaviours. A game could end up shaping the way one interacts with real world objects or people. For example, a walk down a supermarket aisle could be experienced through the lens of gameplay, with the player perhaps \"shooting\" at products or people, possibly with a corresponding involuntary physical action in the hands as though working console controls.\nIn total, Ortiz de Gortari has recorded GTP experiences among gamers related to more than 400 titles of all kinds. Her largest on the subject to date,published in 2024, involved the participation of 623 Chinese gamers, both male and female. The results suggest that between 82% and 96% of those gamers have experienced some form of GTP.\nIt's possible that some gamers might have endured episodes of GTP but never admitted this to anyone, for fear of being considered \"crazy\", says Ortiz de Gortari. It is time we demystified GTP, she argues. \"The mission for me is to inform people about the phenomenon, to raise awareness, because the [gamers] I've spoken to about it have been very concerned,\" she says. \"Often, people don't want to talk about the experience of, say, seeing things that aren't there with their open eyes – even if that's what happens – because that's to talk about hallucinations, and they're associated with [potentially taboo, severe] mental illness.\"\nOrtiz de Gortari argues that GTP has become a more common experience as games, especially role-playing, simulation, adventure and first-person shooter games, have become increasingly realistic and immersive. They offer sprawling environments full of detail and interaction. Essentially, gamers end up living virtual lives through such media and can find the gameplay deeply affecting.\n\"The more realistic the video game world is, the more likely players are to confuse the game world and the real world,\" says Ortiz de Gortari, who adds that this could mean GTP is becoming more common and impactful. The sophistication of games has undoubtedly increased since the days of Tetris and Super Mario, she points out. \"Essentially the sophistication of the game facilitates the experience outside of the game.\"\nAli Farha, a gaming industry commentator and senior game producer at Stockholm-based Star Stable Entertainment, has experienced GTP himself. He describes his case as \"a pretty harmless sense of gameplay repeating offline\". He suggests that regular breaks during extended stretches of play and a period of conscious decompression after a long gaming session – reading a book or watching some light TV – could help counteract the likelihood of GTP raising its head.\nPlaying time – particularly above four hours – does appear to be akey factor in the onset of GTP. That's one reason why Scott Jennings, spokesperson for the US-basedGaming Addicts Anonymous (GAA), whose members invariably are at the high-end of playing hours, says the support group is increasingly mindful of this potential side-effect of gaming.\nFarha also says that few people currently appreciate that, as he believes, the bridge between the real and the virtual is actually a two-way street.\n\"We overlook that we also take the experiences and expectations of the real world into the game world – and that too can be disorientating,\" he says. \"I think it's quite common to enter a multi-player online game and feel loneliness, for example, even though you know you're at home. The experiences we have online become part of our personality. We build memories inside the virtual space of the games we play too, in the same way we build memories in the real world.\" In fact,studies suggestthat games can bemore conducive to memory formationthan real life.\n\"I think for a lot of players the virtual and real worlds are starting to blur,\" Farha adds.\nWhile no-one has reported physical harm as a consequence of GTP to date – GTP could, in principle, endanger someone. \"It's not a good idea for me to be trying to kill demons while I'm driving,\" as Dines puts it.\nExactly why the virtual world can blur with the real world in this way, however, is still not clear. Some studies suggestdifferent brain networks are activatedwhen observing something in a virtual environment, compared to a real one. The same has beenfound with objects in augmented reality, where virtual elements are superimposed onto the real world. But some studies have shown thathuman memory can sometimes struggleto recall whether something occurred in a virtual environment or in real life – with the effects being more pronounced when using virtual reality systems.\nOrtiz de Gortari has indicated that GTP might be more common among gamers who have a tendency formind-wandering and have a low working memory capacity. She also believes it could be the result of the gamepriming the brain or some sort of associated learning effectthat when gamers encounter something similar to an environment or scene they came across in a game, it can trigger an involuntary response.\nBut these are all theories for now.\n\"The human brain isn't built to differentiate between reality and today's virtual worlds,\" says a spokesperson for Game Addicts Anonymous. \"That's one reason why games are so captivating and why it's no surprise the two experiences overlap.\"\nJennings also recounts a GTP-like experience. After playing an aggressive racing game he later felt \"a disconcerting urge\" when out driving, to smash into a vehicle that pulled up alongside him. He argues that GTP could be compared to alcoholism. It's not necessarily about how many drinks you've had but rather it's about your personal relationship to alcohol. Similarly, he says, while most people may have a functional relationship to gaming, some players are less able to contain its effect to playing time.\nRecent research by Ortiz de Gortari would appear to back this up. Her findings suggests that certainpersonality traits are likely a factorinone's propensity towards GTP. Other influences she cites include suffering fromsleep deprivation, stress, depression or anxiety.\nMax Dzmitryiev, a US-based counsellor and gamer, says he grew up experiencing symptoms of anxiety. Video games, he says, offered an escape from reality.\n\"But I'd easily get immersed in them,\" he recalls. \"And as the level of immersion grew, so the stimulation was higher and so I had more GTP experiences,\" he says. To him, GTP is \"freaky and unpleasant\" and something that can overwhelm his thoughts and decisions for as long as 20 minutes. After such a bout, GTP can keep popping up for days, intermittently, he explains.\nDzmitryiev has even noticed that watching someone else play a game can induce GTP-style effects. He gives the example of observing someone having fun in Minecraft, a colourful exploration and world-building game. Watching the other person's progress intently can lead to Dzmitryiev to, he says, literally perceiving his own surroundings as though they were built from the cube-like blocks used to construct the virtual environments in Minecraft. This effect – like an involuntary visual overlay to his surroundings – can last for an hour or so, he says. \"It's why I tend to stay away from VR games now – because I still feel fully immersed for too long after taking the headset off,\" he says.\nIt raises questions about whether the games industry should be addressing GTP in some way? Since so many games are played by children and young people, Ortiz de Gortari argues that developers should take more responsibility in addressing the potential impact of GTP on susceptible gamers, possibly through their own research, or at least by acknowledging its effects.\nDines says that he would endorse some kind of warning on games. It may only have relevance for a few gamers but that's no different to the warnings about strobe lighting effects, which could induce epileptic seizures in a small subset of players, for example.\n\"Game developers intentionally craft their products to give certain experiences – they know their game's power,\" says Farha. \"Players need to appreciate that games have to be used correctly. I know I've played too much at times and it didn't make me feel good.\"\nBut Nick Ballou, a postdocoral researcher in video games and mental health at the University of Oxford, expresses concern that overemphasising the dangers of GTP will fuel the moral panic around video games or stoke fears that all games are inherently unhealthy. Ballou is currently in the process of analysing data shared with him by the gaming industry. This data covers five leading video game platforms and his goal is to provide the most nuanced picture to date of how games affect people, both for better or worse. He aims to publish the first research from this project this spring.\nMore like this:\n•Why children love Minecraft so much\n•The mysterious origins of an uncrackable video game\n•The people who 'see' foreign languages\nMost gamers don't find that their hobby impacts their mental health negatively, he says. Rather, they more commonly report that gaming induces feelings of relief or relaxation, and that it gives them access to communities or offers a sense of achievement and identity. \"Any problems are at the extremes [of gaming],\" says Ballou. \"[Similarly], in small doses, GTP doesn't strike me as particularly problematic. If it was endemic we'd see more people out there behaving in very strange ways. But we don't.\"\nFor Ortiz de Gortari, however, there's a lot still to uncover about this extraordinary phenomenon. We still know relatively little about the way gamers unconsciously process what they see and hear during play. A better understanding of this, through a complex and expensive brain scan study, might, she says, help us unravel what happens as GTP kicks in.\n\"We have enough evidence that GTP is happening,\" she says. \"Now we need to know more about how and why.\"\nFor more technology news and insights, sign up to ourTech Decoded newsletter, whileThe Essential Listdelivers a handpicked selection of features and insights to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "summary": "The creation of three dire wolf pups has raised hopes that it may be possible to resurrect extinct animals. But some scientists have grave concerns.",
    "content": "The creation of three \"dire wolf\" pups has raised hopes that it may be possible to resurrect extinct animals. But some scientists have grave concerns.\nWhen news broke that Colossal Biosciences, a Dallas-based biotechnology company, hadresurrected three extinct dire wolves, the internet reacted with awe. It is a species that last roamed the earth some 13,000 years ago, but has found recent fame thanks to Game of Thrones, which features fictional dire wolves.\nThe story was stoked further when a photograph of Game of Thrones author George R R Martin holding one of the adorable white pups was released. \"I have to say the rebirth of the direwolf has stirred me as no scientific news has since Neil Armstrong [walked] on the moon,\"Martin wrote on his blog.\nMartin, who is an investor in Colossal, added that more extinct species were on the way, including the woolly mammoth, Tasmanian tiger and dodo.\nColossal – which is currently valued at $10bn (£7.6bn) and is backed by high-profile donors such as Chris Hemsworth, Paris Hilton and the CIA – boldly states on its website that it's \"going to fix\" the problem of extinction.\nAccording to Matt James, the company's chief animal officer, the aim is not to create a Jurassic Park-like zoo full of extinct animals, but to reintroduce lost species back into the habitats they once occupied. Once those animals are settled in, Colossal expects them to exert positive change on their habitats. \"We're trying to focus on species that can have cascading effects on an ecosystem to improve stability, lift biodiversity and maybe even help with climate change buffering,\" James tells the BBC.\nDe-extinction has been talked aboutfor decades. But Colossal's three dire wolves – whichare actually grey wolvesthat possess 20 edited genes that are meant to give them dire wolf-like features – represent the most serious effort to date to make that lofty vision a reality.\nIn the wake of the dire wolf announcement, however, many scientists have criticised Colossal's approach. They see efforts to bring back long-extinct species as costly wastes of resources and a distraction from the significant work that's needed to save still-living species.\nThe BBC spoke with several experts in fields ranging from conservation biology to paleontology about efforts to resurrect species from extinction and whether they are likely to achieve the goals that Colossal hopes.\nChief among the concerns raised was that claiming it is possible to bring back extinct species may actually lead to more existing species being lost. It could give politicians and industries the idea that damage to the environment can be fixed by resurrecting species.\nSuch a message could be particularly damaging at a time when the US is withdrawing frominternational agreements on climate changeandrevoking measuresintendedprotect the environment and wildlife, says David Shiffman, a marine conservation biologist and independent consultant based in Washington, DC.\n\"It's beyond irresponsible for these people [Colossal] to be claiming some sort of conservation victory in this environment,\" he says.\nThis worry was quickly reinforced when Doug Burgum, the US Secretary of the Interior – who the Colossal team met with in advance of their dire wolf announcement –praised the company's workon X as a new \"bedrock for modern species conservation\". Burgum also criticised the ineffectiveness of the \"endangered species list\" – presumably a reference to theRed List of Threatened Species, drawn up by the International Union of Conservation (IUCN) or the list of threatened & endangered species maintained by branches of the US Government – thanks to what he characterised as a focus on regulation. \"Since the dawn of our nation, it has been innovation – not regulation – that has spawned American greatness,\" he wrote.\nBiodiversity is under a seemingly endless onslaught of threats, virtually all of which are imposed by humans. The leading reasons,according to the IUCN, are habitat destruction, invasive species, overexploitation from fishing and hunting, illegal wildlife trade, pollution and climate change.\nColossal claims that its de-extinction work willdirectly benefit conservation. But the company needs to tie its work to \"ameliorating, alleviating or reversing something that's on that list\" of threats to biodiversity, says Kent Redford, former director of the Wildlife Conservation Society who now works as an independent conservation consultant in Portland, Maine.\nWhile Colossal's de-extinction work is \"super-cool science,\" he continues, he does not see it alleviating any of the threats highlighted by the IUCN.\nColossal sees things otherwise. The company states on its website that woolly mammoths reintroduced to the Arctic, for example, will increase those habitats'resilience to climate changethrough their foraging behavior, which they say will help to keep carbon locked in permafrost in the ground. By scraping away snow, the company says, mammoths will expose the soil below to cold air, causing it to stay frozen.\nHowever, Nitin Sekar, a conservation scientist with the Asian elephant specialist group at the IUCN, says he has struggled to find evidence in the scientific literature to support this claim. One study comparingcarbon storage in the Arctic tundra to taiga forestfound the soil in areas covered in trees could store nearly twice as much carbon overall. Only slightly more was found in the permafrost of the tundra than in the taiga. Nor could he find anything else about how mammoths might have affected carbon in general.\nSome research on existing species of arctic herbivores suggests that they canreduce permafrost thawing. One scoping study by researchers at the University of Oxford does point to the role mammoths had on the climate during the Pleistocene and suggestsbison and horsescould replicate some of that role. But those species need to be maintained athigh densities– where they are fenced, fed and managed by humans – to have any protective effect. The Arctic ecosystem is alsodifferent todaythan it was in the Pleistocene, so it is also hard to say whether mammoth hybrids would have that same effect on today's landscape as species like caribou and reindeer.\nThere could be other ways that mammoths affect carbon levels. As temperatures increase, the act of trampling and scraping away snow could actually accelerate permafrost melting by exposing it to the Sun – an effect thatsome research suggestsis already happening in wet lowlands in the Arctic.\n\"Overall, with the data we have now, it's just impossible to know how mammoths affected their environment millennia ago, or how the mammoth-elephant hybrids will behave in our warmer future,\" Sekar says. \"It seems like a strange thing to gamble on in the face of an existential crisis, given the alternatives.\"\nJames calls for more research to resolve these questions and show \"direct links and causation in a way that can help to bring the rest of the scientific community along on this journey\".\nDire wolves and woolly mammoths were driven extinct by the complex forces of a changing planet, not just by human activities. For species that humans are responsible for annihilating, though, simply bringing them back does not help to address the threats that pushed them to extinction in the first place, says Corinne Kendall, programme director for Southern Africa at the Peregrine Fund, a non-profit organisation that aims to conserve birds of prey around the world.\nModern conservationists recognise this and are increasingly focused on landscape-level solutions rather than saving a particular favourite species, Kendall adds.\n\"That's what's missing in the way Colossal is approaching this,\" she says. \"If you only address the genetics and technology side of things, it's interesting from a scientific discovery standpoint, but you're creating the trees without the forest.\"\nJulie Meachen, a vertebrate paleontologist and morphologist at Des Moines University in Iowa, believes, however, that the genetic techniques Colossal used to create its dire wolves are applicable to conservation. The company is also exploring ways to help still-living species such as thenorthern white rhino, elephants and endangered pigeons, she points out. \"These techniques could be applied to any species suffering from genetic diversity loss and to combat inbreeding or genetic bottlenecks in low population sizes,\" she says.\n\"I think the conservation work that Colossal is doing is far more important than the de-extinction work, but this conservation work does not get the same press coverage as the flashy de-extinction part,\" she adds. \"That is unfortunate.\"\nJames at Colossal agrees that de-extinction technologies are just \"one piece of a very complex puzzle\" that must also include things like habitat protection. But he says that attention-grabbing headlines about extinct species being brought back to life can act like \"a giant ship\" pulling \"all these other projects in its wake\".\nIt is also important to be clear about what Colossal is actually able to achieve. It is unlikely to ever be possible to truly resurrect long-gone species like dire wolves or woolly mammoths, say scientists not involved with the company. Tissue samples from animals that have been extinct for tens of thousands of years lack the intact cells needed for traditional cloning techniques, says Jacquelyn Gill, a paleoecologist at the University of Maine. \"What Colossal is engaging in is genetic modification of modern species to give them physical characteristics to make them look like extinct species.\"\nThis in itself is a significant technical achievement, argues Colossal and its supporters.\nIn the case of the dire wolves, the three puppies it managed to breed are in reality \"genetically modified grey wolves\", say researchers. Essentially the genome of modern wolves was edited to replicate small segments of ancient DNA obtained from the fossilised remains of dire wolves. They are, the company admits, grey wolves with dire wolf characteristics.\nBut scientists have even questioned some of those characteristics.It's unlikely, for example, that dire wolves would have been white, but Colossal chose to make its animals white \"because of popular conceptions from Game of Thrones\", Gill says. \"This was an aesthetic choice, not a biological or scientific one.\"\nEven if Colossal did bring back animals that very closely resembled Ice Age species, they still would not be the same as the bona fide ones that lived thousands of years ago because the Pleistocene ecosystem they inhabited no longer exists, Meachen says. \"A dire wolf or any other species is not only its genes, but also its environment and all the other species living there.\"\nColossal says it has no plans of releasing dire wolves into the wild. But it does aspire to eventually repopulate parts of the Arctic with woolly mammoths. This would require engineering a lot of baby mammoth proxies, which the company plans to do by using Asian or African elephants as surrogates.\nIn the West especially, though, some people are starting to question the ethics of whether elephants – extremely intelligent, social and sentient beings –should be kept in captivity at all, much less be experimented on, Sekar says. Asian elephants in modern zoo facilities also frequentlysuffer from infertility and lose their calvesto stillbirths and infanticides twice as often as elephants in semi-wild conditions, he says, while mothersdeeply mourn dead calves. \"Are we really ok putting elephants through that so we can have these visually entertaining animals that aren't even real mammoths?\" asks Sekar.\nJames says that Colossal will have many quality control steps to ensure things go well for the elephants, and that the company will also be working with leading animal welfare experts to \"avoid potential welfare pitfalls ahead\".\nColossal has not disclosed how much it invested in the dire wolf programme – but it's likely in the many millions of dollars. While costs of new technologies do eventually go down with scale, even if de-extinction does get cheaper, it will still be orders of magnitude more affordable and effective to stop species from going extinct in the first place, Shiffman says. Moreover, if the original drivers of extinction are not addressed, then de-extinct species could quickly become re-extinct, he warns.\nWhile Redford acknowledges that money is not fungible, if Colossal's primary goal really is conservation, then he says he has a hard time viewing its work on de-extinction as being \"the right investment to make\".\nFor every extinct species that Colossal is bringing back, however, James says the company is also investing in a surviving endangered species. Work is being done to introduce greater genetic diversity to populations of endangered red wolves in the US, for example, and to engineer elephants to be resistant to herpes virus.\nBut while red wolves do have some issues with genetic diversity, theirbiggest threatsareroad collisions and human persecution, Kendall says. Without addressing \"how the animal is going to survive on the ground\", the genetic component becomes \"kind of irrelevant\".\nHerpes also only kills a fraction of the number of wild Asian elephants each year compared to those killed by humans, says Sekar, who is planning to publish data from the Indian government about causes of elephant deaths. Around eight wild elephants die per year of herpes compared to around 100 killed in some way by humans, he says.\nColossal could leverage its synthetic biology expertise in ways that are clear wins for the planet, experts say. Crops that are engineered to more efficiently take up nitrogen, for example, could be a huge boon for reducing the steep climate costs of nitrogen fertiliser and lessening the major dead zones that its runoffs cause in water bodies. Finding ways toengineer high quality animal proteins for human consumptioncould, likewise, be a game-changer for alleviating the many environmental and animal welfare concerns that plague the livestock industry, the experts say.\n\"Colossal clearly has very talented biologists on their team,\" Sekar says. \"If they were to turn their attention to addressing problems like that, they could really be the heroes of conservation.\"\nFor essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to theFuture Earth newsletter,whileThe Essential Listdelivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86je4vyg36o",
    "section": "innovation",
    "summary": "Australia has proposed to create a strategic reserve of critical minerals.",
    "content": "Australia's prime minister Anthony Albanese has pledged to invest A$1.2bn (£580m) in a strategic reserve for critical minerals if he wins next month's election, as trade tensions escalate.\nThe announcement came after China imposed export restrictions on seven rare earth elements, essential to the production of advanced technologies - including electric vehicles, fighter jets, and robots.\nChina's controls apply to all countries but were widely seen asretaliation to US President Donald Trump's tariffs.\nAlbanese said Australia would prioritise minerals that are key to its security, and that of its partners, including rare earths. But could his plan challenge China's dominance?\nRare earths are a group of 17 elements - named \"rare\" because they are notoriously difficult to extract and refine.\nRare earths, like samarium and terbium, are critical to the production of technologies set to shape the world in the coming decades – including electric vehicles and highly advanced weapons systems.\nAlbanese's proposed reserve includes rare earths as well as other critical minerals of which Australia is a top producer - like lithium and cobalt.\nBoth China and Australia have rare earth reserves. But 90% of rare earth refining – which makes them usable in technology – takes place in China, giving the country significant control over supply.\nAnd that has spooked Western governments.\nBeijing said its restrictions on rare earths were in response to Trump's sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports to the US, currently at 145%.\nBut analysts say Washington's inability to secure the supply of rare earths has become one of the Trump administration's chief anxieties, especially as diplomatic tensions with Beijing have deepened.\nAround 75% of US rare earth imports came from China between 2019 and 2022, according to the US Geological Survey.\nPhilip Kirchlechner, director of Iron Ore Research in Perth, Western Australia, told the BBC that the US and EU had \"dropped the ball\" on recognising the importance of the rare earths over recent decades, as China swiftly developed a monopoly over refinement.\n\"China has its foot on the blood vein… of US and European defence systems,\" he added.\nElon Musk, CEO of Tesla, this week said that China halting exports of rare earths used in advanced magnets was affecting the company's ability to develop humanoid robots, in an early symbol of the pain Beijing has the power to inflict on US companies.\nAlbanese's proposal says that minerals in the reserve will be available to both \"domestic industry and international partners\", in a likely reference to allies such as the US and EU.\nBut Kirchlechner, while welcoming the move as \"long overdue\", added that the proposal is \"not going to solve the problem\".\nThe fundamental issue is that even if Australia stockpiles more critical minerals, the refining process of rare earths will still largely be controlled by China.\nLithium – not a rare earth, but a crucial metal in the production electric vehicle batteries and solar panels – is a good example. Australia mines 33% of the world's lithium, but only refines and exports a tiny fraction. China, on the other hand, mines just 23% of the world's lithium, but refines 57% of it, according to the International Energy Agency.\nAustralia has been investing in refining rare earths as part of its Future Made in Australia plan, aimed at leveraging the country's critical minerals reserves to drive the green transition.\nArafura Rare Earths, headquartered in Perth, Western Australia, last year received A$840m in funding to create the country's first combined mine and refinery for rare earths. And in November, Australia opened its first rare earths processing plant, also in Western Australia, operated by Lynas Rare Earths.\nBut the country is expected to depend on China for refining until at least 2026, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, headquartered in Washington.\nChina has been trying to seize on the volatility brought by Trump.\nIn a series of editorials in Australian newspapers, China's ambassador to Canberra lambasted Washington's approach to global trade, and called on Australia to \"join hands\" with Beijing - something that Albanese quickly rejected.\nAustralia has touted its resource industry in its talks with Trump. Some critical minerals were exempt from a 10% tariff he imposed on imports of most Australian products.\nBut analysts say Albanese's proposal is mainly aimed at protecting Australia and its partners from strategic adversaries like China.\nAlicia García-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis, told the BBC that Albanese's plan was \"more sophisticated\" than previous proposals, because it included the ability to sell Australia's resources at moments of economic tension.\nIf China imposes export controls, she added, Australia could begin selling more of its mineral reserves to help lower prices on global markets, and loosen the control China has had on setting prices.\nBut she said that Australia still cannot completely replace China.\n\"If [Australia's] goal is to serve the West, become more instrumental to the West – especially the US – there are weak spots China can enter – and the most important is refining.\""

When contacted by the BBC,  The Atlantic had no comment.\nThe interview comes a month after Mr Goldberg published a story about being added to a secret group chat on the encrypted texting app Signal. In the text chain, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and other top US officials discussed the details of an upcoming attack against the Houthis.\nThe scandal rocked the White House. Then, in April, the New York Times and others reported that Hegseth had shared information about the same military action in a second private Signal group chat, which included his wife, brother and personal lawyer.\nTrump has continued to stand by his defence secretary and others involved in the incident, telling reporters earlier this week: \"Pete's doing a great job ... Everybody's happy with him.\"\nHegseth's wife, Jennifer Rauchet, is a former Fox News producer and holds no official position within the Pentagon.\nHis brother, Phil, and personal lawyer Tim Parlatore, both hold positions at the Department of Defense. But it is not clear why any of the three would require advanced warnings about sensitive US strike plans.\nThe White House repeatedly has played down the scandals, claiming no \"classified\" information was shared with the Atlantic editor in the first chat. That thread included information about the exact timings of the air strikes as well as the weaponry being used, before the attack had taken place."

    "content": "The UK's Eurovision hopefuls, Remember Monday, have covered a song from Will Ferrell's cult movie about the contest, as the finals draw closer.\nThe trio travelled to Iceland earlier this month to filmtheir version of Húsavík (My Hometown), originally sung by Rachel McAdams' character Sigrit in the Netflix spoof, The Story Of Fire Saga.\nIt's released just three weeks before the band perform their own song, What The Hell Just Happened, at this year's Eurovision Song Contest in Basel, Switzerland.\nBookmakers predict that the UK will fall just outside the top 10 in the contest, with Sweden and Austria among the favourites to win.\nHowever, Remember Monday told BBC News that they're \"hungry to get a good result\".\n\"We feel like there's a little bit of a stigma around Eurovision, and we'd really love to be a part of changing it,\" said singer Holly-Anne Hull.\nThe group, completed by Charlotte Steele and Lauren Byrne, started singing together in school, and went on to have starring roles in West End shows like Les Misérables, Phantom Of The Opera and Six: The Musical.\nAs long-standing Eurovision fans, they've thrown themselves into a whirlwind European press tour, performing in about a dozen countries, and even singing on a Swiss mountaintop.\nFor their journey to Húsavík, Steele even confronted her fear of flying by travelling in both a propellor plane and a helicopter.\nThe trip fulfilled \"a long-time dream of ours\", the band said.\nIn the music video, they get to visit the charming Elf Houses that form part of the country's magical folklore, and sing with a choir of Icelandic schoolgirls who previously performed at the 2021 Oscars, when Húsavík (My Hometown) was nominated for best original song.\n\"We're very honoured that they welcomed us into their beautiful town and let us sing that song,\" said the band, \"and we're grateful that it's on film so we can relive those memories forever\".\n\"We've never seen anywhere as beautiful with our own eyes!\"\nAhead of Eurovision, the BBC has announced a one-off special, featuring Graham Norton in conversation with Remember Monday.\nThe programme will be broadcast on Friday 9 May on BBC One, giving a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the band's preparations for Basel.\nSeparately, BBC Radio 2 has revealed that Sara Cox is joining the station's presenting line-up for this year's contest.\nThe broadcaster will commentate on the semi-finals alongside Richie Anderson. Scott Mills and Rylan will host the grand final on 17 May.\nRehearsals for the contest start today (25 April) at the Jakobshalle arena.\nIn the initial stages, stand-ins perform the 37 entries, allowing participants to review staging, choreography and lighting cues before contestants arrive in Switzerland at the start of May.\nLast year's contest was won by Swiss singer Nemo for their song The Code - a semi-operatic pop song that charted their journey to realising they were non-binary.\nThis year's favourite is Swedish entrant KAJ, whose song Bara Bada Bastu is an ode to the benefits of the sauna.\nIf they emerge victorious, Sweden will record its eighth win - breaking a tie with Ireland as Eurovision's most-successful nation."

    "content": "A Dutch town hall has admitted that it \"most likely\" accidentally disposed of 46 artworks, including an Andy Warhol print of the former Dutch queen, during renovation works last year.\nMaashorst municipality said the works, including a 1980s silkscreen print of Queen Beatrix worth about €15,000 (£12,800), disappeared during work on a town hall last year.\nAn investigation said the artworks were stored in a basement during renovations and a lack of guidelines for storing the artworks could have been among the reasons why they ended up being thrown away.\nMayor Hans van der Pas told public broadcaster Omroep Brabant: \"That's not how you treat valuables. But it happened. We regret that.\"\nA statement by the municipality on Thursday said the artworks were put into storage during work on a town hall in Uden - which is being incorporated into the neighbouring municipality of Landerd to form the Maashorst municipality.\n\"It's most likely that the artworks were accidentally taken away with the trash,\" they said.\nA report by investigators found that some of the artworks were stored in wheelie bins in the basement and were \"not handled with care\", according to daily newspaper Algemeen Dagblad.\nThe report concluded: \"Ownership was not properly established, no policies and procedures were established regarding the renovation and insufficient action was taken when the artworks turned out to be missing.\"\nIt went on to say that a lack of guidelines for registration, storage, conservation and security of the artworks, were also contributing factors.\nLocal media reports that the 46 artworks altogether were worth around €22,000 (£18,800) and the Maashorst municipality said it was unlikely they will ever be found.\nQueen Beatrix reigned as queen of the Netherlands from 1980 until she abdicated in 2013, when she was succeeded by her son King Willem-Alexander.\nThe Queen Beatrix print was part of Warhol's series Reigning Queens, which comprised of 16 colourful prints of four monarchs, including the late Queen Elizabeth II, Margrethe II of Denmark - who abdicated in 2023 - and Queen Ntombi Twala of Eswatini, previously known as Swaziland.\nWarhol, considered one of the greatest artists of the 20th Century, created the prints in 1985 - two years before his death.\nIn November last year, Warhol prints of Queen Beatrix and Ntombi Twala were stolen - and abandoned - duringa heist on a Dutch art gallery.\nLocal police at the time said thieves took four silkscreen prints from the MPV Gallery in the North Brabant province and fled by car.\nBut the portraits of Queen Beatrix and Queen Ntombi were later abandoned because they did not fit in the vehicle, NOS reported at the time."

    "content": "The Netherlands, March 2025. Yungblud is leaving his hotel in Amsterdam when he's approached by a fan in floods of tears.\n\"You saved my life,\"she sobs.\n\"No, you saved your own life,\" he replies, quietly. \"Maybe the music was the soundtrack, but you saved your own life, OK?\"\nLeaning in for a hug, he adds, \"Don't be sad, be happy. I love ya.\"\nIt's a remarkably touching moment, full of compassion and devoid of rock star ego.\nTwo weeks later, after a video of the encounter goes viral, Yungblud is still moved by the memory.\n\"I didn't think people would see that, except me and her,\" he says, \"but it was such a moment for me.\"\nThe interaction crystallised something he'd felt for a while.\n\"I always said that Bowie and My Chemical Romance saved my life, but ultimately you have to find yourself,\" he says.\n\"Like this morning, I put my headphones on and I listened to [The Verve's] Lucky Man, and it made me go, 'Oh, I'm ready to face the day'.\n\"But Richard Ashcroft didn't tell me I was ready to face the day. I said that to myself.\n\"That's what I was trying to tell that girl in Amsterdam.\"\nSelf-assurance is a lesson he learned the hard way.\nOn the surface, Yungblud, aka 27-year-old Dominic Harrison, had it all. Two number one albums, an international fanbase,a Louis Theroux documentaryand enough clout to run his own festival.\nBut if you looked more closely, there were chinks in the armour. Those number one albums both fell out of the Top 30 after one week, a sign of a strong core fanbase, with limited crossover appeal.\nAnd the first year of his Bludfest in Milton Keynes was criticised afterlong queues and a lack of watercaused fans to pass out and miss the concert.\nHarrison was keenly aware of it all. As he released his self-titled third album in 2022, he hit a low.\n\"Yungblud was number one in seven countries, and I wasn't happy because it wasn't the album I wanted to make,\" he says.\n\"It was a good album, but it wasn't exceptional.\"\nThe problem, he says, was a record label who'd pushed him in a more commercial direction. But in polishing his sound, he lost the angry unpredictability that characterised his best work.\n\"It's funny, my-self titled album was actually the one where I was most lost,\" he observes.\n\"I felt like I compromised but, because of that, I was never taking no for an answer again.\"\nNowhere is that clearer than on his comeback single,Hello Heaven, Hello.\nOver nine minutes and six seconds it achieves Caligulan levels of excess, full of scorching guitar solos, throat-shredding vocal runs, and even an orchestral coda.\n\"Do you still remember, or have you forgotten where you're from?\" Harrison asks himself, as he re-ignites his ambition.\nThe song's purposefully unsuited to radio – unlike the follow-up single, Lovesick Lullaby. Released today, it's a free-associating rampage through a messy night out, that ends with epiphany in a drug dealer's apartment.\nCombining Liam Gallagher's sneer with Beach Boys' harmonies, it's uniquely Yungblud. But the singer reveals it was originally written for his last album.\n\"We were actually discouraged from doing it,\" he says.\n\"My advisor at the time, a guy called Nick Groff [vice president of A&R at Interscope, responsible for signing Billie Eilish], was like, 'I don't get it'.\"\nWarming to the theme, he continues: \"The music industry is crap because it's all about money but, as an artist, I need to make sure that anything I put out is exciting and unlimited.\n\"It can't be like a 50% version of me.\"\nTo achieve that, he shunned expensive recording studios and made his new album in a converted Tetley brewery in Leeds.\nProfessional songwriters were banished, too, in favour of a close group of collaborators, including guitarist Adam Warrington, and Matt Schwartz, the Israeli-British producer who helmed his 2018 debut.\n\"When you make an album in LA or London, everything is great, even if it's mediocre, because people want a hit out of it,\" he argues.\n\"When you make an album with family, all they want is the truth.\"\nOne of the most honest tracks on the record is Zombie, a lighters-aloft ballad (think Coldplay, sung by Bruce Springsteen) about \"feeling you're ugly, and learning to battle that\".\n\"I always was insecure about my body, and that got highlighted as I got famous,\" says the singer, who last year revealed he'ddeveloped an eating disorderdue to body dysmorphia.\n\"But I realised, the biggest power you can give someone over you is in how you react. So I decided, I'm going to get sober, I'm going to get fit, and I discovered boxing.\"\nHe ended up working with the South African boxer Chris Heerden - who was recently in the news afterRussia jailed his ballerina girlfriend, Ksenia Karelina.\n\"I met him before all that,\" says Harrison, \"but he's been extremely inspirational. Boxing's become like therapy for me.\n\"If someone says something bad about me, I go to the gym, hit the punch bag for an hour and talk it out.\"\nFans have noticed the change… drooling over photos of his newly chiseled torso, and declaring 2025 his \"shirt-off era\".\n\"Maybe the shirt-off era is a comeback to all the comments I've had,\" he laughs.\n\"I'm claiming a freedom and a sexiness and a liberation.\"\nHe's clearly found a degree of serenity, without surrendering the restless energy that propelled him to fame.\nPart of that is down to control. In January,he created a new companythat brings together his core business of recorded music with touring operations, his fashion brand and his music festival, Bludfest.\nThe event kicked off in Milton Keynes last summer but suffered teething troubles, when fans were stuck in long queues.\n\"I will fully take responsibility for that,\" says the star, who claims he was \"backstage screaming\" at police and promoters to get the lines moving.\n\"The problem was, there were six gates open when there should have been 12,\" he says, suggesting people underestimated his fans' dedication.\n\"When Chase and Status had played [there] a day before, there were 5,000 people when the doors opened, and another 30,000 trickled in during the day.\n\"With my fans, there were 20,000 kids at the gate at 10am. So we've learned a lot for this year. There'll be pallets of water outside. It'll be very different.\"\nDedication to his fans is what makes Yungblud Yungblud.\nHe built the community directly from his phone and, whether intended or not, that connection has sustained his career - insulating him from the tyrannies of radio playlists and streaming placement.\nMaintaining a personal relationship becomes harder as his fanbase grows but, ever astute, he hired a fan to oversee his social accounts.\n\"She's called Jules Budd. She used to come to my gigs in Austin and she'd sell confetti to pay for gas money to the next city.\n\"She built an account called Yungblud Army, and she's amazing at letting me understand what are people feeling.\n\"If people are outside and security aren't treating them right, I know about it because she's in contact with them. So I brought her in to make the community safer as it gets bigger.\"\nWith his new album, he wants to make that community even bigger. Harking back to the sounds of Queen and David Bowie, he says it'll \"reclaim the good chords\" (Asus4 and Em7, in case you're wondering).\n\"The shackles are off,\" he grins.\n\"We made an album to showcase our ambition and the way we want to play.\n\"Can you imagine seeing Yungblud in a stadium? 100% yes. Let's do it.\""

    "content": "The team behind Netflix's new action thriller Havoc say it will \"put Wales on the map\" for filmmakers across the world.\nStarring Tom Hardy as a \"jaded\" detective, Havoc tells the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong.\nAlthough it is set in an unnamed US city, all of it - including car chases and shootouts - was filmed in Wales.\nHardy and his co-star Forest Whitaker werespotted filming in south Wales in 2021, but the production experienced several delays because of the pandemic andthe writers strike in the US.\nHavoc, which also stars Luis Guzmán, Jessie Mei Li and Timothy Olyphant, began with the vision of its Welsh director Gareth Evans.\n\"I had this, like, one core image which was a corrupt cop in a crime scene where a drug deal's gone wrong and for whatever reason he was scooping cocaine into a coffee cup,\" said Evans, best known for gangster film The Raid and thriller series Gangs of London.\n\"And it all mushroomed out from there.\"\nEvans said it was \"incredible\" when Hardy came on board in the lead role and as a producer.\n\"One of the nicest things about Tom [is] I knew I was in my wheelhouse when it came to action film-making, but with Tom his skillset is deep dive explorations into morally complex characters and so we were able to fuse two styles together.\"\nEvans, who grew up in Hirwaun, Rhondda Cynon Taf, still lives in Wales.\nHe said recreating the US in south Wales was \"challenging\" but he wanted to bring work to the area.\n\"I started going around, like, Swansea, Port Talbot, Cardiff and Newport, looking for any little bit of architecture that I could find that might pass as a little bit Americana,\" he said.\n\"And so we took a look and we thought if we can get 30% or 40% real in camera then the VFX (visual effects) can take care of the rest.\"\nSwansea's Brangwyn Hall became the outside of an American police precinct, Swansea University's Bay campus provided exterior street shots, and a fishing shack was built in the Merthyr Mawr countryside.\nAlthough Havoc was made in Wales, US production company XYZ Films joined forces with Wales-based Severn Screen to make it.\nAram Tertzakian, one of XYZ Films' founders, has worked with Evans since Apostle, the 2018 horror featuring Michael Sheen which was filmed around Margam Park in Port Talbot.\nTertzakian spent much of the pandemic in an Airbnb in Cardiff while Havoc was being filmed.\n\"Gareth brought me to Wales for this project because he is a great patriot and wanted to figure out how to make films in Wales,\" said Tertzakian.\nHe said he believed that after Havoc, filmmakers and producers in the industry are going to be \"a lot more focused on Wales being on the map\".\n\"I think it's always been seen as an option but when they see Havoc and what we pulled off, I think it's going to blow their minds and really make Wales a lot more viable for a lot of people.\n\"Wales is one of the good guys,\" he added.\n\"You've got really hard working crews, a lot of dedication and love for the game. You get some amazing locations, both interiors and exteriors and we had a blast.\"\nAccording to Netflix and Creative Wales, Havoc is the largest feature film ever to be shot entirely in Wales, with post production also completed in Cardiff.\nNetflix said its productions in Wales, which also include Sex Education, had generated more than £200m for the UK economy since 2020.\nJack Sargeant, Wales' minister for culture, said productions like Havoc had delivered \"significant economic and reputational benefits\".\n\"We are immensely proud of our Welsh creative industries, which employ over 35,000 talented individuals, and the world-class infrastructure we have in place for film and TV productions.\""

    "content": "BBC film critics Caryn James and Nicholas Barber pick their cinema highlights of the year so far, from a brutal war epic to an ambitious period vampire drama.\nThe sharpest American indie film of the year so far, Companion stars Jack Quaid and Sophie Thatcher as a devoted young couple who go to stay with some friends in a Russian tycoon's remote forest getaway. (Rupert Friend has a hilarious cameo as the mulleted oligarch.) As a drunken evening of confessions, suspicions and disagreements unfolds, it seems at first if the film might be a romantic comedy, or maybe a noirish thriller about a robbery gone wrong. In fact, Companion is a science-fiction comedy thriller – but beyond that, the less you know about the film in advance, the more enjoyable its many ingenious twists and turns will be. Suffice it to say that the big-screen debut of writer-director Drew Hancock is a sparklingly entertaining satire on modern technology and the never-more-relevant topic of how entitled and misogynistic certain insecure young men can be. And it packs all of its ideas into 97 minutes. (NB)\nAs stunning as Ryan Coogler'sBlack Pantherwas, he has outdone himself with Sinners. Michael B Jordan is slyly convincing as twins named Smoke and Stack, who return from Chicago to their home town in Mississippi, in the Jim Crow South in 1932, to open a juke joint. With huge ambition and imagination, Coogler swirls familiar genres and tropes into a wholly original film that blurs the real and the supernatural. Sinners is a period piece as well as a vampire film. It is a drama about racism, family, superstition and spirituality, and it comes with passionate sex and exhilarating blues music. Coogler directs with brio, at times creating a phantasmagoria in which robed African musicians appear next to rappers. The first hour is so full of texture it could stand alone as a period film, but the supernatural eventually intrudes, leading to a finale of action, blood and vengeance. Jordan is surrounded by a superb supporting cast, including Delroy Lindo, Wunmi Musaku and Hailee Steinfeld.  Sex, blues and vampires at the door? What more can anyone want from a film? (CJ)\nMiranda Yousef's riveting documentary tells the stranger-than-fiction story ofThomas Kinkade, one of the biggest-selling artists in history. Critics dismissed his work as nauseatingly sickly, but in the 1990s and 2000s, there were shops all around the US devoted to Kinkade's sentimental pictures of cosy country cottages. Art for Everybody asks fascinating questions about who gets to decide what counts as legitimate art, and whether some paintings can be more moral than others – questions that resonate today, in light of the continuing culture wars in the US . But Yousef's delicately balanced and sensitive film is just as fascinating on personal issues as it is on sociopolitical ones. A key part of Kinkade's marketing was his carefully constructed public image as a devoutly Christian, all-American family man, and yet the so-called \"Painter of Light\" had a dark side, too. Did the pressures of being a squeaky-clean Dr Jekyll push him into becoming a self-destructive Mr Hyde? (NB)\nAlex Garland, the writer and director ofCivil War, and Ray Mendoza, a veteran who was that film's military advisor, have created a harrowing, visceral, real-time drama that recreates an actual battle between Navy Seals and al-Qaeda jihadists. Garland's virtuoso technique and Mendoza's first-hand experience of war blend in a film of uncompromising focus, which plunges us into the intensity of combat without explanation or backstory. Yet the faces of Joseph Quinn, Will Poulter, Cosmo Jarvis and D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai are enough to capture the fear and determination of being under siege. Creating characters far from the bravado of typical Hollywood war films, the actors depict courage in battle as a terror-filled endurance test. The film immerses us in that feeling. It is loud and intense, relentless in its barrage of grenades and gunfire, and when the cries of pain from the injured men start, they never stop. Warfare is a dazzling technical achievement but much more. Focusing on the personal cost of combat and violence itself rather than the politics of the Iraq conflict, it reinvents the war film with bracing freshness and immediacy. (CJ)\nBarry Keoghan, Christopher Abbott and Colm Meaney star in this dark and bloody western-style thriller about a feud between sheep farmers in remote rural Ireland. Meaney and Abbott (who speak their dialogue in Irish) play a laconic father and son who lose their two prize rams, only to discover that they have been stolen by their neighbour's shiftless son (Keoghan). Accusations are made, simmering resentments reach boiling point, and violence ensues – but then Christopher Andrews, the film's debut writer-director, rewinds his story and replays it from a revelatory new perspective. Suddenly, a hard-boiled story of crime and retribution becomes an aching tragedy about desperate economic hardship, youthful stupidity, male pride, and the traumas passed down from taciturn fathers to taciturn sons. Bring Them Down is tough to watch but it's beautifully shot, cleverly plotted and stunningly powerful. (NB)\nAlain Guiraudie's (Stranger by the Lake) engaging film is full of surprises. It starts as a drama about Jeremie, a young man returning to his small village in the lush French countryside for a funeral, then becomes a quietly comic take on desire along with a thriller about covering up a murder. The film deftly carries the audience with it through all these turns. Jeremie is an opportunist but also an enigma. He may have had a passion for his former boss and mentor, the village baker, who died. The baker's widow definitely seems interested in Jeremie, who grew up as the best friend of her son, Vincent; he now angrily suspects Jeremie of wanting to sleep with his mother. Jeremie does not want that but he does find himself in a reluctant affair with the local priest. The joke is that so many people lust after the unremarkable Jeremie, and the suspense comes from the small-town eyes and local police wondering what happened when Vincent mysteriously disappears. Misericordia (Latin for mercy) was nominated for eight Cesar awards, the French equivalent of the Oscars, including film and director, but its human comedy lands easily with audiences everywhere. (CJ)\nDeep in the leafy French countryside, a scruffy teenage layabout Totone (Clément Faveau) has to look after his younger sister Claire (Luna Garret) after the sudden death of their father. His answer to their dire financial problems? Making award-winning luxury cheese. Louise Courvoisier's debut film is a heart-tugging coming-of-age drama, rooted in the soil of the Jura region where she grew up. She offers an earthy insider's view of how strenuous life can be for agricultural workers, and how wrenching it is when carefree youth turns to relentless, responsible adulthood. But she also fashions a warm, romantic, gorgeously scenic and ultimately hopeful tale of underdogs working together in the sunshine to improve their lives. Blessed are the cheesemakers, asMonty Pythononce put it. (NB)\nA giant, sloppy Great Dane tugs Naomi Watts around the streets of Manhattan, but by the end of this lovely film about affection and grief the physical comedy with the dog seems the least of it. Watts smoothly play Iris, a creative writing teacher whose best friend, Walter, a famous womanising author, kills himself. He leaves her his dog, Apollo, even though she lives in a one-room apartment in a pet-free building. Dealing with Apollo becomes a way for Iris to grapple with her feelings of love and loss for Walter, played by Bill Murray in flashback scenes filled with such wit and tenderness that they have a great impact in spite of his minimal screen time. Based on Sigrid Nunez's eloquent, acclaimed 2018 novel, the film was directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel, whose films include the underrated Montana Story (2021) with Haley Lu Richardson and Owen Teague. Avoiding mawkish clichés, they have created a gem of a film that is funny and touching whether you are a pet lover or not. Come for the rambunctious Great Dane, stay for the beautifully rendered emotions. (CJ)\nAardman's two greatest heroes are back – and so is their sneakiest ever adversary, a diabolical penguin named Feathers McGraw. Directed by Nick Park and Merlin Crossingham, the Oscar-nominated Vengeance Most Fowl is chock-full of the qualities that make Wallace & Gromit's farcical adventures so cherished: the painstaking stop-motion claymation, the Heath Robinson-style gadgetry, the winking homages to classic cinema, the gleefully silly British humour, and the deep affection for the characters and their world. Above all, it a treat to see Feathers McGraw, more than 30 years after he was introduced in The Wrong Trousers. But there is more to the Bristol-based studio's new film than the nostalgic whimsy you would expect. When Wallace invents a robotic garden gnome that does all of Gromit's favourite gardening jobs (and that's even before it turns evil), the story takes a canalboat trip intoMission: Impossibleterritory by addressing fears about artificial intelligence. (NB)\nThe immensely talented director Rungano Nyoni, whose I Am Not a Witch (2017) won a Bafta for outstanding British debut, makes artful, accessible films of great visual panache. Her latest is a clear-eyed drama about cultural and generational conflict. The heroine, Shula, is a cosmopolitan woman recently returned from the city to her village in Zambia. Nyoni conveys this dissonance at once, as Shula drives home from a costume party dressed in a glittery silver helmet and dark glasses (an homage to a Missy Elliott video) and finds her Uncle Fred dead on a dirt road. As the story takes us into the family's traditional funeral rituals, it slowly reveals that Shula and two cousins had been abused by Fred as children, a reality their mothers put aside as they mourn their brother. Nyoni's style is realistic even as she drops in surreal images. The narrative about secrecy and the trauma of sexual assault builds in power right to the end, when Shula recalls a children's television programme and the title of this stunning film finally makes sense.

    "content": "A magician who tricked her way into the Magic Circle is finally being granted membership - 34 years after she was kicked out.\nSophie Lloyd says she disguised herself as a man to fool examiners into letting her join the elite society in 1991, at a time female magicians were not allowed to be members.\nWhen the Circle announced it was permitting women to join later that year, Ms Lloyd revealed her deception, prompting the society to expel her at the very same meeting it admitted its first female magicians.\nFollowing a public search to find her, the Circle has now apologised to Ms Lloyd and is presenting her with a membership certificate on Thursday evening.\n\"I'm beyond thrilled,\" Ms Lloyd toldRadio 4's Today programmeon Thursday.\nIn the late 1980s, Ms Lloyd was studying at a school of mime in London where she befriended magician Jenny Winstanley.\n\"Jenny was increasingly frustrated that women, including herself, could not join the Magic Circle,\" Ms Lloyd said. \"So she came up with an idea to infiltrate the society by having me dress as a man. She couldn't do it herself as she was too recognisable.\"\nIt was a colossal undertaking. Ms Lloyd had worked as Miss Winstanley's assistant at gigs but hadn't performed magic on her own, so had to learn.\nShe invented a new identity - Raymond Lloyd - and spent about two years studying the character. She disguised herself with a wig, body suit and \"croaky\" voice. She wore gloves to hide her feminine hands.\nThere was nothing she could do about her height - 5ft 2in (1.57m) - so instead she styled Raymond as a \"young-looking, 18-year-old,\" with some facial \"fluff\", she told Canadian broadcasterCBCin 1991.\nMs Lloyd told the Today programme that her character was \"totally believed.\" She had no problems wearing the body suit, but the gloves made it \"very hard\" to do sleight of hand tricks, she said.\nBy March 1991, Ms Lloyd was ready to have her skills put to the test. Rather than being scrutinised at the Magic Circle's headquarters - which Ms Lloyd and Miss Winstanley deemed too risky - Ms Lloyd opted to invite the society's examiners to a 20-minute performance at a working men's club in front of 200 spectators. To cover up her voice, Ms Lloyd said Raymond had laryngitis.\nMs Lloyd even stayed for a drink with one of the examiners after the show.\nA week later, Ms Lloyd was told she had been granted membership to the Circle.\nFor months, Raymond Lloyd performed magic and even socialised with other Magic Circle members.\nWhen Ms Lloyd and Miss Winstanley later heard the society was going to begin accepting female magicians as members, they decided to come clean about their deception and Miss Winstanley told the society about it over the phone.\nBut the Magic Circle did not take kindly to the news. The duo got a letter saying that Raymond had been expelled, and in October 1991, at the first meeting accepting women into the society, Ms Lloyd was kicked out.\n\"We couldn't get our heads round it,\" Ms Lloyd said.\nMs Lloyd spent about 10 years performing across the country as a magician, including performing anti-bullying shows, before she moved to Spain, where she took early retirement and has been involved in animal rescue work. Miss Winstanley went on to run a pottery firm in Norfolk, before she died in a car crash in 2004.\nThe Magic Circle started a search for Ms Lloyd last year.\n\"I felt it important that the Magic Circle should be able to recognise Sophie as the role model for women magicians, as well as show that we are now a completely open society,\" said Laura London, the society's first female chair.\nMs Lloyd only found out about the search for her when her sister sent her a link to an interview. Initially reluctant to join the society because of the amount of time that had passed, she eventually decided to do it to honour Miss Winstanley's legacy.\nToday, the Magic Circle is still heavily male-dominated. The society has around 1,700 members, of which 5% are women.\nMs Lloyd will receive her new membership certificate at an event at the Circle's London headquarters on Thursday evening, which will feature performances by five magicians and be attended by both members of the society and the general public. The society says Miss Winstanley will also be recognised at the event.\n\"This is for Jenny, really,\" Ms Lloyd said. \"I just think Jenny would have loved it.\"\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.Sign up here."

    "content": "McFly star Tom Fletcher has said he felt \"overwhelming excitement\" working on the new Paddington stage musical, which producers have confirmed will open in November.\nThe singer-songwriter said he hoped the music and lyrics he has written for the show would \"do Paddington proud\", adding that the musical numbers are \"my favourite songs I've ever written\".\nThe show will open at the Savoy Theatre in the West End on 1 November, and follow Paddington as he arrives from Peru seeking a new home in London.\nThe musical, which has been in development for five years, is based on Michael Bond's original novels and follows the hugely successful recent film series.\nSpeaking about the show for the first time, Fletcher told BBC News he felt \"so honoured and lucky\" to be working on the project, which he said would reflect \"all of the fun, warmth and heart that the books and movies have captured so brilliantly\".\n\"There is something so magical about seeing Paddington step out on to the stage, and seeing him... I was about to say in the flesh, but I guess in the fur is more accurate,\" he joked.\nFletcher is best-known as the founding member of pop band McFly, whose hits include All About You, Obviously and Star Girl, and is also a successful children's author.\nHe was first approached about Paddington around the time of the first Covid lockdown in early 2020, and workshopped the project with scriptwriter Jessica Swale, director Luke Sheppard and the producers before the showwas formally announced in 2023.\nWith the musical now almost ready to launch, Swale told BBC News it would feature \"lots of juicy new material\".\n\"We're bringing a lot of new flavours to the table, but of course we're all in love with the original material, so we've been faithful to our cast of characters,\" she said.\n\"Of course the Browns are part of it, and familiar faces like Mr Gruber and Mr Curry, but there are a lot of new people as well. We've been very inspired by the books and the films but we like to think we're covering new territory.\"\nBond's first book in the series, A Bear Called Paddington, was published in 1958.\nThe author went on to write 29 Paddington books in total, the final one being Paddington at St Paul's, which was published posthumously in 2018. The stories have sold more than 35 million copies worldwide.\nFletcher said he relished the opportunity to find what \"the musical language\" of Paddington was. \"Having something that everybody knows but no-one's heard what it sounds like yet is a really exciting thing to be able to work on,\" he explained.\nHe recalled that, when producer Eliza Lumley first called him about the project, he not only immediately replied with \"a very fast 'yes please'\", but began writing music for the show right away.\n\"While I was still on the phone to her, I had the idea for a song, so I went and wrote my first song for it that night, instantly after getting off the phone, and that song is still in the musical now.\"\nHe reflected: \"My instant reaction wasn't to be intimidated, it was to be excited and just so inspired by these stories and films that I already knew, I just jumped straight at my piano and started writing.\"\nThe three film adaptations of Paddington, featuring the voice of Ben Whishaw, have been a huge success at the box office since the first was released in 2014.\nIn recent years, London has seen pop group Abba represented by virtual avatars on stage, while some animated film characters have been depicted using more traditional puppeteering methods, such as snowman Olaf in the stage adaptation of Frozen.\nIt has not yet been revealed what approach producers will take to representing Paddington in the theatre.\n\"I don't know what you're talking about, he's a bear!\" joked Swale. \"He's travelling from Peru to be a special part of our show!\"\nShe continued: \"I can't give away our secrets. One of the things I'm most excited about for this show is the character of Paddington.\"\nSwale credits producers Lumley and Sonia Friedman for \"really experimenting with every possible way that we could tell the bear's story in the best way, and the magic that they've found in how they do it”, adding: “Every single time I see Paddington for the first time, it makes me cry.\n\"I think he's completely magic, and to me he's very real. But I don't think audiences will be disappointed. It's a wonderful, theatrical version of how to tell this story.\"\nAs for the character himself, Swale noted the musical \"also reveals the spirit and the politics of Paddington\".\n\"For example, Paddington is a refugee, so we want to honour the fact that he is somebody who migrates to the UK and doesn't have a home, and make sure we are conscious of the experience of who he represents.\"\nBetween now and the show's opening in November, Fletcher said the team would be \"fine-tuning for as long as we can, and making sure that we get it absolutely right\".\nHe added: \"I really hope that I've done everyone who loves Paddington justice... This is so different to anything I've ever done before. I feel like this show is so ready to be out in the world, it's the most special thing I've ever been a part of in my whole life.\"\nThe 39-year-old will be on tour with McFly and Busted when the musical opens in November, \"so I'll be going from touring with the band and then rushing back to London to fit it all in\", he explained.\n\"It's a slightly hectic schedule, but we'll make it work somehow. I might get confused and start singing Paddington songs on stage with McFly.\"\nMost important, of course, is the question of whether or not Paddington's favourite food will feature in the stage adaptation.\n\"You can rest easy,\" laughed Swale. \"Marmalade features not only in the book and the lyrics, but physically on stage in a spectacular way.\""

    "content": "Organisers of the BBC Proms are encouraging fans to stay up all night, with a \"magical\" and \"intimate\" after-hours concert at the Royal Albert Hall.\nPlans for the Dark Till Dawn Prom were unveiled in the programme announcing the summer festival, which will also feature one-handed pianist Nicholas McCarthy, rock star St Vincent and a celebration of film composer Bernard Herrmann.\nThe ever-popular CBeebies Prom will return, and Claudia Winkleman will host a concert exploring the tense and haunting soundtrack to the hit TV show The Traitors.\nHighlights of the classical repertoire include Shoshtakovich's opera Lady Macbeth, and Korean sensation Yunchan Lim playing Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto No 4.\nOn 5 September, Sir Simon Rattle will conduct Chineke! - Europe's first minority Black and ethnically diverse orchestra - for the first time.\nTheir concert will include a performance of the final work by Pulitzer-winning US composer George Walker, which was written as a response to the2015 Charleston church shooting.\nOther stars gracing the 2025 season include soprano of the moment Aigul Akhmetshina, making her Proms debut, violinist Randall Goosby, sitar virtuoso Anoushka Shankar, Pakistani-American singer Arroj Aftab, and Grammy award-winner Angelique Kidjo.\nThere will be 86 concerts in all, with a number taking place in Gateshead, Bristol, Bradford, Belfast and Sunderland.\nTickets go on sale at 9am on 17 May. On-the-day \"Promming\" tickets are £8 including booking fees, and seated tickets start from £10 plus booking fees.\nThe all-nighter, on 8 August, is being planned by organist Anna Lapwood, who said the idea had been several years in the making.\n\"I spend a lot of time at the Albert Hall in the middle of the night, practising, and I find it fascinating that the building is still just running overnight,\" she says.\n\"There are always people there - cleaners and security guards - a bit like A Night At The Museum.\n\"So we talked about how fun it would be to be able to invite people into that space, both physically, but also the abstract space of being in an iconic building in the middle of the night.\"\nHer programme will include YouTube pianist Hayato Sumino, Russian cellist Anastasia Kobekina and Norwegian ensemble Barroksolistene, whose \"Alehouse sessions\" aim to recreate the atmosphere of a 17th Century English tavern.\nLapwood says the artists are all connected by an enthusiasm for \"messing around\" with music, citing Sumino's viral video of the \"seven degrees of Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star\".\n\"There are various moments where we're hoping to do some collaborations,\" she reveals. \"But the logistics of this are all very, very complicated, not least trying to figure out everyone's sleep schedules!\"\nThis summer's season is the first since the departure of Proms director David Pickard. He has been replaced by Hannah Donat who, as director of artistic planning, had shaped the festival alongside the controller of BBC Radio 3, Sam Jackson.\n\"I think of the Proms as the classical music equivalent of Wimbledon,\" she says.\n\"Everyone likes to go to Wimbledon, even if they don't watch tennis for the rest of the year; and everyone likes to go to a Prom, even if they're not going to concerts for the rest of the season.\"\n\"It gives the concerts a warmth and an informal atmosphere.\n\"People don't worry too much about knowing the repertoire inside out - there's just something spectacular about the Albert Hall and seeing the orchestra onstage.\"\nAmong the concerts to watch out for are:\n19 July: The Great American Songbook and Beyond with Samara Joy. Fresh from winning best jazz album at this year's Grammys, US singer Samara Joy teams up with the BBC Concert Orchestra for a night of standards by Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Billie Holliday.\n20 July: Ravel's Piano Concerto for the Left Hand. The world's only professional one-handed concert pianist, Nicholas McCarthy, makes his Proms debut, playing a concerto originally written for Paul Wittgenstein, after he lost his right arm during World War One.\n26 July: The Traitors.\"I've asked for a cloak and an owl,\" says Claudia Winkelman, ahead of this one-off concert, featuring classical pieces \"with betrayal at their heart\" alongside the gothic re-workings of pop songs heard in the TV reality show.\n2 August: Mahler's Resurrection Symphony. Canadian mezzo-soprano Emily D'Angelo, whose voice has been called \"a thing of wonder\", makes her Proms debut with Norwegian soprano Mari Eriksmoen and the Hallé orchestra.\n8 August: 100 Years of the Shipping Forecast. The subtle magic of the Shipping Forecast is celebrated in a special concert, in Belfast's Ulster Hall, featuring Radio 4's continuity announcers and a new work by poet laureate Simon Armitage.\n9 August: The Planets and Star Wars.The National Youth Orchestra play two of the world's most recognisable pieces of orchestral music, with an intergalactic theme.\n10 August: Edward Gardner Conducts the LPO.Taking a journey through icy waters and cascading waterfalls, the London Philharmonic present a quartet of pieces, including Debussy's La Mer and Sibelius's Oceanides - with an aquatic theme. Electrifying mezzo-soprano Aigul Akhmetshina joins in, for her Proms debut.\n14 August: Joe Hisaishi and Steve Reich.Legendary Studio Ghibli composer Joe Hisaishi makes his Proms debut conducting the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in two large-scale works exploring themes of destruction and loss - including his piece The End of the World, reflecting the \"anxiety and chaos\" after the 2001 terrorist attacks in New York.\n23 August: Mäkelä conducts Mahler's Fifth. Finnish conductor Klaus Mäkelä isn't yet 30, but his electrifying performances have already made headlines around the world. He comes to the Proms with the Dutch Concertgebouw Orchestra, to play Mahler's leonine fifth symphony.\n7 September: Angelique Kidjo - African Symphony. \"I want to show the world the richness and beauty of African culture,\" says the Beninese-French music icon Angelique Kidjo of her return to the Proms. Part of Bradford's City of Culture programme, her concert will highlight iconic tracks from legends including Miriam Makeba, Fela Kuti and Youssou N'Dour.\nThe season concludes with the traditional \"Last Night\" on 13 September, conducted by Elim Chan.\nSoprano Louise Alder and trumpeter Alison Balsom will make star turns, alongside the traditional medley of sea shanties, Pomp and Circumstance and Auld Lang Syne.\nThe concert will also include Donat's favourite \"Easter egg\" for her first year in charge.\n\"There's a piece of music that I'd wanted to get into the Proms for some time,\" she says, referring to Arthur Benjamin's Storm Cloud Contata.\nThe music was originally written for Alfred Hitchcock's spy thriller The Man Who Knew Too Much in 1934; and re-arranged by Bernard Herrmann for Hitchcock's Hollywood remake in 1956.\n\"The final scene takes place in the Albert Hall,\" explains Donat, \"and while Jimmy Stewart's chasing this assassin around the building, Bernard Herrmann is conducting the orchestra on stage - and that's the piece we're including in the Last Night of the Proms.\n\"It's one of those little winks to the audience that I like to include during the season.\"\nFor those who cannot attend, all of the concerts will be broadcast on BBC Radio 3 and BBC Sounds, and 25 of the nights will be televised."

    "content": "From the latest season of the dystopian workplace drama to the UK miniseries that got the world talking and a new hit medical show, we pick the year's greatest programmes to stream right now.\nHollywood is an easy target, butthis satireis so sharp, astute and sometimes absurd that it may be the funniest show of the year. Seth Rogen, who co-created the show, plays Matt Remick, the newly appointed head of Continental Studios, a lover of high-art films with a mandate to make commercial hits based on IP including Kool-Aid. A flood of actors and directors – including Ron Howard, Olivia Wilde and Zoe Kravitz – make cameo appearances, gleefully spoofing their own images, none funnier than Martin Scorsese in the hilarious opening episode. The series regulars are ideally cast, with Ike Barniholtz as Sal Saperstein, Matt's second-in-command, Catherine O'Hara as the previous studio head and Kathryn Hahn as the loud, wackily-dressed head of publicity. Taking us into the Golden Globes and marketing meetings, The Studio suggests that everyone is just bumbling along at a moment when the entire movie industry is in crisis. The industry might not know where it's going, but this behind-the-scenes comedy is a pure delight. (CJ)\nAvailable on Apple TV+ internationally\nOne thing's for sure: if Mike White's first-world-problems satire about rich holidaymakers was admired by many for its first two seasons, it broke out to become a true cultural phenomenon in its third, witha huge ratings boost. This time round, it sent its dysfunctional groupings – a corrupt financier and his family, three clashing female friends, a vengeful man and his younger girlfriend – to a Thai wellness retreat, and every week, you could not move online (metaphorically) for thediscourse it generatedand debate it stirred. Some complained that this season was too slow and lacked suitable plot momentum, while others pointed out, sagely, that the problem was that it was a character-led drama that was never meant to be dissected like Game of Thrones, but for its unexpected blockbuster popularity. Personally? I enjoyed it as both the darkest and most reflective series so far, but one which again thrived off a magisterially cast ensemble, in which Parker Posey, Carrie Coon, Aimee Lou Wood and Patrick Schwarzenegger were standouts, but no one was a weak link. (HM)\nAvailable on Max in the US and Now in the UK\nIt's no wonder that this uncompromising British series about a 13-year-old boy accused of murdering a girl in his school has become a cultural flashpoint, praised by UK Prime MinisterSir Keir Starmer, made available to be shown inschoolsand sparking conversations about young men and the toxic influence of social media. The social issue is wrapped in a drama brilliantly personalized and brought to life by the actors. Stephen Graham, who created the show with Jack Thorne, plays the boy's father and conveys the shock and grief of a parent forced to consider the unthinkable possibility that his son might be a killer. Owen Cooper gives a remarkably sophisticated performance as the accused boy, who seems guileless until he explodes in anger. And Ashley Waters plays a detective who struggles to understand his own teenage son, expanding the theme beyond one family. Each episode was shot in a single, real-time take, which sounds like a gimmick, but director Philip Barantini handles that approach so smoothly that it fades into the background, even while adding intensity to a piercing drama that offers no comfortable resolution. (CJ)\nAvailable on Netflix internationally\nFairly or not, Apple TV+ has become a streamer known for ploughing huge resources (over $20bn, reportedly) into a range of starry shows that not very many people watch – but with the second series of this dystopian workplace drama, it became clear it had a genuine watercooler hit on its hands. Which is even more surprising, when you consider just how strange Severance is. Its compelling high-concept premise – in which employees of the sinister Lumon corporation have their consciousness separated into office selves, or \"innies\", and home selves, or \"outies\" – is one thing, but beyond that, it is constantly taking the story down surreal rabbit holes, involving for example, mysterious \"macrodata refinement\" work or a herd of goats. In truth, as this series progressed through its second half, it felt a little too meandering for its own good, and its climactic payoff couldn't match that from the first season. But it's still an exquisite work in all areas, from the clever dual-identity acting (especially from shining star Britt Lower) to the stark visuals. Bring on season three, and perhaps a few more solid answers as to what'sreallygoing on at Lumon. (HM)\nAvailable on Apple TV+ internationally\nIt might sound like just another medical drama, but this show about a trauma centre in Pittsburgh revitalises the genre with its attention to the psychological stress on caregivers. Noah Wyle gives a shattering performance as the department head, the dedicated, harried, emotionally wracked Dr Robbie, still traumatised after failing to save his mentor during the Covid-19 pandemic. He is surrounded by other doctors and a group of students and interns, each adding a different dimension, from Supriya Ganesh as a brilliant medical prodigy to Isa Briones as an abrasive intern and Taylor Dearden as the caring Dr Mel, whose neurodivergence makes her especially empathetic with her patients. Unlike most medical shows, The Pitt never lets their personal melodrama overwhelm the focus on their work. Each absorbing, fast-paced episode takes place in real time during one 15-hour-long shift, and each veers between the devastation of losing patients and the relief of saving them. You'd think a series so blunt about death would be depressing, but instead The Pitt is exhilarating in its focus on people for whom life and death are everyday events. (CJ)\nAvailable on Max in the US\nIt's difficult to discuss the power of this show without giving away the key twist that comes at the end of episode one. But safe to say, it turns what starts as a relatively conventional political thriller on its head. Sterling K Brown is the head of the US president's security detail, who finds himself accused of murder of his boss – but above and beyond the killing itself, not everything seems quite right with the world. Created by Dan Fogelman, the man behind the equally rug-pulling TV weepieThis is Us, this is solid entertainment in the very best sense, with sharp plotting matched by some strong performances, from Brown’s tortured hero to Julianne Nicholson as a sinister tech billionaire. Plus, later on in the series, one particular episode which deals with truly monumental matters is simply breathtaking – but again, that's all that can be said without spoiling things for those yet to watch. The good news for those that have is that it's already been recommissioned. (HM)\nAvailable on Hulu in the US and Disney+ internationally\nThe sumptuous conclusion to this adaptation of Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall trilogy blends a beautifully shot escape into the luxurious past of Henry VIII's court with an evergreen depiction of the high personal cost of manoeuvring for power and influence. Mark Rylance is poignant as the king's advisor,Thomas Cromwell, who questions his own decisions, while the mercurial Henry is losing confidence in him. And Damian Lewis's fresh interpretation of Henry is dazzling, his voice and manner chillingly subdued even as he issues the most ruthless commands. Henry's wives come and go, but the unravelling bond between these men, and their opposite trajectories – Cromwell's self-doubts and decline and Henry's iron will that eliminates anyone in his way – shape the story. Written by Peter Straughn, a recent Oscar winner for his screenplay ofConclave, The Mirror and the Light is more resonant today than the original Mantel book was when it was published in 2020. It feels entirely relevant in a world where creeping authoritarianism is a global concern. (CJ)\nAvailable on PBS in the US and BBC iPlayer in the UK\nSince breaking out in HBO teen drama Euphoria, rising star Jacob Elordi has chosen his roles well – but perhaps nothing has served him better so far than returning to his home country of Australia to play the protagonist in this searing war drama. An adaptation of Richard Flanagan's Booker Prize-winning novel, it explores the life of World War Two army surgeon Dorrigo Evans across three time periods: his stint stationed in Adelaide for military training, his hellish experiences as a prisoner of war in the Thai jungle, and then his existence as a professionally successful but emotionally deeply troubled veteran (now played by Ciarán Hinds), still unable to truly process the events of decades ago. Brought to impactful visual life by Justin Kurzel, known for his visceral studies of male violence on the big screen like Snowtown andThe Order, it is simply one of the best evocations of the horrors of conflict that has been committed to screen. But at the same time, it takes as much care in its exploration of passion as violence, with the chemistry between Elordi's young Dorrigo and his uncle's wife Amy (a superb Odessa Young) burning up the screen. Given some of the scenes of sadistic brutality, it is of course a difficult watch, as it should be, but also one whose sheer artistry offers a kind of transcendence. (HM)\nAvailable on Prime Video in the US, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada\nJon Hamm has never been better, expertly mixing comedy and drama in this series about a hedge-fund manager called Coop, who loses his job. He schemes to keep up appearances in his wealthy community, only to discover a new sense of himself. The show has a broad comic element, as Coop turns cat burglar, solving his financial problems by stealing luxury items from his neighbours. But the series is best in its bold take on what he calls in one of his mordant voiceovers, \"the quiet desperation of rich middle-aged men\", and in its depiction of his complicated relationships. He is still emotionally attached to his ex-wife (Amanda Peet), who left him for one of his friends, and struggles to connect with his two teenage children. He has a tender, supportive bond with his emotionally fragile sister (Lena Hall, a standout in the cast). Hamm hasn't had a role this rich since Don Draper inMad Men, another flawed but sympathetic charmer who makes some wildly bad decisions, and defines the character so perfectly that it's hard to imagine anyone else at the centre of this sleek but penetrating series. (CJ)\nAvailable on AppleTV+ internationally\nIt might have created a little less noise than Adolescence, but here is another British show about masculinity that really deserves to be seen. Jack Rooke's semi-autobiographical show about two university students who form an odd-couple friendship – nerdy gay man Jack and straight jack-the-lad Dan – has been an incredibly deft mix of laugh-out-loud humour, complete with delightfully niche pop culture references, and poignant drama – covering sexual awakening, depression, dementia and more besides – since it started in 2022. But this third and final series was undoubtedly its most powerful, kicking off with a hilarious episode on a package holiday in Greece but getting more serious as it continued, and handling Danny's spiralling mental health problems with particular skill. And boy, does Rooke know how to shatter audience hearts – the final episode is an emotional masterclass, including a significant cameo from the man himself. Here's hoping that it launches its extremely talented creator into the big time.

    "content": "From Drop to A Minecraft Movie, these are the films to stream at home and watch at the cinema this month.\nDavid Cronenberg's latest sci-fi-tinged drama stars Vincent Cassel as Karsh, an inventor who looks a lot like Cronenberg himself. Grief-stricken by the death of his wife (Diane Kruger), Karsh develops camera systems that can be buried with corpses, so that their relatives can watch them on monitors as they decompose. The invention catches on, but one night some graves containing these high-tech \"shrouds\" are desecrated, so Karsh and his brother-in-law (Guy Pearce) have to work out who was responsible. This may sound like the kind of scenario that the director of Scanners and The Fly might use to justify lots of gory body horror, but The Shrouds is a \"restrained, even elegant\" film inspired by Cronenberg's own bereavement,says Steve Pond at The Wrap. \"It's a deeply personal look at loss that finds plenty of time to get creepy but never loses sight of the fact that it's a movie about grief… Its focus, which never wavers, is always on the feeling of loss, not the sight of gore.\"\nReleased on 18 April in the US\nThree of Hollywood's brightest young stars get together in On Swift Horses, a handsome period romance directed by Daniel Minhan and adapted from Shannon Pufahl's novel.

He is looking forward to a traditional family life in California in the go-getting 1950s, but when his younger brother Julius (Jacob Elordi) comes to stay, Julius's gay relationships and gambling sprees help Muriel to understand why she is attracted to women and drawn to betting on horse races.Graham Guttman at Screen Rant calls the filma \"quietly devastating [story of] great pain and even greater love, all of which is portrayed beautifully by the film's all-star cast\", adding: \"On Swift Horses, with its sweeping romance and epic nature, feels outside of time, transcending any issues to become something deeply affecting.\" On the other hand,the BBC's Caryn James considers it\"a disappointment [that] works much better as an idea than as a film\".\nReleased on 25 April in the US and Canada, and on 30 April in France\nOn a remote island in Eastern Europe, fanged and furry monsters called Ochi lurk in the forests. A farmer (Willem Dafoe) is obsessed by hunting them, but when his shy teenage daughter (Helena Zengel) finds an injured baby Ochi, it turns out to be a big-eyed, pointy-eared beastie that bears a striking resemblance to Gizmo from Gremlins and Grogu from The Mandalorian. The girl then defies her father and takes the creature back to its family – a journey that is visualised using practical rather than digital effects. \"The Legend of Ochi, the rare A24 family film, is a charming throwback to adventure movies of the 80s like The Neverending Story and The Dark Crystal,\"says Brian Tallerico at RogerEbert.com, \"complete with original puppetry that reportedly contains not an ounce of CGI manipulation. It feels like a family film made by flesh-and-blood people in an era when computers are doing so much of the work.\"\nReleased on 25 April in the US, the UK, Canada and Ireland\nRyan Coogler has already put his own personal stamp on the sports drama (Creed) and the superhero blockbuster (Black Panther), and now, with Sinners, the writer-director takes on gothic horror. His favourite leading man, Michael B Jordan, plays two gun-toting twin brothers, Smoke and Stack, who go back to their rural hometown in 1930s Louisiana, only to find that the local blues music \"can pierce the veil between life and death\". The town is soon infested with vampires – but don't think of Sinners as a straightforward vampire chiller. \"The film is very genre-fluid,\"Coogler said in The Hollywood Reporter. \"It switches in and out of a lot of different genres. Yes, vampires are an element, but it's not the only supernatural element in the movie... I'm blessed to have found this medium that I can work out deep philosophical and existential questions that I may be struggling with while contributing to an art form that means so much to my family.\"\nReleased internationally on 18 April\nFirst dates can be awkward, but not many are as awkward as the one in Drop, a high-concept one-location thriller from Christopher Landon, the writer-director of Happy Death Day and Freaky. Meghann Fahy stars as a single mother, Violet, who agrees to have dinner with the eligible Henry (Brandon Sklenar) in a Chicago skyscraper's restaurant. Everything is going smoothly until someone in the restaurant starts sending threatening messages to Violet's phone. She is told that there is an intruder in her home, and that unless she poisons Henry, her five-year-old son will be killed. \"[Fahy's] dialled-in performance is thankfully matched by an overarching crispness to the proceedings,\"says Adrian Horton in The Guardian. \"Just enough flourishes, an enjoyable but not unbearable amount of stress, no wasted time, a perfect match of star, script and style. For those who sort for lean and limber in their thrillers, Drop is a date worth making.\"\nReleased internationally on 11 April\nWhen Alex Garland was making his last film,Civil War, his military advisor for the battle sequences was Ray Mendoza, an Iraq War veteran. This collaboration prompted Garland and Mendoza to co-direct another film, a faithful recreation of a battle which Mendoza himself was in, that plays out in real time over 90 minutes. D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai plays Mendoza (alongside Will Poulter, Joseph Quinn and Charles Melton) in what some critics are calling cinema's most authentic and immersive ever depiction of a wartime firefight. It's a film that pushes the \"war is hell\" concept \"to its logical, visceral and most infernal conclusion\",says Kevin Maher in The Times. \"This is a movie that's as difficult to watch as it is to forget. It's a sensory blitz, a percussive nightmare and a relentless assault on the soul.\"\nReleased on 11 April in the US and Canada, 16 April in Spain, 17 April in Australia, Brazil and Germany, and 18 April in the UK\nIf you finished watching Peter Jackson's series, The Beatles: Get Back, and you wanted to know what John Lennon got up to after the Fab Four broke up, then One to One: John & Yoko could be the film for you. Directed by Kevin Macdonald (One Day in September, Marley) along with Sam Rice-Edwards, the documentary chronicles the 18 months in the early 1970s when Lennon and Yoko One lived in Greenwich Village, New York. It covers the only full-length concert Lennon played after his time in The Beatles – but that was just one of the couple's many endeavours during their stay in the Big Apple. \"Drawing on televised interviews, taped phone calls with agents and managers, and personal film footage,\"says David Hughes in Time Out, \"Macdonald charts the couple's determination to fight for any worthy cause that crosses their eyeline, from the Vietnam War to fundraising for remanded prisoners unable to afford bail. The pair's artistry, individually and collectively, seems to be matched only by their energy and moral clarity.\"\nReleased on 11 April in the US, the UK and Ireland\nWhat if Die Hard was set at a meeting of the world's most powerful political leaders? And what if the US president in Air Force One was a woman? The answer to both of these questions can be found in G20, a gleefully over-the-top action thriller directed by Patricia Riggen. Viola Davis stars as US President Danielle Sutton, who is at a G20 summit in South Africa when a terrorist group takes the guests hostage. What the bad guys (led by Antony Starr from The Boys) haven't counted on is that the POTUS is an army veteran, and even when she's wearing a cocktail dress, she can fight with the best of them. \"It was the sort of thing you'd imagine as a kid, just playing the most heroic character you could possibly play,\"Davis told Variety. The only question the film doesn't answer is whether the sequel will be called G21.\nReleased on 10 April on Prime\nA Minecraft Movie is a children's adventure co-starring Jack Black, and adapted from a video game about a colourful fantasy world being threatened by infernal invaders. Does that sound familiar? If so, it's because the very same summary applies to The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Still, that was the second highest grossing film of 2023, so maybe A Minecraft Movie will be just as lucrative. The difference is that the new film, which also stars Jason Momoa and Jennifer Coolidge, has live-action actors in a CGI world. Also, it's directed by Jared Hess, the maker of such eccentric comedies as Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre. \"By some force of alchemy, his cockeyed look at things – a mix of deadpan delivery, garish colours, and exaggerated interactions – is weirdly perfect for this adaptation,\"says Jordan Hoffman in Entertainment Weekly. \"There's an 'anything goes' attitude here… [and] this loosey-goosey attitude is a breath of fresh air after so many family films that seem preordained by lore.\"\nReleased internationally on 4 April\nWith a dynamic that's not a million miles away from the central relationship in A Real Pain, Sacramento is an indie comedy about two mismatched male friends – one neurotic, the other annoyingly outgoing – embarking on a trip together. Glenn, played by Michael Cera, is even more anxious than usual because he is about to become a father, while the extrovert Rickey, played by Michael Angarano, is traumatised by the death of his own father. Could a weekend in Sacramento, California help them to overcome all of their issues? Angarano is also the co-writer, co-producer and director of a film that features both his ex-partner, Kristen Stewart, and his current partner, Maya Erskine.David Ehrlich at IndieWire says that Angarano\"graduates from overeager dilettante to unusually shrewd comic director\" with Sacramento. \"Its casual nature and outward lack of ambition belie how well it manages to convey the terror that change brings into our lives, the mania of trying to deny it, and the relief that comes from recognising that someone else in your world is changing with you.\"\nReleased on 11 April in the US\nAng Lee's second film, The Wedding Banquet, was a romantic comedy about a gay Taiwanese New Yorker who marries a Chinese woman so that she can get a green card, only for his unwitting parents to mark the occasion with a lavish party. The film made Lee's name as a director when it was released in 1993, and it went on to be nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe. Now it has been remade by Andrew Ahn (Fire Island), with a stellar cast that includes Bowen Yang (Wicked), Lily Gladstone (Killers of the Flower Moon) and Kelly Marie Tran (Star Wars: The Last Jedi). Ahn moves the story to Seattle, adds a subplot about fertility treatment, and rejigs the nationalities and generations so that the visiting relative is now a grandmother (Minari's Youn Yuh-jung) from South Korea. \"An intended marriage of convenience still lies at its heart,\"says Amber Wilkinson in Screen Daily, \"but the relationships are given a modern makeover as Ahn probes questions of commitment and celebrates the families we choose to make for ourselves\".\nReleased on 18 April in the US and Canada\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "Esoteric and pioneering, the paintings of a lesser-known Pre-Raphaelite, Evelyn De Morgan, explored the trauma and meaning of war – and prefigured current fantasy art.\nOn a rocky beach that glows red with lava, smoke-breathing dragons surround wretched-looking prisoners beseeching an angel to deliver them from suffering. The oil painting Death of the Dragon by Evelyn De Morgan looks at first like a scene from the New Testament's apocalyptic Book of Revelation. But, painted between 1914 and 1918, it's also something more personal and critical: an allegory for the misery and bondage of World War One, and the confrontation between good and evil.\nThe spectacular painting, measuring more than a metre high, is one of the highlights of a new exhibition,Evelyn De Morgan: The Modern Painter in Victorian London, at London's Guildhall Art Gallery, home to the City of London Corporation's art collection. On display are rarely seen works from theDe Morgan Foundation, as well as twonewly-restored paintingsand two recreations, completed just last year, of works lost in an art warehouse fire in 1991.\nThe show coincides with the reopening of the De Morgan Museum in Barnsley, Yorkshire, following an extensive roof renovation, and responds to arising interestin this lesser-known artist. She has tended to be eclipsed by her husband William – a ceramicist and writer, who had worked early in his career with the textile designerWilliam Morris– and the famous men in their circle: her uncle and art teacher, John Roddam Spencer Stanhope, for example, and the painters William Holman Hunt andDante Gabriel Rossetti. Much of what we know about De Morgan today comes from her sister Wilhelmina, who set up the De Morgan Foundation, but even she saw fit to publish the couple's posthumous biography under the title William De Morgan and his Wife.\nYet, Evelyn De Morgan more than deserves the art world's belated acclaim. A Slade graduate, who was working at the tail end of the Pre-Raphaelite movement, she took the arguably twee or overly sentimental genre into new territory, creating tableaux that were unusually visionary and energetic. The women she portrayed were less passive than thosedepicted by her contemporaries, and featured as symbols of agency rather than objects of the male gaze. Instead of a drowned body floating down the river, as in Sir John Everett Millais'Ophelia, or figures whose main currency wastheir looks, we meet a skilledsorceress creating magical potionsandflying superheroineswho can cast rain, thunder and lightning from their fingers.\nThese goddess-like figures show the influence of the classical art that De Morgan had studied. Immaculately executed works such asBoreas and Oreithyia(1896) reveal her interest in mythology and her mastery of the human form, reminiscent of Michelangelo.\nIn Death of the Dragon, in terms of composition, it's easy to see the influence of Sandro Botticelli'sThe Birth of Venus(1483–1485), which De Morgan had visited in Florence. If De Morgan's haloed angel echoes this idea of rebirth − reflecting the artist's belief in a spiritual afterlife − then the winged beasts are its counterpart, Death, always biting at the heels of the people and threatening to overcome them. Elsewhere in her work, Death takes alternative forms: adark angel bearing a scythe,sea monstersor – more obliquely –a sand timer. It's a symbolism that speaks to life's transience, and acquires additional poignancy in her later work, conveying the collective trauma of living through a World War that claimed close to a million British lives.\n\"During the First World War they [the De Morgans] were in London, so they would have been directly affected,\" Jean McMeakin, Chair of the Board of Trustees of the De Morgan Foundation, tells the BBC. \"Death was real for them in a way that perhaps we've largely forgotten these days,\" she points out. \"Members of William's family died from tuberculosis, and his own health was often quite poor. Death was, in a way, always present in the background.\"\nMore like this:\n•Why this iconic 1839 painting is not what it seems\n•The surprising story of Van Gogh's guardian angel\n•Nine striking, rare photos of 19th-Century America\nDe Morgan was a pacifist and her art became a form of activism. InOur Lady of Peace(1907), a response to the Boer Wars, a knight pleads for protection and peace, while inThe Poor Man who Saved the City(1901), wisdom and diplomacy are advocated as alternatives to military intervention. Later, inThe Red Cross(1914-16), angels carry the crucified Christ over a withered landscape pierced by Belgian war graves – a suggestion, perhaps, that the Christian faith is at odds with the brutality of war, but offers us hope of redemption. \"You must never praise war,\" De Morgan declared in The Result of an Experiment (1909), a book of\"automatic writing\"co-authored with her husband. \"The Devil invented it, and you can have no conception of its horrors.\"\nThe idea of the forces of good and evil acting upon ordinary people was pervasive at this time. \"Spiritualism was quite popular,\" asserts McMeakin, citing the author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle – the creator of Sherlock Holmes – as one of its most famous adherents. Other-worldly beliefs, she says, were \"probably the result of the turmoil, the massive changes happening in society leading up to the turn of the century, plus a period of many wars, which would have had an impact on their view of the world\". Doubtless, De Morgan was also influenced by her mother-in-law, Sophia, a well-known spiritualist and medium. With so many lives lost, it was no doubt tempting to believe that you could reconnect with the departed.\nFor De Morgan, materialism was in opposition to spirituality, and many of her works conflate the pursuit of wealth with death. Crowns, as worn by the winged serpents in Death of the Dragon, are a repeated motif denoting greed and miserliness. InEarthbound(1897), an avaricious king in a gold cloak patterned with coins is about to be overwhelmed by the angel of death, while inThe Barred Gate(c.1910-1914), a similar figure is denied entry to Heaven.\nWith the future so uncertain, De Morgan places the importance of spiritual fulfilment and happiness at the centre of much of her work. InBlindness and Cupidity Chasing Joy from the City(1897), for example, \"Cupidity\" is personified as a crowned figure clutching treasures who is driving away \"Joy\" in the form of an angel. Here, as in Death of the Dragon, the central characters are chained, suggesting trapped souls.\nInThe Prisoner(1907-1908), the barred window and a woman's chained wrists make captivity a metaphor for gender inequality, hinting at the De Morgans' support foruniversal suffrage(Evelyn was a signatory of at least two important petitions, while her husband was vice-president of the Men's League for Women's Suffrage). The theme recurs inLuna(1885), where the rope-bound body of a moon goddess, a mythological figure of feminine power, functions as a metaphor for a woman's struggle to influence her own destiny.\nChristened \"Mary\", Evelyn later adopted her then-gender-neutral middle name, as women's art was not taken seriously. \"She wanted to be considered on the same level as her male peers,\" says McMeakin. \"We can assume a huge degree of self-possession and determination in her desire to become a professional artist,\" she adds, making the point that even De Morgan's mother opposed her career choice.\nTechnically, De Morgan was also a pioneer. She experimented with burnishing and rubbing gold pigment into her works to add depth and interest, and explored new painting techniques invented by her husband, made by grinding colours with glycerine and spirit. Stylistically, she was also ahead of her time. The unconventional use of pinks and purples, and the bold rings of rainbow-coloured light, prefigure thepsychedelic painting stylesof the 1970s, while her terrifying monsters would not look out of place incontemporary fantasy art.\nWhile art history has tended to paint women as virgin mothers, objects of beauty or temptresses, De Morgan's specifically female perspective recasts them as figures of hope that augur an alternative, brighter future. InLux in Tenebris(light in darkness) (1895), for example, the female figure holds an olive branch in her right hand, offering a pathway to peace. In Death of the Dragon, the angel is surrounded by a magnificent rainbow: a symbol (along with the sky) of joy that denotes spiritual fulfilment and freedom, as well as the promise of an afterlife.\nIt's a mistake to think of works such as Death of the Dragon as \"completely bleak\", argues McMeakin, noting that \"often with [her] apocalyptic scenes, there is a glimmer of hope, or a part of the painting that is calm\". In many ways, Death of the Dragon is optimistic, expressing a sense that the war – the metaphorical dragon – is nearing its end, and that good can overcome evil. In this existential battle, De Morgan saw a place for her work. When she was aged  just 17, she chastised herself for not painting enough. \"Art is eternal, but life is short,\" she wrote in her diary. \"I will make up for it now, I have not a moment to lose.\"\nEvelyn De Morgan: The Modern Painter in Victorian Londonis at the Guildhall Art Gallery, London until 4 January 2026.\nIf you liked this storysign up for The Essential List newsletter, a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,X, andInstagram"

    "content": "Tragedy Titus Andronicus is the Bard's goriest work, and a new production is set to be one of the most extreme takes on it yet. It raises the question: why do we watch such brutality?\nGood theatre has the power to really move us – a statement that's usually taken metaphorically, rather than literally. Yet when it comes to Shakespeare's bloodiest play, Titus Andronicus, its impact can be so visceral it causes audience members to faint. I should know: while reviewing a production atShakespeare's Globein London, back in 2014, its disturbingly violent scenes caused me to start to feel light-headed, even while safely sat down in my seat. Unfortunately, it was a bench with no back: before the end of the first half, I had fainted away completely, falling backwards and waking up in a stranger's lap.\nWarning: this article contains some graphic descriptions of violence\nAnd I was far from the only person to have such a full-bodied response to Lucy Bailey's production of this gory revenge tragedy: the press went wild forstories of \"droppers\", with more than 100 people fainting during the run – testament to the immense power of Shakespeare's writing, and the skill of performers, as well as to the props department's handling of litres of fake blood.\nOne of the Bard's earliest plays, written in 1591-2, and almost certainly his first tragedy, Titus Andronicus is a story of violent vengeance: Titus, a general of Rome, returns from wars against the Goths with their queen, Tamora, and her sons held as captives. When her eldest son is sacrificed by Titus, Tamora swears revenge – setting in motion a series of increasingly brutal acts that ends  with an infamous scene involving the baking of pies... Boasting 14 deaths, it is the most violent of all Shakespeare's plays – and now it's back on stage, with a new production opening at the UK's Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon.\nThe play's unavoidable ultra-violence has meant that, for much of the performance history of Shakespeare – whose birthday is today – Titus Andronicus was considered a bit of an embarrassment, a bloody stain on his reputation: too gruesome, too over-the-top, to be considered in the same category of greatness as, say, Hamlet or Othello. Then there's its sometimes queasy tone: the excesses can tip Titus into a gleefully macabre, manic comedy (an aspect also embraced in Bailey's gore-fest). Let's just say, the Victorians were not fans.\nBut the play's reputation began to revive in the second half of the 20th Century. At the Royal Shakespeare Company alone, there have been several seminal productions in the past 70 years, starring Laurence Olivier (1955), Patrick Stewart (1981), Brian Cox (1987) and David Bradley (2003), while Anthony Hopkins playing Titus on screen in Julie Taymor's influential, blackly funny film version in 1999 also surely helped boost the play's standing. Some of these productions leaned heavily on the horror, too: there were fainters and walk-outs in Deborah Warner's unflinching 1987 production, which Coxonce claimedwas the most interesting play he'd done and the best stage performance he'd ever given. But he also pointed to the odd humour of the play, calling it \"a young man's play… full of energy, joie de vivre and laughter that often strikes people as ludicrous\".\nTitus is notalwaysstaged with grisly literalness: in the Olivier-starring production by Peter Brook, the mutilation of Titus's daughter Lavinia was famously suggested with stylised red streamers – an aestheticised approach also used in the Japanese Ninagawa Company's production in the 2000s. More recently, Jude Christian's all-female 2023 production in London's candle-lit Sam Wanamaker Playhouse enacted the violence on candles themselves, with cast members stabbing, snapping or snuffing them.\nIn the latest production of Titus Andronicus, however, there will be blood. Buckets of it. \"We are doing gallons of blood. We've made a sort of wet room [on stage], it's got a drainage system and an abattoir hook…\" says Max Webster, the play's director, over a video call from Stratford-upon-Avon. He's had to figure out how to stage no fewer than 27 different acts of onstage violence, from punches through to limbs being lopped off and tongues being cut out. And the only limit on the amount of gore sloshing around is the practical question of how to clean it up between scenes. \"It's an unbelievably boring thing about how many crew members and squeegees it takes,\" laughs Webster. \"In one sentence, you're thinking 'what is the meaning of tragedy in relation to human nature?' – and then very quickly you get into 'how many mops can the crew hold?'.\"\nWebster, whose acclaimed productions include an adaptation of Booker Prize winner Life of Pi and a recent David Tennant-starringMacbeth, wanted to direct Titus Andronicus for one simple reason: Simon Russell Beale, one of Britain's greatest Shakespearean actors, asked him to. Titus was a part that Russell Beale fancied a crack at, and the RSC was happy to oblige. This version is updated – set in a crisp, besuited modern world riven by conflict, although where exactly is kept deliberately vague.\n\"It's trying to be open – we're not setting it in Kosovo or Gaza or Sudan,\" says Webster, adding swiftly \"And we're not going to try to produce the US army onstage or something – it's trying to make sense of Rome as a 'superpower of empire' rather than as 'the United States of America'.\" Still, he sees Titus as freshly, troublingly relevant, in light of shocking events such as the 7 October Hamas attacks, the war in Gaza, and the sudden invasion of Russian troops into Ukraine, the story's extreme violence doesn't seem so unimaginable.\nIn this production, the violence is certainly no laughing matter. In rehearsals, they have been playing it entirely seriously, and eschewing the blackly cartoonish or stylishly Tarantino-esque approach to the violence that some directors explore. This has risks: Webster fully expects that, when the show is in front of an audience, there may be some nervous laughter; it'll be their job in previews to figure out where these laughs form a necessary \"pressure release valve\", and where they're really just a sign to make the show even more harrowing.\nFor Webster, it isn't possible to laugh at the brutality of Titus Andronicus in 2025 – it's too real. He sees the play as \"a howl of pain\"; watching it becomes an act of witness, an attempt to face up to atrocities taking place right now – something that he acknowledges could be hard for an audience. \"I can walk down the Avon [river], and know my family is safe and it doesn't feel like the world is burning. But you look at other parts of the world… these horrors, that maybe feel historical to us, are actually happening.\"\nBut Titus Andronicus isn't a documentary; it's an old play, that people choose to stage and choose to pay to go to see. So why, when we could just watch the news, do we opt to watch such harrowing content as art, as entertainment? It's a question that partly motivated Russell Beale to do Titus,he told The Guardianlast week: \"I don't understand the violence. I don't understand why as an audience we feel excited, stimulated, challenged by it; it's so relentless.\"\nIt may have been shunned in later centuries, but Titus Andronicus's original audiences loved it – and many other forms of graphically horrible entertainment, from bear baiting to public hangings. Titus was a hit in Elizabethan England, and in writing it Shakespeare may, in fact, have been playing to the crowd: it resembles the super-violent revenge tragedies that were popular at the time, rarely-staged works such as Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy and Thomas Middleton's The Revenger's Tragedy. Such plays were, themselves, drawing inspiration from the incredibly bloody and outrageous tragedies written by Seneca in the First Century AD – including Thyestes, a source of direct inspiration for Shakespeare, where the title character is fed a pie made of the flesh of his own children. And obviously, Ancient Greek tragedies – even if they keep acts of violence off-stage – are a rich and enduring source of creative murders of family members and cycles of bloody revenge.\nSuch tragedies, Webster points out, had their origins in ritual performances of sacrifice. \"I guess theatre came out of killing goats in Ancient Greece… there's always been some relationship between theatre and violence and the sacred stuff.\"\nMore like this:\n•Edward II: Did a gay love affair spark a royal crisis?\n•The Shakespeare words you don't know you know\n•The Shakespeare tragedy that speaks to us now\nIt does seem that watching the very worst things imaginable unfolding has an irresistible appeal – not only do we still return to Greek or Shakespearean tragedies, but we've also turned death and violence into major sources of entertainment, apparently appropriate for daily consumption. Horror films, true crime podcasts, police procedurals, first-person shooter video games… depictions of very, very bad things happening to bodies are pervasive across all art forms, all the time. You might even say we're addicted to the adrenaline shot we get from such emotionally-wringing, extreme forms of entertainment:research showsthat the blood-pumping, heart-racing high we get from fear is close to the pleasurable bodily experience of excitement.\nFrom the high body count of fantasy shows likeGame of ThronesandHouse of the Dragonto the dystopian chills ofSquid Gameto the seemingly endless appetite for the torture porn movies of the Saw franchise, much of our creative output would make Seneca smack his lips in approval. But beyond the potential physical thrills, why are we so drawn to watching such violent content?\nWhen I ask Webster, he's as unsure as Russell Beale. \"The truth is, I don't know. But thereisa lust to watch violence on-stage – it is a basic human urge.\" He wonders if it forms a safe outlet for our innate human darkness. And a common theory as to why we enjoy the terrors of a horror movie or the bleakness of a dystopian novel is just this: that such fictional outings are a secure way for us to rehearse terrible acts – without ever having to experience those in real life. \"Maybe it is so we don't have to do [violence] in our lives?\" Webster ponders. \"We all have these weird, dark, turbulent fantasies that we don't talk about because they're not socially acceptable… so maybe seeing it on-stage is an escape, or a relief?\"\nThe academics Haiyang Yang and Kuangjie Zhang confirm Webster's theory, sharing research in theHarvard Business Reviewthat found that horror entertainment \"may help us (safely) satisfy our curiosity about the dark side of human psyche… As an inherently curious species, many of us are fascinated by what our own kind is capable of. Observing storylines in which actors must confront the worst parts of themselves serves as a pseudo character study of the darkest parts of the human condition.\"\nIf I'm honest, the news that there's so much blood in Webster's Titus Andronicus that they need a drain on stage has got me nervous of watching the show, rather than gleefully ready to excise my inner demons. Is he worried that this Titus might be so powerful – so bloody, and so upsetting – that people will faint? He is not. \"It's important you provide a content warning, and then people can make an informed decision about if they want to see it,\" says Webster. \"If people faint, they faint.\"\nTitus Andronicusis at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 17 June\nHolly Williams novelThe Start of Somethingis out in paperback now\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

Just add chilli and salt.\" Uma informs her awkward groom, who has gone on a week-long drinking binge, that he \"stinks\" and tells her employers sarcastically when they offer her a cleaning job that she's \"a domestic goddess\".\nTold through offbeat dialogue, physical comedy and a punkish soundtrack that includes Iggy Pop, Sister Midnight presents a heroine unlike anything else filmed in India, according to Apte. \"I'd never read anything like it before and I couldn't put it down,\" she tells the BBC. \"I was completely taken by Uma, she was this crazy creature, and I didn't know why I resonated with her, but I just did. It was going to be a very thin line playing her between it being really cool and it going wrong. And that excited and challenged me. I also like how unapologetic Uma is and the more she accepts herself, the freer and stronger she becomes.\"\nUma is the latest character that offers a different kind of female protagonist to Indian viewers, one who differs markedly from the traditional Bollywood heroine. \"Bollywood\", the name for Hindi-language studio cinema, has historicallydominated the Indian box office, making around$1.36bn last year. But it's also been accused of being\"sexist and regressive\"in its attitude towards women. In 2023,a landmark study in Indiaexamined some of the country's biggest hits in terms of gender representation and sexual stereotyping, and found what they described as a \"formula\" to many of Bollywood's female characters.\n\"The female lead has to be thin and beautiful. She has to be coy and demure who expresses consent through gestures rather than words, but [she] wears sexually revealing clothing and has to be somewhat modern to allow for her to be in a pre-marital relationship which is a transgression,\" Professor Lakshmi Lingam, the project lead for the study,told the BBCat the time. \"There's very little attempt to do something different.\"\nThe depiction of both male and female characters on screen is important, she added, because \"in India, where families and schools rarely teach about sex education and consent, all our responses are influenced by books and cinema\".\nBy contrast, the male stars of thebiggest Bollywood filmsof 2023were described as\"led by alpha male protagonists with rippling muscles and blazing guns brandished on screen as they went on a bone-crunching rampage to vanquish their enemies\". The hit films included Shah Rukh Khan's Pathaan and Jawan, in which he plays a spy and vigilante, as well as the much-criticised, hyper-violent Animal, starring Ranbir Kapoor, a filmaccused of misogyny and objectifying women.It was made by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, whose previous film Kabir Singh showed the male leadopenly stalking and harassing a womanand was the second biggest Bollywood movie of 2019.\nThere have been hit films showing women in roles of authority, including female rocket scientists in Mission Mangal, also one of the most successful Bollywood films of 2019, and filmspraised for a modern perspective on gender roles, such as Karan Johar's Rocky aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani (Rocky and Rani's Love Story). But neverthelessShubhra Gupta, the film critic for daily newspaper The Indian Express, laments the lack of \"wriggle room\" India's leading ladies generally have in their roles.\n\"These heroines' overriding principle is demureness,\" she tells the BBC. \"You can have flashes of spirit, or you may speak your mind, but you'd also be just right in terms of beauty, and you'd be very clearly subservient to the leading man and whatever he is doing. You are pretty much always bringing up the rear, with a few scenes in which you get to shine.\"\nIn Sandhya Suri's recent drama Santosh, however, a Dalit woman (from the lowest caste in Indian society) is as a police officer, with the authority that brings. Santosh inherits her husband's police officer job when he dies in service, something that's possible on compassionate grounds for government employees in India. Santosh, played by Shahana Goswami, is an enigmatic character who finds corruption in her local police force when a young girl is raped and murdered. She has a female boss, played by film and TV actress Sunita Rajwar, who has learned to compromise to stay at the top.\nSuri, previously a documentary maker, says she was influenced in making it by the real-life gang rape and murder in 2012 of ayoung woman on a bus in Delhi, which made worldwide headlines and led to new lawsto safeguard women. (Despite that, sexual violence against women and girlsremains highin India, and a 2022 reportfound thatcruelty by a husband or his relatives remained the biggest crime against Indian women.)\n\"There were big protests at the time [of the rape and murder], and I saw the photo of a female cop being confronted by some very angry female protestors. I saw that image and I saw the expression on the cop's face, and it was so enigmatic that I was just very, very taken by it. It was so interesting. She was at both ends of power. There was the possibility of violence against her, but [it was] also possible for her to mete out violence as well with that uniform,\" Suri tells the BBC.\n\"I wanted to know if you took somebody like Santosh, shut up in the kitchen of her house, and you put her in that place, what's her response to that?\" she explains. \"I wanted to ask if there was a way to be a woman that's not about being a man, and not about being oppressed. Is there some other way in her society in which she can be, and that there may be a line she steps over?\"\nSantosh, which was made in Hindi, was the UK'sOscar entryfor best international film in 2025 – one attribute both Sister Midnight and Santosh share is that, though they were filmed in India, they're made byBritish Indian film-makers. Sister Midnight's makers hope to release it in India in 2025, but Suri tells the BBC that Santosh will almost certainly not get a cinema release there.\n\"We screened it at the Mumbai International Film Festival and had a great response, and I was moved by just how real the film felt to a local audience,\" she says. \"But it looks like the film won't release in India, sadly, as it was admitted to the censor board (CBFC) and there were so many cuts, I couldn't maintain some semblance of a film.\"\nIndian censorship decisions have frequently caused controversy: in 2017, thedecision to banthe feminist Indian movie Lipstick Under My Burkha for being \"too lady oriented\" caused an outcry, and was lateroverturnedafter negative publicity. But many homegrown blockbusters are self-censoring, especially when it comes to sex and sexuality.\nThe 2021 Telugu-language hit Pushpa: The Rise, the story of a smuggler,removed a scenewhere the hero Pushpa (played by Allu Arjun) touches the chest of the heroine, Srivalli, because of complaints from the audience. In 2024, Pushpa 2: The Rule again caused controversy in India, according to Shubhra Gupta, because of an insinuation that Srivalli (played by Rashmika Mandanna) might want to be sexually intimate with her husband.\n\"The [female] character acts very cute, she comes on to the hero and is very playful when she wants a little assignation,\" Gupta says of it. \"The rest of the film she's serving the hero. She wants her husband not to have sex with anyone else. But in fact, it became a real talking point in India because it's not something heroes or leading ladies in the movies are supposed to have conversations about.\n\"And our mainstream film experience is still very much that if a woman has a sexual experience outside marriage, there will be some castigation attached to it,\" she adds. \"She won't be 'pure' anymore, she'll be known as 'bold' which means she's been around.\"\nIt makes Payal Kapadia'sacclaimed filmAll We Imagine as Light seem more audacious in terms of its exploration of sex. The first ever Indian winner of the Cannes Film Festival's Grand Prix is the story of a nurse, Prabha, who's been abandoned in her arranged marriage. Meanwhile, her younger flatmate Anu, a Hindu, wants to get intimate with her Muslim boyfriend,itself another taboo. There's no talk of marriage in advance.\n\"The film's about the preoccupations I've had for some time,\" Kapadia tells the BBC. \"Women in India can be financially independent, but there is still not a lot of autonomy with what you choose to do with your personal life. It's infantilising women. You could be 25 years old, making your own money, providing for your family back home. But you can't decide who to be with or who to marry.\"\nDespite the accolades, All We Imagine as Light was not chosen as India's 2025 Oscar entry (the deciding jury called it \"a European filmtaking placein India\".) But it wasn't the only film by an Indian female director in 2024 that put a young woman's sexual awakening on screen – the English and Hindi language movie Girls Will Be Girls, by Shuchi Talati, won the audience award at the Sundance Film Festival. Set in a boarding school in the Himalayas, it's the story of an 18-year-old girl who falls in love with a boy for the first time, but whose romance is disrupted by her mother.\nBut Indian films breaking societal \"norms\" have found international recognition before, from Mira Nair'sMonsoon Wedding(2001), to Lipstick Under My Burkha (2016), and 2014's LGBTQ+ teenage love story, Margarita with a Straw. Shubhra Gupta says there's still a vast gap between what an international audience react to and what mainstream Indian audiences will pay to see,given the high ticket prices in cinemas.\n\"These films we're talking about are part of independent Indian film, which is really where all the exciting things happen, and that's pretty much true of all world cinema,\" she says. \"Payal Kapadia has had a fabulous journey with All We Imagine as Light, and it did get a cinema release here. But I'm not sure how much box office it made in India.\" She adds that many viewers in India would react in \"disbelief\" to heroines such as Sister Midnight's Uma and Santosh were they able to watch the movies, as they are so unconventional.\n\"They wouldn't be able to suspend disbelief that in Santosh, a Dalit woman from the lower caste, would be made into the lead, that she's driving the narrative. It would be such a hard sell here,\" she says. \"And Radhika Apte's character Uma is a wife, but she is not submissive. She goes out there and does all these mad things. They are excellent films that might do well on a streaming platform, or they will find a discerning audience – but a discerning audience doesn't really make up the numbers that a big budget Bollywood film will.\"\nBut Indian film-makers still have to try to break stereotypes for audiences, according to Tanushree Das and Saumyananda Sahi, the directors behind Bengali-language filmShadowbox. The film, shown at this year'sBerlin International Film Festival, is the story of Maya, (played by Tillotama Shome) who holds down several jobs and battles to keep her family going because her husband, a former soldier, struggles with his mental health and is frequently humiliated by the community because of it.\n\"When we're talking about working class underprivileged women, the term 'from the margins' tends to crop up,\" Das tells the BBC. \"But the 'margin' represents a huge majority of our population. Where are their stories, then? It's high time we broke stereotypes, and to do this more women need to tell their own stories. I feel producers and distributors of film underestimate how large a viewership women represent, and their appetite to see stories where their lives are mirrored rather than projected in a tokenistic way.\"\nIf cinema itself is not an option, the rise of the international streamers and OTT platforms (which allow viewers to watch content directly on their TV or through a phone app) during the Covid-19 pandemic has provided a place for recent, more audacious, female-focused film-making. The Great Indian Kitchen in 2021 by Jeo Baby, a Malayalam language film, became a hit on the app Neestream, and versions of the story were also made in Tamil and Hindi. It's the story of an arranged marriage, and the film shows, from a female viewpoint, household drudgery, unpleasant in-laws and monotonous and painful sex with an uncaring husband, with one female criticsaying of itthat \"the film rips through patriarchy, the bedrock of the institutions of family and religion.\"\nLaapataa Ladies, by Kiran Rao (which did become India's Oscar entry this year) also deals with an unwanted arranged marriage and was released on Netflix, as was 2020'sGunjan Saxena, which told the story of India's first ever female fighter pilot.\n\"But people are not actually buying a ticket for these,\" Gupta says. \"It's mostly 15-to 35-year-olds who are going to the movies, andoften they happen to be young men. And the film industry is still a boy's club to a large extent.\"\nFor more nuanced female characters to be seen in big-budget cinema films, ultimately Bollywood's lack of profits last year might be an impetus. After its bumper 2023, last year Bollywood only achieved40% of the overall Indian box office profits, and Gupta says its \"formulaic films\" are part of the problem. \"People are hungry for something different,\" she says. \"But the problem is, if you take them too far out of their comfort zone, I'm not sure whether they're going to come to the cinema. So unfortunately, we've ended up maintaining this equilibrium so that people will come to the movies not expecting to see women who are feminists, or women who do not ascribe to the idea of what a good woman should be.\"\nHowever, she adds, it's not just female characters who have to be written differently in order for change to come. \"I would say that if you want your women characters to be different, you also have to write your men differently too,\" says Gupta. \"There needs to be a cosmic shift across the board.\"\nSantosh and Sister Midnight are currently on release in the UK. Sister Midnight will be released in the US on 16 May 2025.\nIf you liked this storysign up for The Essential List newsletter, a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,X, andInstagram"

    "summary": "In April 1983, a British newspaper, The Sunday Times, claimed to be printing an extraordinary historical document. In fact, the forged diaries were an extraordinary hoax.",
    "content": "In April 1983, a German magazine, Stern, and a British newspaper, The Sunday Times, claimed to have made one of the century's most extraordinary historical discoveries. In fact, it was one of the century's most extraordinary hoaxes – and the scandal that followed cost millions and ruined reputations.\nOn 25 April 1983, 42 years ago this week, respected German magazine Stern published what they believed to be the most spectacular historical scoop: the previously unknown private diaries of Adolf Hitler. To show off their extraordinary exclusive to the world's press, the weekly news magazine had arranged a Hamburg press conference for the same day. The story would indeed dominate global headlines – but not in the way the magazine hoped.\nThree days earlier, Stern's London editor Peter Wickman had told BBC News that they were \"absolutely convinced\" that they had the authentic Hitler diaries in their hands. \"We were very dubious at the beginning, but we had a graphologist looking at them, we had an expert who compared the paper. We had historians like Professor Trevor-Roper, and they are all convinced they are genuine.\"\nThe handwritten journals ran from 1932 to 1945, covering the entire period of Hitler's Third Reich. \"There are 60 diaries, they look a bit like school exercise books but with a hard cover. They have seals outside with a swastika and an eagle and inside, of course, Hitler's very spidery gothic handwriting,\" Wickman told the BBC.\nStern believed that their discovery had the potential to rewrite what was previously known about the Nazi leader. And the diaries' content was certainly eye-opening, revealing a little-known sensitive side to the Führer. They detailed everything from Hitler's battles with flatulence and halitosis, and the pressure from his girlfriend Eva Braun to get Olympics tickets, to notes about sending Stalin – \"the old fox\" – a birthday telegram. The notebooks also seemed to indicate, somewhat startlingly, that the Nazi leader was unaware of the Holocaust that was being carried out in his name.\nThe journals had supposedly been unearthed by Stern journalistGerd Heidemann. The reporter was already regarded around Stern as something of a Nazi memorabilia obsessive. In 1973, the magazine had assigned him to write a story about a dilapidated yacht which had once belonged to Hitler's second-in-command, Hermann Göring. Heidemann spent a fortune buying the yacht and restoring it. He also began an affair with Göring's daughter Edda, who introduced him to a number of former Nazis. It was through these contacts, Heidemann said, that he had come across Hitler's diaries.\nHeidemann claimed that the plane had been carrying the diaries, which were salvaged from the crash and stowed away in a hayloft. In the intervening years, they had found their way to an East German collector who was now offering to sell them. The reporter would negotiate the deal to buy them, acting as intermediary between his East German source and Stern.\nThe promise of a sensational world exclusive, providing previously unknown insight into the mind of the Nazi dictator, proved irresistible to the magazine. But Stern was determined to keep a tight grip on who knew about their scoop, so when they hiredhandwriting expertsto authenticate the diaries – providing them with \"genuine\" Hitler documents for comparison – they would only give them a few selected pages of the notebooks to look at. Stern ultimately forked out some 9.3 million Deutschmarks (£2.3m) for the volumes, and, having paid such an exorbitant sum, opted to store them in a Swiss vault for safekeeping.\nThe first historian to examine the diaries was Prof Hugh Trevor-Roper, also known as Lord Dacre of Glanton. In 1947, he had written a book, The Last Days of Hitler, which had brought him a great deal of academic prestige, and he was regarded as a leading expert on the Nazi dictator. He was also an independent director of The Times newspaper, which two years earlier had been acquired along with its sister paper, The Sunday Times, byRupert Murdoch.\nLord Dacre was initially sceptical about the diaries, but flew to Switzerland to view them. His opinion began to be swayed when he heard the diaries' origin story and was told, erroneously, that chemical tests had found them to be pre-war. But what really tipped the balance for the historian was seeing the huge volume of material involved.\n\"The thing that struck Hugh Trevor-Roper most forcefully and certainly struck me as a non-expert when I saw the original material was the sheer scale of it,\" The Times editor Charles Douglas-Home told the BBC on 22 April 1983. \"The enormous range of this archive. It's not just that there are nearly 60 volumes of notebooks filled out in Hitler's longhand which is there, there are about 300 of his drawings and pictures and personal documents such as his party card. I remember there are the drawings which he submitted to art school when he was a young man hoping to get into art school, and there is a painting, an oil painting and so on. Now a forger would have to be very good to forge across that whole range.\"\nLord Dacre became convinced that the journals were genuine, even writing an article for The Times vouching for their authenticity and declaring that historic events might need to be re-evaluated in light of them. As word got out about the Hitler diaries, a bidding war developed over their serialisation rights, with The Sunday Times proprietor, Murdoch, flying over to Zurich to negotiate a deal in person.\nWith serialisation deals signed, Stern hastily planned a press conference to announce the publication of Hitler's diaries to the world. But even before the notebooks' grand reveal, doubts were being raised about their veracity – not least by the staff of The Sunday Times themselves, who had been burnt before. In 1968, the newspaper had made a down payment on diaries supposedly written by the Italian fascist leaderBenito Mussolini, which had also been vouched for, by his son no less. \"But they turned out to be fakes devised by two little old ladies who lived in Vercelli outside Milan,\" journalist Phillip Knightley, who worked for The Sunday Times's investigative team, toldWitness Historyin 2011.\nHowever, Murdoch was certain about the diaries and, despite the reservations of its editor, Frank Giles, rushed the serialisation into print in The Sunday Times with the headline \"world exclusive\" the day before Stern's press announcement.\nGiles rang Lord Dacre seeking reassurance about the story only to have the historian confess that he was not so much having doubts as making \"a 180-degree turn\" regarding the diaries' authenticity. \"Everybody in the room, all the newspaper executives slumped down in their chairs and put their heads in their hands because we had lost our principal authenticator,\" said Knightley. \"It was clear that the story was absolutely wrong.\"\nThe Sunday Times could still have stopped the presses and changed the front page. But when Giles rang the proprietor, \"Murdoch said, 'Just because Dacre has been vacillating for all this time, screw him, we'll publish,'\" recalls Knightley.\nFor Stern, things would just get worse at itsnews conferencethe next day. After editor-in-chief Peter Koch declared that he was \"100% convinced that Hitler wrote every single word in those books\", Lord Dacre, the very historian who had vouched they were the real deal, admitted under questioning that he was having second thoughts.\nTo the horrified looks of the Stern executives, Lord Dacre said that he wasn't able to establish a link between the plane crash and the alleged diaries and that he had been rushed into making a judgement. \"I must say as a historian, I regret that the normal methods of historical verification have, perhaps necessarily, been to some extent sacrificed to the requirements of the journalistic scoop,\" he said.\nMore like this:\n•The true story of The Great Escape\n•The British politician who faked his own death\n•How Oskar Schindler saved 1,200 Jewish people in WW2\nThe day after the chaotic press conference, Charles Hamilton, a US autographs dealer, told BBC Breakfast that as soon he saw the diaries' pages he \"could smell the ebullient odour of forgeries\". Hamilton said that he knew the signature wasn't authentic because he was constantly offered fake Hitler documents. \"Shortly it will be established without any question, and without any panel of experts which I think is superfluous at the present time, the whole affair will die down and it will be a great hoax in the history of mankind,\" he said.\nAnd he was not wrong. Within two weeks, rigorous forensic analysis had exposed the diaries as fakes. Not only, as Hamilton had pointed out to the BBC, was Hitler's supposed signature not accurate, but chemical testing revealed that their paper, glue and ink were not manufactured until after World War Two. The diaries were peppered with errors, modern-day phrases and historical inaccuracies, sometimes referring to information that Hitler could not have possibly known.\nIn the wake of these revelations The Sunday Times quickly abandoned its serialisation and printed an apology. Stern also publicly apologised for having fallen for the hoax.\nUnder pressure, Heidemann revealed that the East German source supplying the diaries wasKonrad Kujau– a counterfeiter who turned out to be the author of the works. Kujau was a skilled artist, but his forgeries were far from sophisticated. Seeking inspiration, he had plagiarised large parts of Max Domarus's book Hitler: Speeches and Proclamations 1932-1945, and as a result had copied word for word some of the chronological and factual mistakes in that book's first edition. To try to give the journals a more personal feel, he had imagined a more prosaic side to the Führer's life, throwing in entries like \"I can't even get off work and visit Eva\", \"Have to go to the post office, to send a few telegrams\", and \"Eva says I have bad breath\". Kujau had even struggled with the elaborate Gothic initials he used on the diary covers, accidentally sticking the initials FH to them instead of AH. He had then attempted to age the notebooks by merely pouring tea over them and bashing them on his desk.\nWhat helped with the initial authentication of the diaries was that Kujau was such a prolific forger of Nazi memorabilia that many of the \"genuine\" documents Stern had given to experts, to enable them to compare Hitler's handwriting, had actually also been produced by Kujau himself. He was arrested by the police and admitted to his role in the hoax. He even went so far as to demonstrate his guilt by writing his confession in the style of Hitler's handwriting. In 1985, he was found guilty of fraud and forgery and sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison.\nOn further investigation, the police found Heidemann had also inflated the prices he said his source was requesting for the diaries, and had been skimming money off the top of the sums paid by Stern. He seems to have done this to fund his lavish lifestyle, the upkeep of his Nazi yacht and his penchant for buying ever more dictators' memorabilia (he would later claim to possess Idi Amin's underwear). He, like Kujau, was convicted in 1985 of fraud and was sentenced to four years, eight months. At his trial, Heidemann maintained that he too had been duped, but Kujau always insisted that the reporter knew the diaries were fakes.\nIn the fallout from the scandal,Lord Dacre's reputationas a historian would be permanently tarnished. Koch and another of Stern's editors would lose their jobs, while Giles would be removed from his role as The Sunday Times editor. Even Murdoch would later claim tothe Leveson Inquiryinto media ethics in 2012 that his decision to run with the story \"was a major mistake I made, I take full responsibility for it. I will have to live with it for the rest of my life.\"\nHowever, his newspaper's circulation was boosted by his decision to print the false story. And since Murdoch had insisted on a clause that Stern return all the money paid to it by The Sunday Times if the diaries were shown to be fake, the media mogul would only profit financially from the hoax.\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to theIn History newsletter, whileThe Essential Listdelivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "It may be set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, but Tony Gilroy's Star Wars series takes a key plot from a real robbery masterminded by Stalin in an Imperial Russian city. And Andor has as much to do with our world as it has with Stalin's.\nIt has all the makings of the perfect heist.\nThe scheme takes place far from the imperial seat of power, on the wild fringes of an empire almost too vast to comprehend. Fuelled with revolutionary zeal, the plotters are a rag-tag outfit of men and women that includes thieves, murderers and turncoats. Their prize? A treasure chest of cash that can fund ever-more-ambitious missions against the hated ruling elite.\nIf you watched the first season of the Star Wars spin-off TV seriesAndor,you'll recognise this plot as one of the high points. Over three episodes, anti-hero Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and his band of accomplices hide out in mountain passes on the planet Aldhani, fine-tuning an audacious smash-and-grab from an Imperial garrison which is storing the wages of an entire sector.\nThe real-life theft that inspired it was also a long, long time ago, just not quite so far away.\nIt took place in Yerevan Square in what was then the imperial Russian city of Tiflis, now the Georgian capital Tblisi, on 26 June 1907. A shipment of cash for the city's Russian state bank branch, amounting to some 300,000 roubles ($1m at the time), was stolen by a gang of robbers linked to the Bolshevik revolutionary movement. Using bombs and guns, the gang left a scene of utter devastation in their wake; some 40 people were killed and dozens more injured. The news of the brazen daylight attack made headlines across the world.\nThe heist was the brainchild of a charismatic cobbler's son-turned-revolutionary called Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili. He was a gifted public speaker, an ex-seminary student, a romantic poet rumoured to have left a string of broken hearts in his rakish wake. He often went by the name \"Soso\" (which he had used when writing poems for local publications), though in years to come he would become far better-known – and feared – as Joseph Stalin.\nYes, the troubled outlaw beloved by Star Wars fans everywhere is based in part on one of history’s most notorious mass murderers, as the series' creator, Tony Gilroy, has acknowledged. \"If you look at a picture of young Stalin, isn’t he glamorous,\" Gilroy said in an interview inRolling Stone in 2022.\"He looks like Diego!\"\nStalin took Russia from its war-ravaged imperial decline to a nuclear-armed superpower in just three decades, but also presided over a reign of authoritarian terror that starved, executed or imprisoned millions of its own citizens. Countless books had been written on his cruel years in power, but very little on his early years. Writer Simon Sebag Montefiore saw a gap, and began rifling through archives in post-Soviet countries to try and separate the truth from myth, and tell the little-known story of Stalin's early life.\nIn 2007 – a century after the infamous heist in Tiflis –Young Stalinwas published. It delved into the early life of the Soviet Union's dictatorial leader. \"Should the life of a black-hearted ogre, a mass murderer who was the wickedest of the 20th-Century's monsters, be quite so entertaining,\"asked a review in The Observer at the time.\nOne person who read Young Stalin was Gilroy. The writer and producer, who had scripted the first four Bourne films and the Andor-precursor film,Rogue One, was planning a TV series that would explore Cassian Andor's journey from casual thief to rebellious figurehead. The true story of a revolutionary movement on the far fringes of a real empire gave Gilroy his source material. \"Literally, I’m the classic old white guy who just can’t get enough history,\" Gilroy said in Rolling Stone. \"The last 15 years, I’ve been reading all non-fiction.\" He added that Young Stalin was \"an amazing book\" and that its account of the Tiflis bank robbery was an \"incredible movie sequence\".\nDid Sebag Montefiore ever think to himself, 'Here's the perfect setting for a Star Wars spin-off,' when he was researching his book? \"No, I didn't ever think that when I was toiling in the archives in Moscow and Tbilisi,\" he tells the BBC. \"But I did think that there was something pretty elemental about the life of Stalin, especially before 1917. It was a fascinating story, partly because no one knew about it.\"\nThe Tiflis heist was reported around the world and funded the revolutionaries' movement for years, says Sebag Montefiore. \"Lenin and the whole Bolshevik Party lived off that money until the [1917] revolution.\"\nSebag Montefiore says that the young Stalin and the troubled Andor bear striking similarities: \"A young man from nowhere with a revolutionary ideology, and a fight against a huge empire,\" the writer says. \"I did think there was something interesting about the secret life of someone in that situation. That's basically what Tony Gilroy has focused on in Andor.\"\nStalin was, of course, not the only figure fomenting turmoil in Tsarist Russia, and Andor fleshes out other characters with attributes from the young Georgian's contemporaries. Among Andor's co-conspirators in the Aldanhi heist is Karis Nemik (Alex Lawther), an idealist writing a high-minded manifesto for the emerging resistance, similar to Bolshevik Leon Trotsky's polemics amid the opulent decline of Romanov rule.\nStellan Skarsgård's character, Luthen Rael, is an analogue for Vladimir Lenin, the Bolshevik leader who was able to form a powerful movement from unlikely bedfellows. A wealthy art collector, Luthen's precise manners in front of his gilded customers hide an uncompromising hatred of the empire and a restless desire to fund a growing resistance. In Cassian's talented, taciturn thief he sees a useful tool; Lenin saw the same in Stalin. \"In 1911, people said to Lenin, 'Why are you using this guy? He's a gangster. He's had people killed. He was involved in all these bank robberies,'\" says Sebag Montefiore. \"And Lenin replies, 'He's exactly the type we need.' Stalin could edit a paper. He could write and could read. And he was also someone who could arrange a hit on somebody and arrange a bank robbery. That was what Lenin talked about: some people were tea drinkers, and other people were thugs, Stalin could do both, and that's why Stalin won in the end.\"\nThe research into historical rebellions – Gilroy has said he studied other revolutions while writing Andor, as well – has no doubt helped create the show's oddly realistic feel. Andor feels more down to earth than anything the Star Wars universe has shown us before, if you'll excuse the occasional spaceship roaring overhead, or an alien or two sitting in the local bar. There are flashes of mundane detail rarely scene in big-budget sci-fi. People complain that Andor's mother Maarva's (Fiona Shaw) house is always too cold. Security officer Syril Karn's (Kyle Soller) petulant intensity even extends to tailoring his uniform to make him look smarter than his contemporaries. The Imperial Security Bureau hoping to root out the emerging rebellion is a nest of competing ambitions that feels as real as anything in a historical drama – or in everyday office politik. There are fewer blaster-toting Stormtroopers than there are in the Star Wars films, and more sadistic, trenchcoated officers who would have been right at home in the Tsarist secret police, the Okhrana, or its Soviet replacement, the Cheka.\n\"In the past, Star Wars movies drop us in at a very big moment,\" says Walter Marsh, an Australian writer whopraised Andor's grown-up worldview in The Guardian in 2022. \"There's the big climactic battle, or Luke Skywalker's heroic journey, and they're these big themes of good versus evil. But as any historian will tell you, wars and empires and revolutions don't start and end overnight, and there's always this bigger backstory. There's this sort of long tail. It takes years for that kind of colonial rot, those systems of control, to set in.\"\nMore like this:\n•The Japanese film that Star Wars stole from\n•The truth about Henry VIII's right-hand man\n•Black Mirror's most 'devastating' episode ever\nAndor shows the corruption and brutal entitlement found at every layer of autocratic regimes: the guards drinking in a brothel while they're supposed to be on duty (and prepared to shake down anyone they don't like the look of); the prison industrial system that requires constant additions even if the new prisoners have done nothing wrong; the subtle sabotage of ethnic pilgrimages to sacred land that is earmarked for imperial development. And withauthoritarianism on the risearound the globe, Andor has as much to say about today's world as it does about Stalin's.\n\"When the show came out I think I was pleasantly surprised to see a story in that universe that was familiar, but which also approached this question of empire that's been so central to the whole franchise, but was never actually tackled in a really nuanced and human character-driven way,\" Marsh tells the BBC. \"It's all well and good to have a big, evil Sith Lord achieve global, universal domination. But how does power assert itself on the street level, from one human to another?\n\"The Empire is this huge grinding, unthinking machine, but it's also a very human thing,\" Marsh continues. \"Who are the people that find a place and thrive in those systems?\" He remarks that in the original films the Imperials were little more than blank-and-you-miss-them pantomime villains: \"British guys in suits getting choked by Darth Vader at some point, who are just fiddling with buttons in the background.\"\nAndor's strength is its \"three-episode arcs that showed us the kind of death by a thousand cuts that it takes to achieve this sort of social, political and economic dominance\", says Marsh. \"The converse of that is it shows all the ways in which that kind of oppression inspires pushback and resistance in all kinds of different ways.\"\nThe new season, which begins on Tuesday 22 April, will develop the rebellion's story as it rushes towards the events seen in Rogue One: the scenes of brutal Imperial reactions to a demonstration shown in the trailer evoke the Tsarist crackdown on a St Petersburg march in 1905, which was a  slow-burning contributor to the Bolshevik revolution.\n\"The scavenger who becomes a passionate revolutionary leader is kind of fascinating,\" says Sebag Montefiore of the troubled Cassian Andor. \"That's a great trajectory, because that's exactly what Stalin did. And it'll be interesting to see how deep Gilroy uses that – how far he goes to create a character with both heroic and villainous features.\"\nGeorge Lucas's original film trilogy rooted the rebellion in the classic good-guys-versus-bad-guys dynamic of countless Saturday matinee cliffhangers, the resistance modelled after anti-Nazi opposition in occupied Europe. The rebels of Andor inhabit a much more compromised reality; like real-life revolutionary movements, they are much more complicated than the ones we usually see on screen. Luthen, Andor's Lenin proxy, considers it with chilling deliberation in one of the first season's standout scenes: \"I'm condemned to use the tools of my enemy to defeat them. I burn my decency for someone else's future. I burn my life to make a sunrise that I know I’ll never see.\"\nAs Sebag Montefiore notes, the revolutionaries themselves knew deep down that if they took power, they themselves would have to use repression as a tool; they would become what they once despised. \"Lenin himself said: 'A revolution without firing squads is meaningless.'\"\nAndor season two is available on Disney+ from 22 April.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "As museums around the world celebrate the 250th birthday of JMW Turner, it's time to reappraise his beloved and celebrated painting, The Fighting Temeraire.\nJMW Turner's The Fighting Temeraire became a national celebrity when it was first unveiled in 1839, and its fame has endured to the present day. It was once votedBritain's favourite paintingand currently features on£20 banknotes. But the widely accepted interpretation of this iconic painting's message might, in fact, contradict Turner's true intentions.\nThe \"Temeraire\" of the title refers to a 98-gun warship of the British Navy, which is depicted in the painting's background. It was a hero in Britain's defence against France during the Napoleonic Wars, but it caught the nation's attention in 1838 when it was dismantled and its parts sold off. Turner's painting depicts this once-mighty gladiator of the seas being towed down a burnished River Thames by a much more recently invented steam-powered tugboat.\nA brief segment in the 2012 James Bond filmSkyfallcaptures a popular view about the painting. In the scene, Bond (Daniel Craig) meets Q (Ben Whishaw), his new head of research and development, in London's National Gallery, and they sit in front of The Fighting Temeraire. \"It always makes me feel a little melancholy\", says the young, tech-savvy Q, in a pointed jibe to 007, an old-school field agent. \"A grand old warship being ignominiously hauled away for scrap.\"\nThis echoes the widely held belief that the painting evokes a sense of nostalgia and faded national glory. According to this view, the ghostly Temeraire is the painting's heroine, and the tugboat its villain. In the 19th Century, the English writer William Makepeace Thackeray referred to the smaller vessel as \"a little, spiteful, diabolical steamer\" and the American novelist Herman Melville called it \"a pygmy steam-tug\" by comparison to the \"Titan Temeraire\".\nYou can see why Turner's original audience may have sympathised with the humbled HMS Temeraire and been saddened by her fate. Back in 1804, she had played a critical role in blockading French ports and defending the British coast. But her finest moment came on the afternoon of 21 October 1805, in the Atlantic Ocean, just off the coast of south-west Spain.\nAt this pivotal hour, the Battle of Trafalgar, a deadly sea battle between the British Royal Navy and the combined fleets of Spain and France, was at its climax. Admiral Lord Nelson's flagship HMS Victory had led the attack but was being pummelled by the French vessel Redoubtable. Then, out of the cannon smoke, surged HMS Temeraire, followed by a war-hungry flotilla of British vessels. The Temeraire blasted the Redoubtable with her guns and endured a hailstorm of cannon volleys in return – an onslaught that lacerated the ship and spattered her decks with blood. But like a stalwart prize-fighter, the Temeraire weathered the bout. She valiantly protected her flagship and played a vital part in the British navy's ultimate victory in the Battle of Trafalgar.\nTurner was 64 when he painted The Fighting Temeraire. He was born in 1775 in a down-at-heel area of London near Covent Garden but managed to enrol at the prestigious Royal Academy of Arts aged 14. He became an Academician at the precocious age of 24, and a Professor of Perspective when he was just 32. But although he rubbed shoulders with the great and the good, he refused to soften his Cockney accent or refine his manners. He was also fiercely entrepreneurial – he opened his own private gallery, sought wealthy patrons, and was always on the lookout for captivating and lucrative new artistic projects that might have widespread appeal. On one level, The Fighting Temeraire achieves his desire for broad popularity by harnessing people's sense of national pride.\nBut there's an even more important message to learn from the painting than its patriotism and sentimentality. It concerns that much maligned tugboat: the true focal point of the painting.\nSteam power was the new mechanical wonder of Turner's age, and his attitude to this recent technology was much more complicated than Thackeray, Melville or Q recognised. In other Turner artworks, like Snow Storm – Steam-Boat (1842) and Rain, Steam and Speed (1844), you can see his fascination with modern machinery and its transformative influence on individual experience, the environment, and society as a whole. This is in stark contrast with Turner's great rival John Constable, whose parents were from the elite, and whose paintings tended to overlooksome of the most seismic changesthat were reshaping the British Isles at the time.\nIn Constable's iconic 1821 painting The Hay Wain, an archaic cart rolls gently away from the viewer into a bucolic English landscape. Turner's The Fighting Temeraire gives us the exact opposite, putting the spectator on a collision course with the unstoppable force of industry.\nThis reflected contemporary reality. At the time The Fighting Temeraire was painted, the Royal Navy was increasingly using steamboats for towing bigger vessels. Moves were already afoot to replace its sail-powered fleet with new steam frigates. But the demise of the Temeraire didn't reflect a routine upgrade in armaments. This was a one-of-a-kind revolution in seafaring. Sailors around the world had relied on wind-and-sail or oar-propulsion for thousands of years. Now, steam engines could allow seafarers to overcome the vagaries of gusts, shallows and tidal patterns – to supersede nature itself. The future was steam-powered, but how this was going to affect the future of transport, trade and naval combat was still anybody's guess in the 1830s. What Turner did know was that as far back asHomer's Odyssey, sailing functioned as a profound symbol of the life journey in art and literature. And so, by hitching the old and the new so unforgettably in his painting, he shows us a compelling metamorphosis – the beginning of a new, post-industrial lifecycle in human history.\nTurner was awake to the responsibility of artists in times of irreversible historical change. For him, the age-old skill of depicting wooden sailing ships, their rigging, sails and ornately carved figureheads was becoming obsolete. The challenge for every artist (and every member of society) in the modern age, he realised, was to discover beauty and significance in newness, and in artefacts that had not previously been depicted in art, like iron funnels, pistons, valves, and paddle wheels. In The Fighting Temeraire, his rise to this challenge is captured in a very memorable and uncompromising symbol.\nMore like this:\n•The forgotten Monet finally getting her moment\n•The schmaltzy paintings that divided the US\n•The surprising story of Van Gogh's guardian angel\nTurner even adapted his painting technique to express the technological and social transformations in the world around him. He used newly invented paint hues like Lemon Yellow and Scarlet Lake in The Fighting Temeraire. Pigment analysis of the painting also indicates that he raided from his kitchen for substances to add his paint to achieve desired effects, like tallow, cooking fat or even salad oil.\nHis interest in new technology, and his search for innovative techniques with which to represent them, had a direct impact on the next generation of avant-garde painters. Claude Monet and Camille Pissarro were both wowed by Turner's art. An engraving of Turner's Rain, Steam and Speed (which depicts a train hurtling over Maidenhead bridge) was even displayed atthe first Impressionist Exhibition in Paris in 1874– a pivotal event in the history of modern art.\nIn 2025 various exhibitions will celebrate the 250th anniversary of Turner's birth, from Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool (Turner: Always Contemporary), to Turner's House in Twickenham (Turner's Kingdom: Beauty, Birds and Beasts), and from the Yale Centre for British Art, Connecticut (JMW Turner: Romance and Reality) to Tate Britain (Turner and Constable). But to fully appreciate this extraordinary artist, it's important to grasp the true meaning of his masterpiece, The Fighting Temeraire.\nFrequently it's been accepted as a melancholy image, a forlorn lament for past glories and a lost way of life. But this misses its essential point. The Fighting Temeraire is really about transformation and the inevitability of change rather than nostalgia. The most important lessons to learn from The Fighting Temeraire are about Turner's attitude and outlook. It embodies his refusal to be daunted by newness or enslaved by traditional artistic values. His quest to find the beauty and grandeur of modern experience, and leave the past behind, is magnificently on display in The Fighting Temeraire. And these qualities are truly his lasting legacy to modern art.\nThe 250th anniversary of JMW Turner's birth is on 23 April 2025.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "summary": "Twelve suspects were put on trial in April 1964. More than a decade later, several of them talked to the BBC about the notorious heist.",
    "content": "Britain in the 1960s was captivated by the daring of the Great Train Robbery, and the sheer scale of the money stolen. But when the accused men stood trial in April 1964, the judge was determined to send a message that such crimes would not be tolerated. Fourteen years later, several of the convicts talked to the BBC.\nOn 16 April 1964, Robert Welch was one of the 12 men found guilty of a notorious heist in Aylesbury Crown Court. Fourteen years later, in 1978, he was on the BBC's documentary and current affairs programme, Man Alive, and recalled seeing local dignitaries jostle for positions in the courtroom to hear the sentencing. \"This was what they had all come to watch. The climax of the play, the drama,\" Welch said. \"And the medieval setting in which we were sentenced, you know, it was a bit chilling.\"\nWelch and his fellow convicts had fallen a long way since pulling off one of the most audacious and lucrative thefts the UK had ever seen: the Great Train Robbery.\nWelch and his co-defendants were part of a band who held up a Royal Mail night train travelling from Glasgow to London. The robbers had made off with £2.6m in used banknotes, a record haul at that time, and the equivalent of over £50m ($65.8m) today. At the time of Welch's trial, police were still hunting for three of the people they suspected had been involved in the crime.\nTo execute this carefully orchestrated robbery,15 membersof two of London's biggest criminal gangs had worked together, each tasked with a particular role in the plot. \"They were regarded as the elite of the criminal world,\" Reginald Abbiss, who had covered the crime for the BBC as a young reporter,told the Witness History podcastin 2023. \"You had to have a certain talent and audacity, certain abilities to be able to pull a heist of this magnitude and they came together because they needed a multitude of talent.\"\nThedaring robberytook place just after 03:00 on 8 August 1963. The first step the criminals had taken was to cut the phone lines to stop an alarm being raised. They then rigged the train signals to stay red. \"They put a glove over the green light, they wired a cheap battery up to the red light and this, of course, meant the driver had to slow up,\" said Abbiss.\nSeeing the red light, the train's driver, Jack Mills, stopped the engine, and his co-driver, David Whitby, climbed out to use the trackside phone to find out what the problem was. That's when Whitby discovered that the line had been cut, and he was set upon by masked men wearing boiler suits. In the meantime, a masked robber burst into the train's cab to restrain the driver. When Mills tried to put up a fight, another gang member hit him over the head, rendering him semi-conscious.\n\"The one glitch, if you like, was the fact that the train driver… tried to resist,\" said Abbiss. \"One of the robbers hit him on the head with a cosh. A lot of blood and down he went.\"\nThe gang had been given inside information that the cash and high-value packages were held in the train's front two coaches. And because it was a Bank Holiday weekend, it would be carrying more money than usual.\nAlthough there weren't any police onboard, there were more than 70 Post Office employees, mostly in the rear carriages, where they were busy sorting letters. The criminals who had already familiarised themselves with the train's operation and layout quickly uncoupled the two money-laden carriages. The plan was to detach them and drive them away from the steep embankment to a predetermined rendezvous where it would be easier to unload the bags of cash.\nIt was then they hit a problem. \"They had a driver to drive the train, he couldn't get the train going, and they had to pull the original driver, Jack Mills, up from the floor and threaten him and say, 'Drive the train,'\" said Abbiss. \"He managed to get the train a mile up the line to where most of the gang were waiting, leaving the other eight or nine coaches with sorters happily sorting, totally unaware that the main part of the train had gone on ahead.\"\nMills, still bleeding profusely, was told to stop the two front carriages at Bridego Bridge. There, the rest of the gang broke into the carriages, overpowering the Post Office staff working in them, and forcing them to lie face down on the floor. They also brought in Mills and Whitby, who were handcuffed together.\nThe gang had decided that they would give themselves just 15 minutes to unload the loot and then leave whatever money was left. They formed a human chain and swiftly removed 120 sacks containing two-and-a-half tonnes of money into parked Land Rovers. After a quarter of an hour, the crew called time and ordered the terrified Post Office staff to stay still and not to attempt to contact the police for 30 minutes. Then the robbersdrove off into the night.\nThe boldness of the theft and the enormous sum of money involved captured the British public's imagination. In the weeks that followed, the country was gripped by sensational headlines detailing the police's hunt for the perpetrators. But despite the meticulous nature of the robbery's planning and its skilful execution, within a year the majority of the criminal gang had been rounded up and were facing trial.\n\"Well, at first view, the job was a very well-planned job,\" ex-Det Supt Malcolm Fewtrell, who led investigations into the heist, told BBC News in 1964. \"But in the event, it has been a disaster. They obviously weren't so clever as they thought they were.\"\nThe judge at their trial did not view the robbers' actions in the \"romantic\" way some of the public seemed to,saying that it would be \"positively evil\"if he showed the convicted men any semblance of leniency.\n\"I remember a shock wave ran through the courtroom when the judge, a man called Lord Justice Edmund Davies, handed down 307 years in the space of half an hour,\" Abbiss told BBC Witness History in 2023. At the time, the punishments they received for the robbery were some of the harshest in British criminal history, especially since nobody had been killed and no firearms had been used.\n\"I was just numbed, I couldn't think of anything but 30 years. When are we going to get out? We are never going to get out,\" one of the robbers, Tommy Wisbey, told Man Alive in 1978.\n\"I don't think it really hits you until a couple of days later and you realise what you've got,\" fellow gang member Gordon Goody said to the BBC. \"I mean it was a bit of a joke downstairs, clowning around and all that kind of thing. But deep down, I suppose you were sick.\"\nMore like this:\n•The British politician who was caught faking his own death\n•The true story of The Great Escape\n•The bizarre siege behind Stockholm Syndrome\nThe reason the judge gave for the severity of the prison terms was the assault on Mills. \"Anybody who has seen that nerve-shattered engine driver can have no doubt of the terrifying effect on law-abiding citizens of a concerted assault by armed robbers,\" said Justice Davies at the trial. Mills never worked again and died in 1970 of leukaemia. His co-driver Whitby died of a heart attack the following year at the age of 34.\nBut there was also a sense, at least among the robbers themselves, that they were being disproportionately punished because the heist had embarrassed the British establishment. One of them, Roy James, said to the BBC in 1978, \"At that moment, all the shame that was with me throughout the trial was lifted because I felt that Mr Edmund Davies then used his position as a High Court judge, used the backing of the state for vengeance. He put himself on a par with me and everything that he said I was.\"\n\"There was a feeling that Justice Davies came down particularly hard for two reasons,\" said Abbiss. \"One was the violence shown against the train driver, and the other was that the establishment, the government, the Post Office and British Rail, the way that they were sort of caught with their pants down. It showed the establishment to be people perhaps who take their eye off the ball.\"\nThe criminals' notoriety only grew following their sentencing when two of the gang made dramatic escapes from prison. Charles Wilson, who had been the treasurer of the group, broke out of jail just four months after the trial. He was recaptured in Canada after four years on the run and served another 10 years behind bars.Ronnie Biggsescaped from London's Wandsworth Prison, 15 months after his sentencing, using a makeshift rope ladder. He underwent plastic surgery and lived at times in Spain, Australia and Brazil, evading arrest for nearly 40 years. In 2001, he voluntarily returned to the UK for medical treatment and served the rest of his prison sentence.\nThe law would also eventually catch up with the three gang members who didn't stand trial that day. Bruce Reynolds, considered to be the robbery's mastermind, spent five years on the run until he was arrested on his return to England. He was sentenced to 25 years in jail, but ended up serving just 10. His son Nick, who spent his early life on the run with his father in Mexico and Canada, would later have his own link to the outlaw lifestyle when his band Alabama 3's song Woke Up This Morning became the opening theme of The Sopranos TV series.\nRonald \"Buster\" Edwards, who was later played by Genesis singer Phil Collins in a 1988 film, Buster, fled to Mexico following the robbery. He gave himself up in 1966 and was released after serving nine years. James White, who acted as the quartermaster for the robbery, was caught in Kent and sent to prison after three years on the run. He was released in 1975.\nDespite the lengthy jail time handed down, all the men convicted of the Great Train Robbery would end up being released early. None served more than 13 years for the crime – although many of them would return to prison for different offences in the years that followed.\nAs for the huge haul stolen during the robbery, despite the police in 1964 offering a 10% share for information that would lead them to it, the majority of the money was never recovered.\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to theIn History newsletter, whileThe Essential Listdelivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "summary": "After two planes collided, three hydrogen bombs hit a Spanish village, and one fell into the sea nearby. Two years later, villagers talked to the BBC about the terrifying accident.",
    "content": "In 1966, the remote Spanish village of Palomares found that the \"nuclear age had fallen on them from a clear blue sky\". Two years after the terrifying accident, BBC reporter Chris Brasher went to find what happened when the US lost a hydrogen bomb.\nOn 7 April 1966, almost 60 years ago this week, a missing nuclear weapon for which the US military had been desperately searching for 80 days was finally found. The warhead, with an explosive power 100 times that of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, was carefully winched from a depth of 2,850ft (869m) out of the Mediterranean Sea and delicately lowered onto the USS Petrel. Once it was on board, officers painstakingly cut into the thermonuclear device's casing to disarm it. It was only then that everyone could breathe a sigh of relief – the last of the four hydrogen bombs that the US had accidentally dropped on Spain had been recovered.\n\"This was not the first accident involving nuclear weapons,\" said BBC reporter Chris Brasher when he reported from the scene in 1968. \"The Pentagon lists at leastnine previous accidentsto aircraft carrying hydrogen bombs. But this was the first accident on foreign soil, the first to involve civilians and the first to excite the attention of the world.\"\nThis terrifying situation had come about because of a US operation code-namedChrome Dome. At the beginning of the 1960s, the US had developed a project to deter its Cold War rival, the Soviet Union, from launching a pre-emptive strike. A patrol of nuclear-armed B-52 bombers would continuously criss-cross the skies, primed to attack Moscow at a moment's notice. But to stay airborne on these long looping routes, the planes needed to refuel while in flight.\nOn 17 January 1966, one such bomber was flying at a height of 31,000ft (9.5km) over the Almería region of southern Spain, and attempted a routine air-to-air refuelling with a KC-135 tanker plane. \"I believe what happened was the bomber was closing at a too-high rate of closure speed and he didn't stabilise his position,\" US Maj Gen Delmar Wilson, the man in charge of dealing with the catastrophic accident, told Brasher, \"with the result that they got too close and collided.\"\nThe B-52 bomber's impact with the refuelling plane tore it open, igniting the jet fuel the KC-135 was carrying and killing all four of the crew onboard. The ensuing explosion also killed two men in the B-52's tail section. A third managed to eject, but died when his parachute did not open. The other four members of the bomber's crew successfully bailed out of their burning plane before it broke apart and fell to earth, raining down both flaming aircraft fragments and its lethal thermonuclear cargo onto the remote Spanish village of Palomares.\nThe huge fireball was seen a mile away. Thankfully, it did not trigger a nuclear explosion. The bomber's warheads were not armed and had built-in safeguards to prevent an unintended atomic chain reaction. But the thermonuclear devices did have explosives surrounding their plutonium cores as part of the triggering mechanism. In the event of an accident, the bombs had parachutes attached to them designed to cushion the impact on landing and prevent radioactive contamination. And indeed, one undetonated bomb did land safely in a riverbed and was recovered intact the following day. Unfortunately, two of the plummeting nuclear bombs' parachutes failed to open.\nThat morning, Spanish farmer Pedro Alarcón was walking to his house with his grandchildren when one of the nuclear bombs landed in his tomato field and blew apart on impact. \"We were blown flat. The children started to cry. I was paralysed with fear. A stone hit me in the stomach, I thought I'd been killed. I lay there feeling like death with the children crying,\" he told the BBC in 1968.\nThe other hydrogen bomb also exploded when it hit the ground near a cemetery. These dual blasts created vast craters and scattered highly toxic, radioactive plutonium dust across several hundred acres. Burning aircraft debris also showered the Spanish village. \"I was crying and running about,\" a villager called Señora Flores told the BBC in 1968. \"My little girl was crying, 'Mama, Mama, look at our house, it is burning.' Because of all the smoke I thought what she said must be true. There were a lot of stones and debris falling around us. I thought it would hit us. It was this terrific explosion. We thought it was the end of the world.\"\nOnce the news that the bomber had come down with nuclear weapons aboard reached US military command, a huge operation was launched. At the time of the disaster, Capt Joe Ramirez was an US Air Force lawyer stationed in Madrid. \"There were a lot of people talking, there was a lot of excitement in the conference room. Everyone kept talking about a 'broken arrow'. I learnt then that 'broken arrow' was the code word for a nuclear accident,\" he told BBC'sWitness Historyin 2011.\nUS military personnel were scrambled to the area by helicopter. When Capt Ramirez arrived in Palomares, he immediately saw the devastation and chaos wrought by the accident. Huge pieces of smoking wreckage were strewn all over the area – a large part of the burning B-52 bomber had landed in the school's yard. \"It's a small village but there were people scrambling in different directions. I could see smouldering debris, I could see some fires.\"\nDespite the carnage, miraculously no one in the village was killed. \"Nearly 100 tonnes of flaming debris had fallen on the village but not even a chicken had died,\" said Brasher. A local school teacher and doctor climbed up to the fire-scarred hillside to retrieve the remains of the US airmen who had been killed. \"Later still, they sorted the pieces and the limbs into five coffins, an act that was to cause a certain amount of bureaucratic difficulty when the Americans came to claim only four bodies from that hillside,\" said Brasher.\nThree of the B-52 crew who managed to eject landed in the Mediterranean several miles off the coast and were rescued by local fishing boats within an hour of the accident. The fourth, the B-52 radar-navigator, ejected through the plane's explosion, which left him badly burned, and was unable to separate himself from his ejection seat. Despite this, he managed to open his parachute and was found alive near the village and taken to hospital.\nHowever, this still left the problem of locating the plane's deadly nuclear payload. \"My main concern was to recover those bombs, that was number-one priority,\" Gen Wilson told the BBC in 1968.\n\"The first night, the Guardia Civil [the Spanish national police force] had come to the little bar in Palomares, and that was about the only place that had electricity. And they had reported what they considered to be a bomb, so we immediately despatched some of our people to this riverbed which is not far from the centre of town, and, in fact, it was a bomb, so we placed a guard on that. And then the next morning, at first daylight, we started conducting our search, and I believe it was something in the order of 10am or 11am the following morning, we located two other bombs.\"\nThis accounted for three of the nuclear bombs, but there was still one missing. By the next day, trucks filled with US troops had been sent from nearby bases, with the beach in Palomares becoming a base for some 700 US airmen and scientists urgently trying to contain any radioactive contamination and locate the fourth warhead.\n\"The first thing that you could see as the search really got underway in earnest was Air Force personnel linking up hand-by-hand and 40 or 50 people in a line. They would have designated search areas. There were some people with Geiger counters who started arriving, and so they started marking off the areas which were contaminated,\" said Capt Ramirez in 2011. When US personnel registered an area contaminated with radiation, they would scrape up the first three inches of topsoil and seal it in barrels to be shipped back to the US. Some 1,400 tonnes of irradiated soil ended up being sent to a storage facility in South Carolina.\nMore like this:\n•How a US general nearly started a nuclear war in 1950\n•The greatest sailing rescue ever made\n•How Russia launched a giant space mirror in 1993\nBoth the US and Spain, which at the time was under the brutal rule of Francisco Franco's military dictatorship, were keen to downplay the devastating accident. Franco was especially worried that radiation fears would hurt Spain's tourism industry, a major source of revenue for his regime. In an effort to reassure the local population and the wider world that there was no danger, the US Ambassador to Spain, Angier Biddle Duke, would end uptaking a swimin the sea off Palomares coast in front of the international press just weeks after the accident.\nBut despite hundreds of US personnel conducting an intensive and meticulous search of the surrounding area for a week, they still couldn't find the fourth bomb. Then Capt Ramirez spoke to a local fisherman who had helped rescue some of the surviving airmen who had splashed down in the sea. The fisherman kept apologising to Capt Ramirez for not being able to save one of the US flyers, whom he thought he had witnessed drifting down into the depths.\nCapt Ramirez realised that the fisherman could have actually seen the missing nuclear bomb. \"All the bodies had been accounted for, I knew that,\" he said. The search then quickly shifted to the Mediterranean Sea, with the US Navy mobilising a flotilla of more than 30 ships, including mine-sweepers and submersibles, to scour the seabed. The exploration of miles of ocean floor was both technically complicated and a very slow process, but after weeks of exhaustive searching, a newly developed deep-diving vessel, Alvin, finally located the missing bomb in an underwater trench.\nNearly four months after it was first lost, the warhead was finally made safe and back in US hands. The next day, despite the secrecy with which the US military had surrounding its nuclear arsenal, it took the unusual step of showing the bomb to the world's press. Ambassador Duke reasoned that unless people saw the bomb for themselves, they would never feel certain that it had actually been recovered.\nAlmost six decades later, the incident still casts a long shadow over the Almería region. TheUS clean-up operationmanaged to miss some areas of contamination, and the US and Spain agreed to fund yearly health-checks for Palomares residents. They also promised to monitor the soil, the water, the air and local crops. But there are still some 100 acres (40 hectares) of contaminated land in Palomares that remain fenced off. And despite Spain and the US signing amutual agreementin 2015 to clean up the area, neither has yet complied.\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to theIn History newsletter, whileThe Essential Listdelivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "Gates and Paul Allen launched computing giant Microsoft 50 years ago. In 1993, he talked to the BBC about the online innovations that would define the 21st Century.\nWhen the BBC first broadcast an interview with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates in June 1993, there were thought to be only130websites in total. The BBC's venerable science programmeHorizonwas investigating the new \"Electronic Frontier\", in an era where \"information is starting to redefine our world, its geography and its economy\". Gates told the programme: \"This is the information age, and the computer is the tool of the information age and software is what will determine how easily we can get at all of that information.\" Viewers could send off a cheque for £2 and receive a transcript of the programme in the post.\nThe computer industry had already grown faster than any in history, but the key to future profits was creating something portable and user-friendly. The programme asked: \"Do we need endless information, or do they just need to sell it to us?\" In a world where a list of almost every website could fit on two sides of a sheet of paper, the world wide web did not even get a mention. However, the ideas explored in the programme are often far ahead of their time.\nIn the early days of Microsoft, Bill Gates and Paul Allenset a goalof having a computer on every desk and in every home – all running Microsoft products, of course. They first met as children at a private school in Seattle, where they discovered a shared love of computers. Both went on to college but dropped out and created Microsoft, so-called because it provided microcomputer software.\nThe company'sbig breakcame in 1980 when Microsoft agreed to produce the operating system for the personal computer being developed by IBM, the world's leading computer company at the time. In a stroke of business genius, Microsoft was allowed to license the operating system to other manufacturers, spawning an industry of \"IBM-compatible\" personal computers which depended on its MS-DOS product. The money had begun toroll in– and to this day it has not yet stopped.\nWhile Gates was the serious-minded computer nerd, Allen was his offbeat big brother. Allen worked at Microsoft until 1983, stepping away from the frontline following a diagnosis of blood cancer. He recovered to become a successful venture capitalist and, having held onto his share of the company, he was a fixture on the world's rich lists untilhis deathin 2018 at the age of 65. He used his vast fortune to invest in his personal passions, owning both the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team and Seattle Seahawks NFL team, who won the Super Bowl in 2013.\nHis departure from Microsoft also meant that he had more time to perfect his guitar moves. Legendary music producer Quincy Jones even claimed in amagazine interviewthat Allen \"sings and plays just like Hendrix\". He said: \"I went on a trip on his yacht, and he had David Crosby, Joe Walsh, Sean Lennon... then on the last two days, Stevie Wonder came on with his band and made Paul come up and play with him – he's good, man.\" The design of Seattle'sMuseum of Pop Culture, which he founded, has been likened to a smashed guitar and was created by superstar architect Frank Gehry.\nAllen jumped ship from Microsoft before products such as Windows, Excel and Word ever made it into the world's homes and offices. By the early 1990s, Gates' vision for networked computers sent sales and profits soaring. However, the pair's early dream of putting a computer running Microsoft software in every home and business was only half complete. Word processing and spreadsheets were lucrative, but Microsoft's relentless drive to expand needed new worlds to explore. The next step was to bring multimedia into people's homes, turning the personal computer into a communication device. It was the world of leisure so beloved by Allen that Gates needed to tap into.\nGates acknowledged to the BBC in 1993 that \"the home will be a tougher frontier to conquer\". However, he was confident that Microsoft would succeed. \"If you take a time frame like 15 years or certainly 20 years, I have no doubt that the vision of a computer in every home, although it won't look like today's computer, will absolutely be achieved,\" he said.\nA year earlier, Bruce Springsteen had ahitgrumbling about having \"57 Channels (And Nothin' On)\". Undeterred by the Boss's cynicism, Microsoft'sNathan Myhrvoldtalked of a future where we would have up to 1,000 television channels. He said: \"That might sound like a nightmare, but I think it's a wonderful thing. Imagine what your favourite bookstore would be like if there were only five books.\" Describing a system resembling today's streaming services, he spoke of an \"online interactive guide, which uses computer technology to organise the channels, show them to you by topic, even learn of the material that you like to watch, and then present it to you in an online fashion right on the television\".\nMyhrvold was providing a tantalising glimpse of the future: a world at your fingertips where you could order anEn VogueCD or Prince tickets instantly. But what would this mean for personal privacy?\nThere was a warning in the 1993 programme from Denise Caruso, editor of the magazineDigital Media: \"The ease of sitting in front of your interactive TV five years hence and being able to order something by pushing your remote control means information about you is going through a network. That means that whoever is on the other end of that network knows what you're watching on television, can get your credit card number, can know lots of things about you that maybe you don't want them to know.\"\nCaruso raised issues echoed in the current debate aboutGenerative AImodels being trained by devouring copyrighted material. She said: \"By making information a commodity, you really change the nature of how people think about ideas and their work and what they do. I am a writer. My stock in trade is ideas, and when you try to draw lines around what information is and where did an idea come from and who had that idea originally and what napkin was it originally drawn on, when you start moving information into that realm, it starts to get very fuzzy about where one person's idea stops and another one starts.\"\nMore like this:\n•A 36-year-old Jeff Bezos talks about 'unprofitable' Amazon\n•The rocky 1960s origins of online dating\n•How Russia launched a giant space mirror in 1993\nShe said that while information was an incredible commodity, it had no value at all unless it could be protected. But how could you protect something that has no physical existence and could be copied or changed undetectably?\n\"The problem is that the solutions are as complex as the problems themselves. Do you want to lock up all the information? Absolutely not. We would have no scientific progress if scientists weren't able to freely exchange ideas and information. Do you just have a free-for-all and say all information is free? Well, you can't do that either because people do actually make their livings upon the fruit of their work, [which] is information, whether it's a book or it's a movie or it's music. I think technology is an incredible thing and it's very powerful, but it's powerful in both ways, and it's very important that we all understand that before we just embrace it.\"\nWhile the world wide web did not feature in the programme, it was many viewers' first introduction to the concept of electronic mail, or email. As Microsoft continued its voracious expansion, the company's human resources vice-president Mike Murray said that email \"creates an electronic village [which] allows us to transcend the borders of time or geographic barriers\". His words may seem grandiose now, but at the time it would have been a revolutionary idea that one could communicate instantly with someone or many people on the other side of the world without the need for an expensive international phone call.\nBy the end of 1993, the number of websites was estimated at623, having doubled every three months. By the end of 1994, the figure was 10,022. Microsoft was seen by some commentators as beingslowto acknowledge the possibilities and growth of the web, but in May 1995 Gates sent amemoto his senior staff titled \"The Internet Tidal Wave\", calling it \"the most important single development to come along since the IBM PC was introduced in 1981\". Three months later, Microsoft launched its web portal MSN alongside the release of Windows 95. Some versions had its brand-new Internet Explorer browser controversially bundled in. The future was again up for grabs, and Gates once again had some big thoughts on how he might conquer it.\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to theIn History newsletter, whileThe Essential Listdelivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "summary": "In March 1944, 76 officers broke out of a German prisoner-of-war camp. In 1977, a key member of the escape team talked to the BBC about the mission, and the Hollywood film it inspired.",
    "content": "On 24 March 1944, 76 allied officers broke out of a German prisoner-of-war camp, Stalag Luft III – a mission that was memorialised in a classic film, The Great Escape. In 1977, a key member of the escape team, Ley Kenyon, was interviewed on the BBC's Nationwide.\nOn a snowy moonless night in 1944, more than 200 allied officers attempted to break out of a German prisoner-of-war camp. It was the culmination of an incredibly ambitious plan that entailed more than a year of bribes, tunnelling, and the assembly-line production of equipment, uniforms and documents, all of which had to be painstakingly hidden from the camp's guards and spies.\nThe Great Escape, John Sturges's 1963filmabout the breakout, is a much-loved classic starring Steve McQueen, Richard Attenborough and James Garner. But it contains many inaccuracies. Jem Duducu, historian and presenter of the Condensed History podcast, described it in an interview inMetroas \"a strange mixture of fastidious creation and pure Hollywood fantasy\".\nThe story was first told by Paul Brickhill, one of the people who helped with the escape attempt, in his 1950 book, The Great Escape. He describes Ley Kenyon, who illustrated the book, as the mission's \"star counterfeiter\". Discussing the film with Dilys Morgan on the BBC's Nationwide in 1977, Kenyon said: \"It was good entertainment, but it certainly didn't express the real horror of being a prisoner of war, the horror being, of course, in one's personal feelings about being behind barbed wire – the boredom, the hunger. The hunger was pretty grim.\"\nOther ex-prisoners had a different view of the film. Charles Clarke, who was in the camp at the time, and had aided the plot as a look-out, told the BBC in a 2019radio interview: \"Even after all these years, I've always thought what a remarkable film it was.\"\nOne major change that the film made was to the personnel involved. While the events of The Great Escape are mostly rooted in fact, names were changed, and various people were combined into composite characters. At the time of the escape, no Americans remained in the compound, and the man who was said to be the model for McQueen's Virgil Hilts,William Ash, did not take part. The plan was spearheaded by Squadron LeaderRoger Bushell– who in the film was renamed Bartlett, and played by Attenborough. First captured in 1940 after being shot down, Bushell had an impressive record of escape attempts, once getting within 100 yards of neutral Switzerland.\nStalag Luft III was the Germans' attempt at an escape-proof camp, specifically for air force officers from the UK, Canada, Australia, Poland and other allied countries. It was built and run by the Luftwaffe as a secure place to hold people they believed were escape risks. What they had not done, however, was consider the ramifications of trapping so many escape experts in one place.\nThe camp was built over sandy soil that was difficult to tunnel through. This subsoil was also lighter and more yellow than the dark topsoil, making it obvious if any appeared on the ground of the camp. Huts were perched on brick legs to make tunnels down from them obvious. Brickhill describes in his book a \"double barbed wire fence nine-feet (2.75m) high\", just outside of which were 15-ft (4.5m) high \"goon-boxes\" every 100 yards or so, manned by sentries with searchlights and machine-guns. Additionally, microphones were buried in the ground around the wire so that they could pick up the sounds of any tunnelling.\nAs you might expect from a plan hatched by soldiers, the tunnel-digging enterprise was run with military efficiency. Bushell – also known as \"Big X\" – was in charge, and delegated certain parts of the organisation to other men. The planning began even before Stalag Luft III was built: Bushell and others knew it was coming, and volunteered to help build it. As a result, they were able to map it out and pick the best spots for a tunnel. Bushell had the idea that they would dig not one tunnel but three simultaneously. The logic was that if the Germans found one of them, they would never suspect that there were two others. They were to be referred to only by their codenames of Tom, Dick and Harry. Bushell threatened to court-martial anyone who even uttered the word \"tunnel\".\nThe aim was for 200 men to escape. This was a colossal undertaking. Each man needed a set of civilian clothes, forged passes, a compass, food, and more. Some passes needed photographs, so a camera was smuggled in by a guard who had been bribed. In the film, Donald Pleasence's character is in charge of the forgery. In reality, Kenyon was one of the forgers who had to counterfeit the thousands of pieces of paperwork necessary. In the Nationwide interview, he recalled how they made it happen: \"We made a printing press, for one thing, and each letter had to be hand-carved out of rubber which we got from the cobbler – rubber heels – or bits of wood cut with razor blades.\" Every document had to be perfect. They replicated passes and paperwork that they had either stolen from the guards or persuaded the guards to show them. \"Something like 7 or 8,000 pieces of paper were produced,\" he said.\nThe tunnels themselves were also miracles of engineering and ingenuity. An air pump was made with kit-bags and wood, and air was pumped through a line made of empty milk tins that had been sent by the Red Cross. A major issue was the dispersal of the soil that had been dug up, so bags that hung inside trousers were fashioned from long underwear and used to drop the sand around the camp, where it could be kicked into the ground.\nOf the three tunnels, Tom was discovered by the guards only a short while before it would have been completed. After a break, the decision was made to continue only with Harry. This tunnel was finished in the winter of 1943, and sealed up until conditions were suitable for a breakout. That time finally came on the night of 24 March 1944. Many things went wrong, but ultimately, of the 220 people chosen, 76 made it out before the 77th was spotted by a guard.\nA massive operation was mobilised to recapture the 76. They all knew that it was likely that they would be caught, but many viewed it as their duty to attempt escape. Another goal of the men was to make the Germans pull resources from their war effort to guard and search for them. According to Brickhill, five million Germans were involved in the search for the escaped prisoners. All but three of the 76 were recaptured. Two managed to make it to Sweden, and one to Spain.\nHitler wanted all 73 of the recaptured prisoners to be shot. Those around him managed to talk him out of it – after all, the British held German prisoners of war, and would not take kindly to the massacre of their officers. Still, Hitler declared that 50 of them should die.Ken Rees, who was in the tunnel when it was discovered, recounted hearing that those murdered were \"taken out in twos and threes, and shot\", in a BBC Witness History podcast in 2010.\nIn the fictionalised version, all of the men are driven to a field and shot by a machine-gun, but the reality involved more deceitful measures. Brickhill's book notes that the men were taken in small groups in the direction of the original camp and shot on the way. He wrote, \"The shootings will be explained by the fact that the recaptured officers were shot while trying to escape, or because they offered resistance, so that nothing can be proved later.\" All of the bodies were cremated, and, as Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden pointed out in a parliamentary speech given in June 1944, the only reason for this would have been to hide the manner of death.\nBushell was one of the men caught and murdered. He died aged 33. Details of his death came out in the investigation afterwards: along with his escape partner, he was shot in the back by Gestapo officers. His ashes were returned to the camp with the rest of the dead, but, according to his niece, the casket was broken when armies advanced on the camp, and so, more than 80 years later, he remains there.\nMore like this:\n•How music saved a cellist's life in Auschwitz\n•How WW2's D-Day began with a death-defying mission\n•How Oskar Schindler saved 1,200 Jewish People during World War Two\nTwo of the men who managed to avoid execution were Jimmy James and Sydney Dowse. In a 2012documentary, Dowse gave his perspective as a survivor. \"You rather wonder why the hell you yourself weren't shot. That's what Jimmy and I felt, anyway. Why we weren't shot. We could have been. It was just luck. And… pretty terrible.\"\nThe execution of 50 prisoners of war caused outrage in the UK. Eden said in hisspeech to Parliament: \"His Majesty's Government must, therefore, record their solemn protest against these cold-blooded acts of butchery. They will never cease in their efforts to collect the evidence to identify all those responsible. They are firmly resolved that these foul criminals shall be tracked down to the last man wherever they may take refuge. When the war is over they will be brought to exemplary justice.\" After the war, a huge effort was put into investigating the killings. As a result, the details emerged, and 13 Gestapo officers were hanged for their part in the executions.\nIt was only six years after the escape, in 1950, that Brickhill published his account of it, which was subsequently adapted into the famous film. When Charles Clarke was asked about his opinion of the Hollywood version of events, he said, \"Without the film, who would remember what a magnificent achievement it was?\"\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to theIn History newsletter, whileThe Essential Listdelivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "Stylish and experimental, Breathless heralded a new era of film-making when it was released 65 years ago. In 1964, its director told the BBC why he broke every rule he could.\nJean-Luc Godard was crystal clear about what he planned to do with his feature-length film debut, Breathless (À bout de souffle), which was released 65 years ago this month. He wanted to blow up the whole idea of what cinema was. In 1964, the director told the BBC's Olivier Todd: \"It was a film which took everything the cinema had done – girls, gangsters, cars – exploded all this and put an end once and for all to the old style.\"\nStylish and semi-improvised,Breathlessseemed revolutionary when it hit French screens on 16 March 1960. With its fragmented editing, offbeat dialogue and nonchalant approach to storytelling, it helped rewrite the language of modern cinema. As renowned US film criticRoger Ebertwrote: \"No debut film since Citizen Kane in 1942 has been as influential.\"\nOn its surface, Breathless's plot resembles that of a hard-boiled crime thriller. It tells the story of amoral, impulsive petty criminal Michel Poiccard (played by Jean-Paul Belmondo) and his doomed relationship with the enigmatic Patricia Franchini (Jean Seberg), an American journalism student living in Paris. The film's plot plays out as Michel tries to evade arrest after murdering a policeman: he struggles to collect the money necessary to fund his escape and to convince the ambivalent Patricia to flee with him to Italy. But its director was not so much concerned with its crime narrative as he was with shattering cinematic conventions.\nBorn in 1930 to wealthy Franco-Swiss parents,Godardhad spent the decade preceding Breathless's release immersed in cinema. At the beginning of the 1950s he had begun working as a film critic for the influential French magazine Cahiers du Cinéma. When he started, French cinema was dominated by studio-produced literary adaptations which valued polished storytelling over innovation. Godard, along with his fellow cinephiles at the magazine, railed against these films, arguing that they failed to capture any real emotion or show how people really behaved.\nAt the same time, US films that had been banned during the Nazi occupation were being shown in French cinemas. Following the Second World War, France had signed the Blum-Byrnes agreements which had opened up its markets to US products in return for eradicating its war debt. This led to a flood of US films that were enthusiastically embraced by these young French critics. They especially admired westerns and detective thrillers – genres they regarded as critically underappreciated. It was Italian-born French film critic Nino Frank who coined the term film noir or dark film. The Cahiers du Cinéma writers also revered film-makers who could stamp their own unique creative visions onto Hollywood productions, such as Orson Welles, Alfred Hitchcock and Howard Hawks. They regarded these directors as the true \"auteurs\" or authors of those films, rather than the studio which produced them or the stars who appeared in them.\nThroughout the 1950s, these critics would debate and discuss the shortcomings of French cinema while developing their own ideas of what it should be. Many of the writers Godard worked alongside at Cahiers du Cinéma, such as François Truffaut, Éric Rohmer and Claude Chabrol, would also end up becoming directors and leading proponents of the influential movement that would become known as La Nouvelle Vague (The New Wave).\nWith Breathless, Godard saw his chance to put the ideas he and his friends discussed into practice. He explained to the BBC in 1964 that he purposely set out to break rules he felt were holding back cinema. \"Conventions were exploded to make something with the remains, just as the debris is collected after an explosion. And when there is nothing useful left, we can start from scratch on fresh ground,\" he said.\nThe film's story was written by Truffaut, who based it loosely on a 1952 news article about a Paris criminal, Michel Portail. However, when Godard came to filming, he would pretty much abandon Truffaut's script. Instead, he got his actors to improvise scenes, or he would feed them lines from behind the camera while filming. This gave the dialogue a spontaneous and personal feel. But it meant that much of Breathless needed to be shot sequentially, so Belmondo and Seberg would know what had happened earlier in the story.\nDue to its limited budget, Godard's plan was to make the cheapest film possible. So instead of shooting in a studio where he would be able to control the lighting, the sound and the set, he took to the streets of Paris with his cinematographer, Raoul Coutard, who filmed on location using a lightweight handheld camera and relying on natural light. The camera, while portable and effective at filming in low-light conditions, was both noisy and unable to record synchronised sound. This meant that nearly all of the improvised lines of dialogue needed to be written down as Belmondo and Seberg ad-libbed, and then dubbed in post-production. This resulted in the later recorded dialogue often not matching the actors' lips, leading to debates that continue to this day about what the characters are actually saying.\nBecause much of Breathless's guerilla-style filming was done without permits or permission, random people going about their everyday lives in Paris's bustling streets and cafes were often captured in shot, lending an authenticity to its depiction of life in the city. Coutard had been a war photographer, and his reportage style of filming captured an immediacy and intimacy that made the film seem, at times, documentary-like. His camera moves restlessly around, capturing small everyday moments as the characters meet, talk and hang out. Sometimes the camera almost seems to be a participant in the action, sitting in the passenger seat of the car Michel has just stolen while he talks to it as if it were a friend. Breathless's lack of a conventional film crew added to its inventiveness. One of its most famous scenes, where Michel and Patricia are seen walking down the Champs-Élysées chatting as she advertises a newspaper, was achieved by Godard pulling Coutard along in a wheelchair while he filmed the actors walking towards him.\n\"The freedom of shooting on the Champs-Élysées, Jean Seberg walking down the curb with her unforgettable chanting, 'New York Herald Tribune'. It was like the invention of a mythology for me,\" the Italian director of Last Tango in Paris and The Last Emperor, Bernardo Bertolucci, told the BBC'sThe Film Programmein 2009.\nBut Godard wasn't trying to convince audiences that they were seeing unfiltered reality. He had been influenced by the German playwright Bertolt Brecht, who believed that a story could so absorb an audience that they became passive and unthinking. So, to keep viewers critically engaged, Brecht would remind them that they were watching a play and not real life.\nGodard embraced this idea, using a range of stylistic devices to make it impossible for viewers to forget that they were watching a film. Characters regularly break the fourth wall, addressing their dialogue directly to the audience. Often, they comment on their own situation, shaking the viewer's feeling of being an unseen spectator. And while a typical film's soundtrack subtly suggests the mood of a scene, in Breathless the music starts and stops suddenly, often disconnected from what is happening on screen at the time.\nBut it was Godard's rejection of the usual cinematic editing rules that would become the signature of the film. \"I was incredibly passionate about the style, the language of À bout de souffle,\" Bertolucci told the BBC. \"There were these jump cuts, for example. At school they were always telling you how to avoid jump cuts which were considered mistakes, and the movie was full of jump cuts.\"\nBreathless's use of jump cuts – abrupt transitions forward in time within the same scene – came about partly by accident. The finished film turned out to be much longer than intended, and Godard needed a way to cut it down to a manageable length. But instead of dropping whole scenes or sequences, the director chose to condense its running time by cutting out sections within takes. Often, he removes material from a continuous shot of movement or dialogue while making no attempt to match the edits, breaking the viewer's immersion in the film and giving it an energetic, skittish rhythm.\nThis jittery editing style lent Breathless a feeling of unpredictability, grabbing the audience's attention and forcing them to be aware of the film-making process. Godard also did this by referencing other films, while at the same time subverting the very conventions that make those films work. Otto Preminger's 1950 film noir thriller Whirlpool is playing when Patricia enters a cinema in an effort to lose the police trailing her. In another scene, when she looks through a rolled-up poster at Michel, the shot mimics a scene in the western Forty Guns (1957) which is seen through a gun barrel. The admired French director of gangster films, Jean-Pierre Melville, has a cameo appearance playing a fictional celebrity author, while Godard himself crops up as a bystander on the street who recognises the fugitive Michel from the newspaper articles.\nIn another homage to Godard's influences, the protagonist, Michel, dresses like his hero Humphrey Bogart and practises trying to emulate his onscreen mannerisms. At one point, while gazing at the poster for Bogart's last film, The Harder They Fall (1956), he whispers \"Bogey\" in admiration. But Michel's behaviour, unlike that of a Bogart hero, comes across as neither heroic nor courageous. He displays no conscience over his crimes or remorse over his actions. His girlfriend, Patricia, who goes on to betray him to the police, could be seen as a classic femme fatale character, but instead of being driven by passion, their relationship seems oddly detached and her motives remain opaque. The meaning in Breathless is never simply spelt out for its audience, and its freewheeling plot and morally ambiguous characters provide no easy answers. The film leaves it to the viewer to come to their own interpretations and judgements.\nMore like this:\n•How Easy Rider revolutionised Hollywood\n•The classic western that made Clint Eastwood a star\n•The cult erotic film that became a global hit\nWith its distinctive storytelling, imaginative camerawork andphotogenicyoung leads, who imbued it with an effortless sense of cool, Breathless was an immediate critical and commercial hit. It seemed to capture the mood of the times and people flocked to see it. \"They were in a sense ready for it,\" Professor James Williams told Kirsty Lang on the BBC'sLast Wordin 2022. \"I mean, people wanted something new and different.\" It would go on to win Godard the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 1960 Berlin International Film Festival.\nFor the aspiring directors who saw Breathless, its effect was electric. \"As a potential film-maker, it was like just being free, it was like being on a drug or something. It was just amazing,\" Get Carter's director Mike Hodges told the BBC'sThe Film Programmein 2006.\n\"It broke all the rules – and rules of film-making are quite frightening in many ways. You've got to get the angles right, and you have lines that you don't cross. This was in the classical tradition. So in a sense, cinema was very like the classical painters, whereas when you saw Godard's film, it was like the impressionists coming to life, but on the screen.\"\nBreathless's impact would be felt in many of the US films that followed its release, with Godard influencing the Hollywood studios that had so affected him. Breathless's characters' moral ambiguity and its abrupt shifts in tone could be seen inBonnie and Clyde(1967), its innovative camera angles and examination of relationship uncertainty were reflected inThe Graduate(1967), and its low-budget filming techniques and improvised dialogue were embraced inEasy Rider(1969).\nIn the 1970s, a slew of young directors inspired by the French New Wave, such as Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas, would put their own singular \"auteur\" visions of cinema on the screen. The directorQuentin Tarantino, who named his production company A Band Apart, after Godard's 1964 film Bande à part, has long acknowledged the effect the director had on him. He toldFilm Commentin a 1994 interview that \"Godard did to movies what Bob Dylan did to music: they both revolutionised their forms\".\nPart of Breathless'scontinuing influenceon film-makers is in persuading them that it is possible for the viewer to do just what Godard did. As Shaun of the Dead directorEdgar Wrightwrote afterGodard died in 2022: \"It was ironic that he himself revered the Hollywood studio film-making system, as perhaps no other director inspired as many people to just pick up a camera and start shooting.\"\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to theIn History newsletter, whileThe Essential Listdelivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "summary": "The story of Schindler's heroism became a novel and a film. But in 1982, author Thomas Keneally told the BBC that this was all thanks to a chance meeting with a luggage salesman.",
    "content": "The Nazis carried out the final \"liquidation\" of the Kraków Jewish ghetto on 13 March 1943, an act of violence that shocked a factory owner into becoming a saviour. These events were depicted in Thomas Keneally's novel Schindler's Ark and Steven Spielberg's film Schindler's List. But in 1982, Keneally told the BBC that Oskar Schindler's story was handed to him during a chance meeting with a luggage salesman.\nOskar Schindler was living in relative obscurity when his story was first featured on the BBC in 1964. Journalist Magnus Magnusson told viewers of the current affairs programme,Tonight: \"You may not have heard of him yet, but one day you will. Today, he lives in Germany; sick, unemployable and penniless. In fact, he lives on charity, but not the poor-box kind. The money that keeps him and his family alive comes from the 1,300 Jews whose lives he personally saved in the last war. Many of them are pledged to give one day's pay a year to the man they call the Scarlet Pimpernel of the concentration camps.\"\nSchindler was in the news that day because it had been announced that a Hollywood film called To the Last Hour was to be made about his life. It came about because a few years earlier, Holocaust survivor Poldek Pfefferberg had shared with MGM producer Martin Gosch the almost preposterous story of how he was among thousands saved by a Nazi war profiteer: a handsome, womanising drunk and wheeler-dealer from Czechoslovakia who had previously demonstrated few heroic qualities. While that particular film would get stuck permanently in development hell, in 1980 Pfefferberg had a chance meeting with an unsuspecting Australian writer that would change both their lives.\nThomas Keneally was killing time at the end of a Los Angeles promotional trip (\"I was being put up in unaccustomed grandeur by my publishers at a big hotel in Beverly Hills\") and window-shopping for a new briefcase before returning home to Sydney. He told the BBC'sDesert Island Discsin 1983 that the leather goods shop owner, \"being a good central European,\" came out to greet him and give him the hard sell.\nKeneally said: \"[Pfefferberg] did produce a very good briefcase, and while I was waiting for the charges to be cleared on my credit cards – they're very slow to clear Australian credit cards, I've noticed; it's the convict reputation – he began to talk to me about his wartime experience.\n\"He knew I was a writer, and he said, 'I've got a book for you. I was saved, but so was my wife, saved from Auschwitz by an extraordinary German, a big handsome Hitlerite dream of a man called Oskar Schindler. I have many Oskar Schindler documents. In the 1960s, a movie was nearly made about Oskar, and while we're waiting for your credit card to be cleared, have a look at this material.'\n\"He told his son to mind the shop, and he took me up to the bank on the corner, open on Saturdays. He talked them into running off photocopies of all this remarkable material, and at once I understood that here was a most astounding European character.\"\nOne of those documents was what would become known as Schindler's list. \"The list is life,\" Keneally would go on to write in his best-selling novel Schindler's Ark, and \"all around its cramped margins lies the gulf\".\nPfefferberg was born into a Jewish family in Kraków, where he had worked as a high school teacher and physical education professor until 1939, when Germany invaded Poland. He joined the Polish army and was wounded in battle. He told Keneally that when Poland fell to the Nazis and was partitioned between Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union, he had to make atough decision: \"We officers had to decide to go east or west. I decided not to go east, even though I was Jewish. If I had, I would have been shot with all the other poor sons of bitch in Katyn Forest.\" He was imprisoned in the Kraków ghetto, a segregated area established in 1941 by the Nazis. About 15,000 Jewish people were herded into an area that previously housed about 3,000 residents, and forced to live in dehumanising conditions.\nIt was also in Kraków that the Nazi Party member Oskar Schindler was exploiting wartime misery for money, taking over several confiscated Jewish-owned businesses including an enamelware factory. At first, most of Schindler's workers were non-Jewish Poles, but he later began to employ Jewish forced labourers from the ghetto. Pfefferberg became one of his employees. Meanwhile, the Nazis began rounding up groups of Jewish people at gunpoint and deporting them to nearby concentration camps. For those left behind, it was a time of terror.\nSchindler was forever changed in March 1943 by the brutality of the Nazis' final \"liquidation\" of the Kraków ghetto. Those deemed able to work were transported to the nearby Płaszów labour camp. Thousands more who were considered unfit for work were either murdered in the streets or sent to the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. To save his workers from the camps, Schindler turned to using his talent for corruption and deceit. He continued to persuade Nazi officials that his workers were vital to the German war effort, bribing high-ranking SS officers with money and alcohol. His factory also produced ammunition shells to ensure it was regarded as a vital resource, and he listed the names, birthdates and skills of his Jewish workers, emphasising their importance to the Nazi war machine.\nKeneallytold the BBC: \"What he virtually did was set up a benign concentration camp, not once but twice, and he kept on losing his people and getting them back by bribery, by bluff, by corrupting officials, and by exploiting the extraordinary SS bureaucracy that was involved in a preposterously systematic manner in the Holocaust.\"\nMore like this:\n•How music saved a cellist's life in Auschwitz\n•The man who saved 669 children from the Nazis\n•Anne Frank's father on his daughter's diary\nWhen the war ended, Schindler struggled with failed businesses and turned to alcohol. Those whom he had rescued would end up trying to rescue him, helping to support him financially. He died in 1974, aged 66. Survivors brought his remains to Israel, where he was buried in the Catholic Cemetery of Jerusalem. The inscription onhis gravereads: \"The unforgettable rescuer of 1,200 persecuted Jews.\"\nAmong those saved were Pfefferberg and his wife Mila. After the war, the couple made their way to the US, and ended up in Beverly Hills. Pfefferberg sometimes went by the nameLeopold Page. Keneally noted in his 2008 memoirSearching for Schindlerthat this was a name foisted on him upon arrival atEllis Islandin 1947. Hetold the BBCthat writing this companion volume had been on his to-do list since Pfefferberg's death in 2001. \"I felt that, as big a character as Schindler was, the man who had brought me to him was also an extraordinary character,\" he said.\nWhen Steven Spielberg won the best director Oscar for Schindler's List at the 1994 Academy Awards, inhis speechhe said: \"This never could have gotten started without a survivor called Poldek Pfefferberg… All of us owe him such a debt. He has carried the story of Oskar Schindler to all of us.\"\nThe film was based on Keneally's novel, Schindler's Ark, which won the UK's prestigiousBooker Prizein 1982. Some argued that it should not have been classified as fiction, as the author had applied imaginative literary techniques to real-life events in the manner ofworkssuch as Truman Capote's In Cold Blood and Tom Wolfe's The Right Stuff. Looking back in 2008, while discussing his Schindler memoir, Keneally told the BBC that the debate had been good for business. \"These days archbishops don't do writers the great benefit of banning them from the pulpit, but a literary controversy does nearly as well as the archbishops of the past did in promoting a book,\" he said.\nIn hisBooker Prizeacceptance speech, Keneally thanked Pfefferberg and other survivors who helped him tell the story. He said: \"I'm in the extraordinary position that's akin to that of a Hollywood producer when he humbly accepts his Oscar, and thanks so many people. Normally a writer doesn't have to thank so many people, but most of my characters are still alive. And I'd also like to remember the extraordinary character whom Oskar was.\"\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to theIn History newsletter, whileThe Essential Listdelivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "summary": "José Ignacio Bergoglio tells the BBC of the special relationship he had with his uncle who became Pope Francis.",
    "content": "To his family, Pope Francis was simply \"Jorge Mario\" - even during the 12 years that he was pontiff.\n\"When Jorge decided to accept the papacy, he understood his life as he knew it would change forever, and so did we,\" the Pope's nephew, José Ignacio Bergoglio, told BBC News Mundo.\n\"When we heard of his passing, it came with a certain comfort to the soul, because we knew our loved one was finally at peace, and once again, he was simply our Uncle Jorge.\"\nBefore he became the first Latin American to lead the Catholic Church, Pope Francis was Jorge Mario Bergoglio, born into a close-knit, middle-class household in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires.\nThe eldest of five siblings, he often described their bond as being \"as close as the fingers of one hand.\"\nAmong them, he shared a particularly special connection with his younger sister, María Elena – now the only surviving member of his immediate family.\nPope Francis also played a pivotal role in the life of his nephew, María Elena's son José Ignacio, who grew up without a father.\n\"I always say that my two uncles, Alberto and Jorge, became the father figures I so deeply missed as a child,\" José Ignacio said.\n\"Jorge knew how to be serious when needed, but he never lost his spontaneity or his sense of humour. He was a warm, approachable uncle, and I loved him deeply.\"\nJosé Ignacio vividly remembers the day his uncle was elected pope, a moment that stunned him, especially after he had dismissed all speculation that Jorge could ascend to the papacy.\n\"I had gone to a family friend's house for a meal, and we began watching the conclave. The moment the white smoke rose, I started to tremble. I became incredibly nervous,\" he said.\n\"Then, the protodeacon stepped out and announced, 'Habemus Papam.' I only heard 'Giorgio Mario.' I dropped to my knees in front of the television and started to cry.\"\nThe short journey to share the news with his mother, who lived just 15 blocks away, took much longer than usual. Everywhere he went, locals stopped him to offer their congratulations.\n\"At home, I hugged my mother, and we cried together for a while. Then cousins and friends started to arrive, and the phone was ringing off the hook.\"\nAmid the chaos, with local and international media camped outside their door, the phone rang again around 9pm. A distant voice on the other end simply said, 'Hello.'\n\"Who am I speaking to,\" I asked. \"It's Jorge, boludo,\" came the reply [using the rude slang Argentines use for \"idiot\", often affectionately].\n\"It was Pope Francis, swearing,\" José Ignacio recalled. \"I handed the phone to mum. As they spoke, I watched her tears dry. It was an incredibly moving moment.\"\nHundreds of thousands are expected to gather in St. Peter's Square on Saturday for Pope Francis's funeral, including world leaders, Catholic officials, and mourners from around the globe.\nHowever, José Ignacio said his family had no plans to travel to Rome for the service.\n\"We firmly believe our place is here,\" he explained, encouraging mourners to honour Pope Francis's memory by donating to charity, a gesture he believed would be a more meaningful tribute.\nJosé Ignacio had shared the news of his wife's pregnancy with the Pope during their last conversation, a moment that would remain etched in his memory forever.\n\"The joy and emotion he expressed were deeply meaningful to me,\" he said, adding that Pope Francis left him with a powerful message to live a life of solidarity, austerity, humility and commitment.\nHe also remembered a conversation from his teenage years when his uncle was a cardinal, recalling it as the best advice he ever received on how to make the world a better place.\n\"Change comes from within, through commitment,\" his uncle had told him.\n\"If you're unhappy with the police, become a policeman and change it from within. If you're dissatisfied with politics, get involved in politics. With commitment and conviction, we can create a better world,' he said.\n\"I think this is one of the most profound lessons I've learned from him.\""

    "summary": "The rap mogul denies sex trafficking and racketeering charges, plus dozens of other lawsuits alleging abuse.",
    "content": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, one of the most successful rappers and music moguls in the US, is due to go on trial on 5 May.\nThe charges against him include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution. If convicted, he could face life in prison.\nThe rapper also faces dozens of lawsuits from individuals who accuse him of using his power to drug, assault, rape, intimidate and silence people.\nMr Combs has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges and rejected the individual lawsuits as attempts \"for a quick payday\".\nMr Combs - who has also gone by the names Puffy, Puff Daddy, P Diddy, Love, and Brother Love - emerged into the hip-hop scene in the 1990s.\nHis early music career success included helping launch the careers of Mary J Blige and Christopher Wallace - aka Biggie Smalls, or the Notorious B.I.G.\nHis music label Bad Boy Records became one of the most important labels in rap and expanded to include Faith Evans, Ma$e, 112, Mariah Carey and Jennifer Lopez.\nMr Combs also had a prolific business career outside of music, including a deal with British drinks company Diageo to promote the French vodka brand, Cîroc.\nIn 2023, he released his fifth record The Love Album: Off The Grid and earned his first solo nomination at the Grammy awards. He also was named a Global Icon at the MTV Awards.\nIn the federal criminal case, Mr Combs is charged with racketeering conspiracy, two charges of sex trafficking and two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution.\nMany of the most severe allegations relate to the racketeering conspiracy charge.\nIt includes accusations of kidnapping, drugging, and coercing women into sexual activities, sometimes using firearms or threats of violence.\nIn a raid on his Los Angeles mansion, police found supplies that they said were intended for use in orgies known as “freak offs”, including drugs and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil.\nSeparately, Mr Combsfaces a number of lawsuits accusing him of rape and assault.\nTony Buzbee, a Texas lawyer handling some of these cases, said that more than 100 women and men from across the US have either filed lawsuits against the rap mogul or will do so.\nIn December 2023, a woman known in court papers as Jane Doe alleged that she was \"gang raped\" by Mr Combs and others in 2003, when she was 17. She said she was given \"copious amounts of drugs and alcohol\" before the attack.\nMr Combs' legal team dismissed the flurry of lawsuits as \"clear attempts to garner publicity.\"\nHis current legal issues began when he was sued by his ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura, also known as Cassie, in late 2023.  She accused him of violently abusing and raping her.\nThat lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount a day after it was filed, with Mr Combs maintaining his innocence.\nSince then, dozens of people have filed lawsuits accusing Mr Combs of sexual assault, with accusations dating back to 1991. He denies all claims.\nHis controversial history with Ms Ventura resurfaced in 2024, whenCCTV footage leaked by CNN showed Mr Combs kicking his former girlfriendas she lay on a hotel hallway floor in 2016.\nHe apologised for his behaviour, saying: \"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now.\"\nMr Combs has consistently denied the allegations made against him in the civil lawsuits, describing them as \"sickening\" and suggesting they were made by \"individuals looking for a quick payday\".\nIn a statement to the BBC about the federal criminal charges, his lawyer said: \"Mr Combs and his legal team have full confidence in the facts and the integrity of the judicial process.\n\"In court, the truth will prevail: that Mr Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor.\"\nDiddy's lawyers later filed a motion to dismiss an aspect of the federal indictment in which he is accused of transportation to engage in prostitution. His team argued he was being unfairly targeted due to his race.\nMr Combs has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, since his arrest on 16 September 2024.\nHis lawyers have argued for his release, citing the jail’s “horrific” conditions.\nCritics describe the prison as overcrowded and understaffed, with a culture of violence.\nA New York federal judge denied the bail request, describing Mr Combs as a “serious flight risk”.\nProsecutors have alleged thatMr Combs has been breaking prison rulesby contacting potential witnesses.\nThey accuse him of \"relentless efforts\" to \"corruptly influence witness testimony\".\nThetrial is scheduled to begin on 5 May.\nThe first days of the trial will be for jury selection, with the trial starting in earnest after the panel is selected.\nProsecutor Emily Johnson told the judge that the government will need three weeks to present its case.\nDefence lawyer Marc Agnifilo said the rapper's team will need a week for theirs.\nMr Combs' trial - scheduled to take place at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan courthouse in New York City - is expected to be public.\nAll of Mr Combs' court proceedings thus far have been open to the media and the public, but not livestreamed.\nMost federal courts do not allow cameras or electronics in the courtroom.\nMr Combs faces up to life in prison if convicted on the racketeering charge.\nHe faces another statutory minimum sentence of 15 years if he is found guilty of sex trafficking.\nTransportation for purposes of prostitution carries a maximum sentence of 10 years."

It raises the question: why do we watch such brutality?\nGood theatre has the power to really move us – a statement that's usually taken metaphorically, rather than literally. Yet when it comes to Shakespeare's bloodiest play, Titus Andronicus, its impact can be so visceral it causes audience members to faint. I should know: while reviewing a production atShakespeare's Globein London, back in 2014, its disturbingly violent scenes caused me to start to feel light-headed, even while safely sat down in my seat. Unfortunately, it was a bench with no back: before the end of the first half, I had fainted away completely, falling backwards and waking up in a stranger's lap.\nWarning: this article contains some graphic descriptions of violence\nAnd I was far from the only person to have such a full-bodied response to Lucy Bailey's production of this gory revenge tragedy: the press went wild forstories of \"droppers\", with more than 100 people fainting during the run – testament to the immense power of Shakespeare's writing, and the skill of performers, as well as to the props department's handling of litres of fake blood.\nOne of the Bard's earliest plays, written in 1591-2, and almost certainly his first tragedy, Titus Andronicus is a story of violent vengeance: Titus, a general of Rome, returns from wars against the Goths with their queen, Tamora, and her sons held as captives. When her eldest son is sacrificed by Titus, Tamora swears revenge – setting in motion a series of increasingly brutal acts that ends  with an infamous scene involving the baking of pies... Boasting 14 deaths, it is the most violent of all Shakespeare's plays – and now it's back on stage, with a new production opening at the UK's Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon.\nThe play's unavoidable ultra-violence has meant that, for much of the performance history of Shakespeare – whose birthday is today – Titus Andronicus was considered a bit of an embarrassment, a bloody stain on his reputation: too gruesome, too over-the-top, to be considered in the same category of greatness as, say, Hamlet or Othello. Then there's its sometimes queasy tone: the excesses can tip Titus into a gleefully macabre, manic comedy (an aspect also embraced in Bailey's gore-fest). Let's just say, the Victorians were not fans.\nBut the play's reputation began to revive in the second half of the 20th Century. At the Royal Shakespeare Company alone, there have been several seminal productions in the past 70 years, starring Laurence Olivier (1955), Patrick Stewart (1981), Brian Cox (1987) and David Bradley (2003), while Anthony Hopkins playing Titus on screen in Julie Taymor's influential, blackly funny film version in 1999 also surely helped boost the play's standing. Some of these productions leaned heavily on the horror, too: there were fainters and walk-outs in Deborah Warner's unflinching 1987 production, which Coxonce claimedwas the most interesting play he'd done and the best stage performance he'd ever given. But he also pointed to the odd humour of the play, calling it \"a young man's play… full of energy, joie de vivre and laughter that often strikes people as ludicrous\".\nTitus is notalwaysstaged with grisly literalness: in the Olivier-starring production by Peter Brook, the mutilation of Titus's daughter Lavinia was famously suggested with stylised red streamers – an aestheticised approach also used in the Japanese Ninagawa Company's production in the 2000s. More recently, Jude Christian's all-female 2023 production in London's candle-lit Sam Wanamaker Playhouse enacted the violence on candles themselves, with cast members stabbing, snapping or snuffing them.\nIn the latest production of Titus Andronicus, however, there will be blood. Buckets of it. \"We are doing gallons of blood. We've made a sort of wet room [on stage], it's got a drainage system and an abattoir hook…\" says Max Webster, the play's director, over a video call from Stratford-upon-Avon. He's had to figure out how to stage no fewer than 27 different acts of onstage violence, from punches through to limbs being lopped off and tongues being cut out. And the only limit on the amount of gore sloshing around is the practical question of how to clean it up between scenes. \"It's an unbelievably boring thing about how many crew members and squeegees it takes,\" laughs Webster. \"In one sentence, you're thinking 'what is the meaning of tragedy in relation to human nature?' – and then very quickly you get into 'how many mops can the crew hold?'.\"\nWebster, whose acclaimed productions include an adaptation of Booker Prize winner Life of Pi and a recent David Tennant-starringMacbeth, wanted to direct Titus Andronicus for one simple reason: Simon Russell Beale, one of Britain's greatest Shakespearean actors, asked him to. Titus was a part that Russell Beale fancied a crack at, and the RSC was happy to oblige. This version is updated – set in a crisp, besuited modern world riven by conflict, although where exactly is kept deliberately vague.\n\"It's trying to be open – we're not setting it in Kosovo or Gaza or Sudan,\" says Webster, adding swiftly \"And we're not going to try to produce the US army onstage or something – it's trying to make sense of Rome as a 'superpower of empire' rather than as 'the United States of America'.\" Still, he sees Titus as freshly, troublingly relevant, in light of shocking events such as the 7 October Hamas attacks, the war in Gaza, and the sudden invasion of Russian troops into Ukraine, the story's extreme violence doesn't seem so unimaginable.\nIn this production, the violence is certainly no laughing matter. In rehearsals, they have been playing it entirely seriously, and eschewing the blackly cartoonish or stylishly Tarantino-esque approach to the violence that some directors explore. This has risks: Webster fully expects that, when the show is in front of an audience, there may be some nervous laughter; it'll be their job in previews to figure out where these laughs form a necessary \"pressure release valve\", and where they're really just a sign to make the show even more harrowing.\nFor Webster, it isn't possible to laugh at the brutality of Titus Andronicus in 2025 – it's too real. He sees the play as \"a howl of pain\"; watching it becomes an act of witness, an attempt to face up to atrocities taking place right now – something that he acknowledges could be hard for an audience. \"I can walk down the Avon [river], and know my family is safe and it doesn't feel like the world is burning. But you look at other parts of the world… these horrors, that maybe feel historical to us, are actually happening.\"\nBut Titus Andronicus isn't a documentary; it's an old play, that people choose to stage and choose to pay to go to see. So why, when we could just watch the news, do we opt to watch such harrowing content as art, as entertainment? It's a question that partly motivated Russell Beale to do Titus,he told The Guardianlast week: \"I don't understand the violence. I don't understand why as an audience we feel excited, stimulated, challenged by it; it's so relentless.\"\nIt may have been shunned in later centuries, but Titus Andronicus's original audiences loved it – and many other forms of graphically horrible entertainment, from bear baiting to public hangings. Titus was a hit in Elizabethan England, and in writing it Shakespeare may, in fact, have been playing to the crowd: it resembles the super-violent revenge tragedies that were popular at the time, rarely-staged works such as Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy and Thomas Middleton's The Revenger's Tragedy. Such plays were, themselves, drawing inspiration from the incredibly bloody and outrageous tragedies written by Seneca in the First Century AD – including Thyestes, a source of direct inspiration for Shakespeare, where the title character is fed a pie made of the flesh of his own children. And obviously, Ancient Greek tragedies – even if they keep acts of violence off-stage – are a rich and enduring source of creative murders of family members and cycles of bloody revenge.\nSuch tragedies, Webster points out, had their origins in ritual performances of sacrifice. \"I guess theatre came out of killing goats in Ancient Greece… there's always been some relationship between theatre and violence and the sacred stuff.\"\nMore like this:\n•Edward II: Did a gay love affair spark a royal crisis?\n•The Shakespeare words you don't know you know\n•The Shakespeare tragedy that speaks to us now\nIt does seem that watching the very worst things imaginable unfolding has an irresistible appeal – not only do we still return to Greek or Shakespearean tragedies, but we've also turned death and violence into major sources of entertainment, apparently appropriate for daily consumption. Horror films, true crime podcasts, police procedurals, first-person shooter video games… depictions of very, very bad things happening to bodies are pervasive across all art forms, all the time. You might even say we're addicted to the adrenaline shot we get from such emotionally-wringing, extreme forms of entertainment:research showsthat the blood-pumping, heart-racing high we get from fear is close to the pleasurable bodily experience of excitement.\nFrom the high body count of fantasy shows likeGame of ThronesandHouse of the Dragonto the dystopian chills ofSquid Gameto the seemingly endless appetite for the torture porn movies of the Saw franchise, much of our creative output would make Seneca smack his lips in approval. But beyond the potential physical thrills, why are we so drawn to watching such violent content?\nWhen I ask Webster, he's as unsure as Russell Beale. \"The truth is, I don't know. But thereisa lust to watch violence on-stage – it is a basic human urge.\" He wonders if it forms a safe outlet for our innate human darkness. And a common theory as to why we enjoy the terrors of a horror movie or the bleakness of a dystopian novel is just this: that such fictional outings are a secure way for us to rehearse terrible acts – without ever having to experience those in real life. \"Maybe it is so we don't have to do [violence] in our lives?\" Webster ponders. \"We all have these weird, dark, turbulent fantasies that we don't talk about because they're not socially acceptable… so maybe seeing it on-stage is an escape, or a relief?\"\nThe academics Haiyang Yang and Kuangjie Zhang confirm Webster's theory, sharing research in theHarvard Business Reviewthat found that horror entertainment \"may help us (safely) satisfy our curiosity about the dark side of human psyche… As an inherently curious species, many of us are fascinated by what our own kind is capable of. Observing storylines in which actors must confront the worst parts of themselves serves as a pseudo character study of the darkest parts of the human condition.\"\nIf I'm honest, the news that there's so much blood in Webster's Titus Andronicus that they need a drain on stage has got me nervous of watching the show, rather than gleefully ready to excise my inner demons. Is he worried that this Titus might be so powerful – so bloody, and so upsetting – that people will faint? He is not. \"It's important you provide a content warning, and then people can make an informed decision about if they want to see it,\" says Webster. \"If people faint, they faint.\"\nTitus Andronicusis at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until 17 June\nHolly Williams novelThe Start of Somethingis out in paperback now\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "As museums around the world celebrate the 250th birthday of JMW Turner, it's time to reappraise his beloved and celebrated painting, The Fighting Temeraire.\nJMW Turner's The Fighting Temeraire became a national celebrity when it was first unveiled in 1839, and its fame has endured to the present day. It was once votedBritain's favourite paintingand currently features on£20 banknotes. But the widely accepted interpretation of this iconic painting's message might, in fact, contradict Turner's true intentions.\nThe \"Temeraire\" of the title refers to a 98-gun warship of the British Navy, which is depicted in the painting's background. It was a hero in Britain's defence against France during the Napoleonic Wars, but it caught the nation's attention in 1838 when it was dismantled and its parts sold off. Turner's painting depicts this once-mighty gladiator of the seas being towed down a burnished River Thames by a much more recently invented steam-powered tugboat.\nA brief segment in the 2012 James Bond filmSkyfallcaptures a popular view about the painting. In the scene, Bond (Daniel Craig) meets Q (Ben Whishaw), his new head of research and development, in London's National Gallery, and they sit in front of The Fighting Temeraire. \"It always makes me feel a little melancholy\", says the young, tech-savvy Q, in a pointed jibe to 007, an old-school field agent. \"A grand old warship being ignominiously hauled away for scrap.\"\nThis echoes the widely held belief that the painting evokes a sense of nostalgia and faded national glory. According to this view, the ghostly Temeraire is the painting's heroine, and the tugboat its villain. In the 19th Century, the English writer William Makepeace Thackeray referred to the smaller vessel as \"a little, spiteful, diabolical steamer\" and the American novelist Herman Melville called it \"a pygmy steam-tug\" by comparison to the \"Titan Temeraire\".\nYou can see why Turner's original audience may have sympathised with the humbled HMS Temeraire and been saddened by her fate. Back in 1804, she had played a critical role in blockading French ports and defending the British coast. But her finest moment came on the afternoon of 21 October 1805, in the Atlantic Ocean, just off the coast of south-west Spain.\nAt this pivotal hour, the Battle of Trafalgar, a deadly sea battle between the British Royal Navy and the combined fleets of Spain and France, was at its climax. Admiral Lord Nelson's flagship HMS Victory had led the attack but was being pummelled by the French vessel Redoubtable. Then, out of the cannon smoke, surged HMS Temeraire, followed by a war-hungry flotilla of British vessels. The Temeraire blasted the Redoubtable with her guns and endured a hailstorm of cannon volleys in return – an onslaught that lacerated the ship and spattered her decks with blood. But like a stalwart prize-fighter, the Temeraire weathered the bout. She valiantly protected her flagship and played a vital part in the British navy's ultimate victory in the Battle of Trafalgar.\nTurner was 64 when he painted The Fighting Temeraire. He was born in 1775 in a down-at-heel area of London near Covent Garden but managed to enrol at the prestigious Royal Academy of Arts aged 14. He became an Academician at the precocious age of 24, and a Professor of Perspective when he was just 32. But although he rubbed shoulders with the great and the good, he refused to soften his Cockney accent or refine his manners. He was also fiercely entrepreneurial – he opened his own private gallery, sought wealthy patrons, and was always on the lookout for captivating and lucrative new artistic projects that might have widespread appeal. On one level, The Fighting Temeraire achieves his desire for broad popularity by harnessing people's sense of national pride.\nBut there's an even more important message to learn from the painting than its patriotism and sentimentality. It concerns that much maligned tugboat: the true focal point of the painting.\nSteam power was the new mechanical wonder of Turner's age, and his attitude to this recent technology was much more complicated than Thackeray, Melville or Q recognised. In other Turner artworks, like Snow Storm – Steam-Boat (1842) and Rain, Steam and Speed (1844), you can see his fascination with modern machinery and its transformative influence on individual experience, the environment, and society as a whole. This is in stark contrast with Turner's great rival John Constable, whose parents were from the elite, and whose paintings tended to overlooksome of the most seismic changesthat were reshaping the British Isles at the time.\nIn Constable's iconic 1821 painting The Hay Wain, an archaic cart rolls gently away from the viewer into a bucolic English landscape. Turner's The Fighting Temeraire gives us the exact opposite, putting the spectator on a collision course with the unstoppable force of industry.\nThis reflected contemporary reality. At the time The Fighting Temeraire was painted, the Royal Navy was increasingly using steamboats for towing bigger vessels. Moves were already afoot to replace its sail-powered fleet with new steam frigates. But the demise of the Temeraire didn't reflect a routine upgrade in armaments. This was a one-of-a-kind revolution in seafaring. Sailors around the world had relied on wind-and-sail or oar-propulsion for thousands of years. Now, steam engines could allow seafarers to overcome the vagaries of gusts, shallows and tidal patterns – to supersede nature itself. The future was steam-powered, but how this was going to affect the future of transport, trade and naval combat was still anybody's guess in the 1830s. What Turner did know was that as far back asHomer's Odyssey, sailing functioned as a profound symbol of the life journey in art and literature. And so, by hitching the old and the new so unforgettably in his painting, he shows us a compelling metamorphosis – the beginning of a new, post-industrial lifecycle in human history.\nTurner was awake to the responsibility of artists in times of irreversible historical change. For him, the age-old skill of depicting wooden sailing ships, their rigging, sails and ornately carved figureheads was becoming obsolete. The challenge for every artist (and every member of society) in the modern age, he realised, was to discover beauty and significance in newness, and in artefacts that had not previously been depicted in art, like iron funnels, pistons, valves, and paddle wheels. In The Fighting Temeraire, his rise to this challenge is captured in a very memorable and uncompromising symbol.\nMore like this:\n•The forgotten Monet finally getting her moment\n•The schmaltzy paintings that divided the US\n•The surprising story of Van Gogh's guardian angel\nTurner even adapted his painting technique to express the technological and social transformations in the world around him. He used newly invented paint hues like Lemon Yellow and Scarlet Lake in The Fighting Temeraire. Pigment analysis of the painting also indicates that he raided from his kitchen for substances to add his paint to achieve desired effects, like tallow, cooking fat or even salad oil.\nHis interest in new technology, and his search for innovative techniques with which to represent them, had a direct impact on the next generation of avant-garde painters. Claude Monet and Camille Pissarro were both wowed by Turner's art. An engraving of Turner's Rain, Steam and Speed (which depicts a train hurtling over Maidenhead bridge) was even displayed atthe first Impressionist Exhibition in Paris in 1874– a pivotal event in the history of modern art.\nIn 2025 various exhibitions will celebrate the 250th anniversary of Turner's birth, from Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool (Turner: Always Contemporary), to Turner's House in Twickenham (Turner's Kingdom: Beauty, Birds and Beasts), and from the Yale Centre for British Art, Connecticut (JMW Turner: Romance and Reality) to Tate Britain (Turner and Constable). But to fully appreciate this extraordinary artist, it's important to grasp the true meaning of his masterpiece, The Fighting Temeraire.\nFrequently it's been accepted as a melancholy image, a forlorn lament for past glories and a lost way of life. But this misses its essential point. The Fighting Temeraire is really about transformation and the inevitability of change rather than nostalgia. The most important lessons to learn from The Fighting Temeraire are about Turner's attitude and outlook. It embodies his refusal to be daunted by newness or enslaved by traditional artistic values. His quest to find the beauty and grandeur of modern experience, and leave the past behind, is magnificently on display in The Fighting Temeraire. And these qualities are truly his lasting legacy to modern art.\nThe 250th anniversary of JMW Turner's birth is on 23 April 2025.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "section": "arts",
    "summary": "Two homeowners had very different experiences when the elusive artist chose their walls for his work.",
    "content": "Sam was lying in bed one morning when her tenant in a house she owned in Margate sent her a photo of a piece of graffiti that had appeared on the wall outside.\nAstonishingly, it looked like a Banksy. It would turn out to be perhaps the graffiti artist's most interesting new artwork of recent years, Valentine's Day Mascara (pictured above), which was revealed in Margate on Valentine's Day, 2023.\nBamboozled, Sam googled: what do you do when you wake up with a Banksy on your wall?\n\"What did Google say about that?\" I asked her.\n\"Nothing! And I was like, I need to contact the council, I need to find an art gallery who can advise me.\"\nSam called Julian Usher at Red Eight Gallery. Julian's team, conscious that new Banksys are under immediate threat from street cleaners, the weather, rival graffiti artists and other art dealers, promised he'd be in Margate within the hour: \"We knew we had to get the piece covered,\" say Julian.\nAnd there was another reason Julian got to Margate double-quick: if Banksy chooses your wall for one of his drawings, you could be seriously in the money.\nFor the second season of myBBC Radio 4 podcast The Banksy Story, which is called When Banksy Comes To Town, I've been following the very different fates of two sets of homeowners who wake up one day to find a Banksy on their wall. The season shows just how important his graffiti becomes for a local community – and why people disagree so vehemently about what should happen after it's discovered.\nSam became the custodian of Valentine's Day Mascara, which speaks to the theme of domestic violence, incidents of which usually spike each Valentine's Day. It's a complicated bit of work. A peppy 50s housewife with a black eye has bludgeoned her partner. A real pan with flecks of red is at her feet, and his painted legs are upended into the real fridge-freezer that Banksy left by the wall. A broken plastic chair testifies to the fight they have had.\nLater on the day it appeared, refuse collectors arrived to spirit away the fridge-freezer. This precipitated a free-for-all, with the public helping themselves to the remnants. It was mayhem.\nA media scrum, a wrong-footed local council, millions of global onlookers. Exactly, one suspects, what Banksy wanted.\nAnd this time, just for laughs, he left behind oil painter Peter Brown, commissioned to capture the scenes he would miss. I spoke to Pete \"The Street\" Brown for my series. \"The whole reason I was employed was because Banksy was questioning what was the art about,\" Pete explained. \"Is it about the graffiti? Or is it about the reaction afterwards, and what happens to it?\"\nAs luck would have it, Pete was captured on video just as Banksy's team were putting the finishing touches to Valentine's Day Mascara – a video that The Banksy Story managed to obtain. In it we can see that one of Banksy's team let a local kid play with their drone.\n\"They're in the process of putting a large piece on a wall and yet they're taking the time to teach a kid how to fly a drone,\" says Steph Warren, who used to work with Banksy and who appeared in my first series - about the artist's rise and rise. \"Very sweet!\"\nAlongside Sam, I've been following the story of Gert and Gary. They, like Sam, did not want me to use their last name. A 30ft-high seagull appeared one morning on the wall of their buy-to-let in Lowestoft in Suffolk. The bird needed to be massive for Banksy's ambitious visual gag to work. The artist had shoved large yellow insulation strips into a skip that now looked like a fast-food container that the seagull divebombed to steal chips.\nBanksy had chosen his wall well. Visitors arriving by train were treated to this witty meditation on the scourge of Britain's seaside towns, equal parts warning and celebration. The Lowestoft Seagull was part of Banksy's Great British Staycation, his post-Covid lockdown campaign to cheer us all up at the prospect of a summer holiday spent in the UK.\nBut Gert was not cheered-up at all. \"It's not a seagull, it's an albatross!\" she quipped when I went to interview her.\n\"How did you know it was a Banksy?\" I asked.\n\"There was scaffolding erected on the side of the house. I tried to find out if it was a particular scaffolding firm, but there was no phone number,\" Gert replied. \"On the Monday morning the letting agency informed me that I could possibly have a Banksy. By then the scaffolding had gone and this seagull appeared.\"\nThis fits with what we know of Banksy's modus operandi. He claims hiding in plain sight is the best way to remain invisible. \"If questioned about your legitimacy,\" he wrote in his book Wall & Piece, \"simply complain about the hourly rate.\"\nIt's a good gag. But how fun is it for the folk on the other end of his spray can?\nI found that with good hustling skills a Banksied homeowner might see their bank balance expanded, but it's not an easy process.\nAs Gert explains, exasperated, \"Lowestoft people commented that it belongs to Lowestoft… But nobody's turned up to say, 'we'll help you protect it'. It doesn't belong to the person filming it, or the person taking pictures with their children. The problem is mine!\"\nGert had to contend with people putting their children into the skip for photo opportunities, the council trying to charge her for Perspex screens, and the threat of a Preservation Order which might have cost her £40,000 a year.\nAnd the two stories I've been following have ended up having entirely different outcomes.\nBoth artworks have been taken off the houses they were painted on – a complex, expensive operation that uses specialist equipment – so they can be sold. But while the Banksy in Margate is now on the verge of selling for well over £1m, with a sizeable chunk set to go to a domestic violence charity, and with the piece remaining in the town for the foreseeable future, the Banksy up the coast in Lowestoft languishes in a climate-controlled warehouse, costing its owners £3,000 per month.\nIt has cost Gert and her partner Gary around £450,000 so far to preserve the piece and although there are buyers sniffing around, nobody has bought it yet. Speaking about the situation, Gary told me: \"I'm so angry at what's going on.\"\nNot everyone approves of people trying to sell Banksy's street art.\nSteph Warren – who starred in the first series of The Banksy Story as the only person ever to work for Banksy without signing his non-disclosure agreement – suggests that worried homeowners should simply \"get busy with five litres of white emulsion and paint it out\".\nOwner of street-art gallery Stelladore in St Leonards, Warren is a purist, who feels that art made for the street should remain there, no matter its value. \"With Banksy, where he puts the art is fundamental,\" she says. \"Remove the work from the precise place on the streets that he put it, and the work instantly loses its power. Context is everything.\"\nBut Banksy has elevated graffiti into a new art form, now monetised – street art. Banksy's signed prints can sell for six-figure sums. Graffiti, or street art, has not just come of age, it is now an asset class. Given this, how can any homeowner feel okay about scrubbing away a Banksy without feeling as if they have smashed a Ming vase?\nOne thing I know for sure: if you wake up with a Banksy on your wall, you'll have to make a series of clever decisions to come out of it unscathed. As Sam says, after two years of dealing with the Banksy circus, \"going back to normal life now is going to be terribly boring\"."

    "content": "Disney's stage version of their hit film is an unmatched global phenomenon. Twenty-seven years on from its premiere, its director discusses why it was a big risk that paid off 10 billion-fold.\nThe Lion King musical is a beast of a show – captivating US audiences since 1997, it is the highest-grossing production of all time, in theatreorin film, taking over $10 billion (£7.68 billion) worldwide. It's currently celebrating 25 years in the West End, hits 27 years on Broadway next month, and has been staged all around the world – from South Africa to South Korea, Australia to the United Arab Emirates – visiting every continent except Antarctica. \"The penguins don't need us,\" quips Julie Taymor, the theatre, film and opera director and designer whose unique vision helped the musical spring into life on stage – proving that theatrical versions of Disney movies could not only be hugely profitable, but could do so while being artistically inventive in their own right.\nWarning: This article contains language that some may find offensive\nBut when Disney initially approached her about directing a live version of their adored 1994 cartoon film, Taymor didn't know what to say: she hadn't actually seen The Lion King. \"I thought, well, why not, let's go look at the movie,\" the still youthful-looking 71-year-old recalls, speaking to me via Zoom from the US. \"And I was really taken; I loved it.\" The challenge of adapting an epic, wide-screen story excited her: how, she recalls wondering, would you put hundreds of animals on stage? How could you create a stampede of wildebeest live in front of an audience?\nThe answer was by embracing a distinctly theatrical approach: The Lion King uses masks and puppetry to put the animals of the African savannah onstage, and to tell the coming-of-age story of Simba the lion, from cub to king. Taymor designed all the costumes and masks, and the breakthrough moment was deciding to let the audience see the mechanics of how each character is made – to invite them to suspend their disbelief, and to use their imagination in helping create that whole world onstage.\n\"I went through every animal: okay, we've got a giraffe, I'll put the neck on top of the head of the dancer, but you're going to see the dancer's face, you're going to see where the stilts are wrapped to the dancer's hands…\" remembers Taymor gleefully. \"There is no attempt to hide the human being behind the masks or inside the puppet,\" she says, a technique she dubbed the \"double event\", allowing performers to be both animal and human simultaneously.\nSo you can see Simba's emotion on the actor's face, while a mask on top of his head reminds the audience that this is, in fact, a lion; Timon the meerkat is a puppet, drawing on the Japanese Bunraku puppetry tradition where you can fully see the person behind him, controlling his movements. Trays of grasses on performers' heads evoke swaying grasslands, while whole flocks of gazelles are created by a chorus wearing puppets on their heads and arms at the same time.\n\"I wanted to do what theatre does best,” recalls Taymor. \"Film hides the strings: we know it's fake, but we're pretending that it's really there – that the Titanic is really on the ocean, that it's really sinking. Whereas in the theatre, we will enjoy seeing a little puppet of a boat, and a big ocean of silk… this is the power of theatre. The audience is not played down to – they're brought into the game.\"\nToday, it's hard to imagine The Lion King being done any other way – but it wasn't all smooth sailing. And even getting the call from Disney was a surprise to start: while Taymor had already made a name for herself within theatrical circles – her musical fable about a jaguar cub who transforms into a boy in the Uruguay jungle, Juan Darién, had netted five Tony nominations in 1996. But aside from that big cat connection, her work's distinctly international flavour and its heavy use of masks and puppetry inspired by Indonesian and Japanese traditions didn't necessarily scream family-friendly commercial juggernaut. Nonetheless, Thomas Schumacher, the new head of Disney Theatricals, had a hunch Taymor's highly visual style of theatre could be just the thing to bring The Lion King to the stage.\nIt wasn't the first live Disney musical – that was Beauty and the Beast, also a commercial success, running on Broadway for 13 years. But it didn't win much love from theatre critics; Variety was not unusually harsh in dubbing it \"bloated, padded, gimmick-ridden, tacky and, despite the millions, utterly devoid of imagination\". It was widely seen as a cash-in – more like an extension of Disneyland than an imaginative piece of art in its own right.\nIt would be a very different story with The Lion King – which the New York Times immediately praised on its 1997 world premiere as being\"miles away from standard Disney fare\". Yet Taymor recalls that, from the very beginning, the head honchos at Disney were remarkably open to whatever ideas she cooked up. \"They didn't actually have a very strong idea at all about how to do this, which was quite great – it left the door wide open.\" The door was so wide, in fact, that they weren't even sure The Lion King would be a Broadway musical; as Taymor recalls, early discussions kicked around the idea of a stadium show, or something at a planetarium.\nBut Taymor does recall how an early workshop showcasing the \"double event\" mask concept spooked some of the money men. Michael Eisner, Disney's chief executive, Joe Roth, the studio chief, and what Taymor describes as \"a bunch of the top people at Disney – but not theatre people\" all came to see what she was cooking up. But the masks were too big; the costumes were unfinished; one of the puppeteers seemed determined to upstage his own puppet… \"I got major doubt from the movie guys,\" admits Taymor.\nHer response was: \"OK, let's do a test – because I don't want doubt, and I have nothing to sell. If you don't think the puppetry and the double event masks are right, we'll do something else.\" She put together three different, fully realised visions for The Lion King: a commedia dell'arte approach, with half masks that were smaller and more human; aCats-style version, with face-paint, and her double event approach, with the masks on the head.\n\"All three worked,\" says Taymor. \"So I said to Michael Eisner 'which one do you want?' He said 'let's go with your original concept. It's risky, but the bigger the risk, the bigger the payoff.'\" It was a leap of faith that surely helped the musical become the success it is – and surely also helped pave the way for other puppet-starring theatrical hits, from War Horse to Life of Pi, Encores!'s recent Broadway revival of Into the Woods or the Royal Shakespeare Company's new stage version of Studio Ghibli hit My Neighbour Totoro.\nThe Lion King musical may be most famous for its visual style, but Taymor's journey started not with the look of the piece, but with the story, which she worked on with writers Roger Allers and Irene Mecchi. A brisk 88-minutes long, the movie needed to be expanded, Taymor felt, to sustain a two-act musical.\nAt one point in the development process, she came up with a whole new, high-concept second half, where Simba ended up in a Las Vegas style city in the desert. \"It was very Broadway – there was a pussycat lounge with all these lionesses and lounge lizards, and a jaguar who is a car… Simba becomes a boxer, and is made into the lion king. It was really kind of crazy, and Tom [Schumacher]'s mouth just dropped open.\"\nDisney may not have known what they wanted – but they knew they didn't wantthat.In the end, the musical follows the film's story closely, although Simba's years in the wilderness with Timon and Pumbaa are expanded, with the young lion having to rescue his friends from a waterfall. Taymor says she was inspired by various archetypal coming-of-age and prodigal-son narratives. \"If the hero is going to go and then come back as the lion king, what does he have to experience to earn that right?\"\nMore like this\n•The Swinging 60s icon who revolutionised style\n•The 'gay Clueless' that became a cult classic\n•The cult 90s show that changed TV forever\nThen there was also some urgent work to be done on the female characters. \"The female characters were not profound or deep in the original, so I said 'we gotta change this',\" remembers Taymor. Rafiki, the baboon, became more central to the story as a female shaman or Sangoma, while Simba's love interest Nala is given more  focus, stage time, and more agency.\nAnother eureka moment along the way came with the music. Obviously, Elton John's soundtrack to the animation features some of the catchiest Disney songs ever (The Circle of Life, Hakuna Matata, Can You Feel the Love Tonight?). But, beloved as they are, there were not enough of them for a whole show.\nThe film also featured music by South African composer Lebo M, who along with Hans Zimmer released a record called Rhythm of the Pride Lands in 1995, featuring more traditionally South African music sung in languages such as Xhosa, Swahili, Sotho and Zulu. When Schumacher gave this record to Taymor, the choral nature of the singing unlocked something in her imagination: \"Now I had my population – I had the possibility to have a chorus of birds singing, a chorus of zebras dancing! This was very thrilling.\"\nLebo M was brought into the project, and provided several more new songs for the show. \"Lebo became an equal composer to Elton, and brought that other side – the African spiritual side – to the music, in songs like They Live in You, Shadowlands… These are very important to the musical of The Lion King.\"\nShowcasing African languages and choral singing styles in the show \"wasn't really for political reasons,\" says Taymor, \"it was more that it was beautiful. It was moving. It sounded great.\" But it did have an impact on casting, with Taymor stipulating that The Lion King should have \"a predominantly African-American or African cast\", with only the fools (Timon and Pumbaa; Zazu) or the villain (Scar) played by white actors. Andthatin turn has had a notable knock-on effect in providing opportunities for several generations of non-white performers, helping diversify the world of commercial musicals.\n\"There's no doubt that The Lion King, 27 years ago in America, and 25 years ago in London, was doing something very few other musicals had done – it wasn't about race, but it brought in the talent of this huge pool of actors that weren't necessarily going to be used in the white musicals at the time. We all feel very proud about that.\"\nNonetheless, Taymor is still a white American woman telling a story set in Africa, through a fusion of styles that draws on many different performance traditions, from Japanese puppetry to African masks. If it was made today, there might well be questions about cultural appropriation.\nTaymor would refute any such accusations. \"When you just lift up a style of theatre and plunk it down… maybe you can say that's inappropriate. But inspiration, techniques, and styles have [always] criss-crossed across the planet.\" She is keen to point out that there is absolutely zero Japanese Bunraku puppetry or Balinese shadow puppetry in The Lion King – there are only techniquesinspiredby those traditions. \"We borrow. It's the beauty of what we share as humans.\"\nAnd Taymor was fully immersed in exploring such techniques from the very start of her career: after college, she had a fellowship to study theatre in Eastern Europe, Indonesia and Japan. She intended to be in Indonesia for three months – and stayed for four years. \"It changed my life,\" she says. \"As an artist, I was born there. I was lucky to be in Java and Bali before the onslaught of tourism, and saw a culture where theatre was the most powerful form of entertainment and education. It was the most fundamental thing that you could participate in.\"\nAt just 21, she set up her own theatre company there and worked with Sumatran, Balinese and Javanese mask dancers, actors, puppeteers and musicians to create and tour her own shows – productions she'd eventually bring to Western audiences, too.\nBroadway can be a cruel mistress – as Taymor would later discover with the ill-fated Spider-Man musical,Turn Off the Dark. If The Lion King was the Broadway dream, Spider-Man was the ultimate nightmare: a stunt and tech-heavy show with music by Bono and The Edge, it went wildly over-budget and its opening was much-delayed, with several performers injured in previews. It also became mired in artistic differences that saw Taymor replaced as director; she later ended up in a legal battle with the producers over royalties that wassettled out of court.\nSuch extreme triumphs or disasters are pretty rare – but you can never really tell if a show has got that special magic until it's in front of an audience. Still, when it came to The Lion King, Taymor remembers a sense that something specialwashappening during rehearsals. \"We had the puppet room, the choreography room, my main rehearsal room… during our breaks, I'd wander into the choreography rooms and my mouth would drop. Or I'd wander into the puppet workshop and see how they were bringing them to life. Or they would all come into my room and say, 'holy shit, look at the giraffes'. We were our own audience, and we got excited.\"\nThe show continues to excite audiences today – well over a hundred million people have seen The Lion King. But the first real moment Taymor got an inkling of just how successful the musical might be was at its first performance. The production has always opened with the cast of animals coming in through the auditorium – zebras, cheetahs, gazelles and giraffes moving down the aisle and through the audience. It's a famous element of the show now, but it took early audiences by surprise, in the very best way.\n\"In the first performance, people were screaming when the animals came down the aisle – we didn't expect that. We were so overwhelmed by the audience reaction, we just started crying,\" Taymor recalls. They had a hit – and a new kind of musical was born.\nThe Lion Kingis at the Lyceum Theatre, London and the Minskoff Theatre, New York.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "The recent discovery of an art forger's workshop reminds us of the long history of fraudulent artworks – here are the simple rules to work them out.\nIt's everywhere: fake news, deep fakes, identity fraud. So ensnared are we in a culture of digitised deceptions, a phenomenon increasingly augmentedby artificial intelligence, it would be easy to think that deceit itself is a high-tech invention of the cyber age. Recent revelations however – from the discovery of an elaborate, if decidedly low-tech,art forger's workshop in Rometo the sensational allegation that a cherished Baroque masterpiece in London's National Gallery isa crude simulacrum of a lost original– remind us that duplicity in the world of art has a long and storied history, one written not in binary ones and zeroes, but in impossible pigments, clumsy brushstrokes and suspicious signatures. When it comes to falsification and phoniness, there is indeed no new thing under the Sun.\nOn 19 February, Italy's Carabinieri Command for the Protection of Cultural Heritage uncovered a covert forgery operation in a northern district of Rome. Authorities confiscated more than 70 fraudulent artworks falsely attributed to notable artists from Pissarro to Picasso, Rembrandt to Dora Maar, along with materials used to mimic vintage canvases, artist signatures, and the stamps of galleries no longer in operation. The suspect, who has yet to be apprehended, is thought to have used online platforms such as Catawiki and eBay to hawk their phoney wares, deceiving potential buyers with convincing certificates of authenticity that they likewise contrived.\nNews of the clandestine lab's discovery was quickly followed by publicity for a new book, due for release this week, alleging that one of The National Gallery's highlights is not at all what it seems. According to artist and historian Euphrosyne Doxiadis, author of NG6461: The Fake National Gallery Rubens, the painting Samson and Delilah – a large oil-on-wood attributed to the 17th Century Flemish master Peter Paul Rubens and purchased by the London museum in 1980 for £2.5m (thenthe second-highest price ever paid for a painting at auction) – is three centuries younger than the date of 1609-10 that sits beside it on the gallery wall and is incalculably less accomplished than the museum believes.\nDoxiadis's conclusion corroborates one reached in 2021 by the Swiss company, Art Recognition, which determined, through the use of AI, that there was a 91% probability that Samson and Delilah is the work of someone other than Rubens. Her assertion that the brushwork we see in the painting is crass and wholly inconsistent with the fluid flow of the Flemish master's hand is strongly contested by The National Gallery, which stands by its attribution. \"Samson and Delilah has long been accepted by leading Rubens scholars as a masterpiece by Peter Paul Rubens\", it said in a statement given to the BBC. \"Painted on wood panel in oil shortly after his return to Antwerp in 1608 and demonstrating all that the artist had learned in Italy, it is a work of the highest aesthetic quality. A technical examination of the picture was presented in an article in The National Gallery's Technical Bulletin in 1983. The findings remain valid.\"\nThe divergence of opinion between the museum's experts and those who doubt the work's authenticity opens a curious space in which to reflect on intriguing questions of artistic value and merit. Is there ever legitimacy in forgery? Can fakes be masterpieces? As more sophisticated tools of analysis are applied to paintings and drawings whose legitimacy has long been in question (including several works attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, such as the hotly disputed chalk and ink drawingLa Bella Principessa), as well as those whose validity has never been in doubt, debates about the integrity of cultural icons are only likely to accelerate. What follows are a handful of handy principles to keep in mind when navigating the impending controversies – five simple rules for spotting a fake masterpiece.\nTo be a successful art forger requires more than technical proficiency and a misplaced ethical compass. It isn't enough to approximate the dibby-dabby dots of a Georges Seurat, say, or the thick expressive swirls of Vincent van Gogh. You need to know your history as well as your chemistry. Anachronistic pigments will give you away every time and were the downfall ofGerman art forger Wolfgang Beltracchi and his wife Helene, who succeeded in selling makeshift modernist masterpieces for millions before a careless squeeze of prefab paint onto their audacious palettes in 2006 sealed their fate.\nBeltracchi, whose modus operandi was to create \"new\" works by everyone from Max Ernst to André Derain, rather than recreate lost ones, was always careful to mix his own paints to ensure they contained only ingredients available to whomever he was attempting to impersonate. He only slipped up once. And that was enough. Fabricating a wonky Der Blaue Reiter-ish red landscape of jigsawed horses that he attributed to the German Expressionist Heinrich Campendonk, Beltracchi reached for a readymade tube of paint, which he hadn't realised contained a pinch of titanium white – a relatively new pigment to which Campendonk would not have had access. It was all investigators would need to prove the work, which had sold for €2.8m, was a fake.\nBeltracchi was unlucky. The gap between titanium white's availability and its potential use by Campendonk was only a few years. On occasion, the divide is shockingly wide. Analysis of a Portrait of Saint Jerome, once attributed to the Italian master Parmigianino andsold by Sotheby's auction house in 2012 for $842,500, exposed the prevalence throughout the work of phthalocyanine green, a synthetic pigment invented in 1935, four centuries after the 16th-Century Renaissance artist worked. Artists may be visionaries, but they're not time travellers.\nIt is uplifting to believe that one's value, as a person, is not tethered to the past. Not so with art. A painting, sculpture, or drawing without a heavy history is not, alas, more inspiring for its lack of baggage. It is suspicious. Or rather, it should be. All too often, greed can interfere in the clear-sightedness of assessing the authenticity of a painting or sculpture. Things have histories we want them to have. That was certainly the case with a succession of phoney Vermeers that issued from the workshop of a Dutch portraitist, Han van Meegeren – one of the most prolific and successful forgers of the 20th Century. Desperate to believe that the miraculous appearance of canvases, including a depiction of Christ and The Men at Emmaus, might be lost masterpieces from the same hand that madeGirl with a Pearl Earringand The Milkmaid, collectors were blind to the glaring absence of any trace of the paintings' provenance – their prior ownership, exhibition history, and proof of sales. Everyone was fooled.\nIn authenticating the painting in the Burlington Magazine, one expert insisted \"in no other picture by the great Master of Delft do we find such sentiment, such a profound understanding of the Bible story – a sentiment so nobly human expressed through the medium of the highest art\". But it was all a lie. In a remarkable twist, Van Meegeren eventually chose to expose himself as a fraudster shortly after the end of World War Two, after being charged by Dutch authorities with the crime of selling a Vermeer – therefore a national treasure – to the Nazi official Hermann Göring. To prove his innocence, if innocence it might be called, and demonstrate that he had merely sold a worthless fake of his own forging, not a real Old Master, Van Meegeren performed the extraordinary feat of whisking up a fresh masterpiece from thin air before the experts' astonished eyes. Voilà, Vermeer.\nMore recently, in a 2017 episode of BBC's popular arts programme Fake or Fortune?, presenter Philip Mould's long-held hunch that a painting he once sold for £35,000 was really a priceless original by the English Romantic artist John Constable – an alternative, and previously undocumented, view of the landscape artist's 1821 masterpieceThe Hay Wain– was dramatically confirmed after Mould and fellow presenter Fiona Bruce excavated long-buried financial records. Having traced the painting's ownership back to a sale by the artist's son, the team recalculated the canvass true value to be £2m, proving that some pasts are worth hanging onto.\nArtists' gestures – their simultaneously studied and instinctive brushwork and draughtsmanship – are nothing less than fingerprints writ large across canvases and works on paper. One artist's lightness of touch and another's sturdiness of stroke are exceedingly tricky to falsify, especially if you are conscious that every twitch of your brush and jot of your pen will be scrutinised by suspicious eyes and cutting-edge equipment. Pressure under pressure is hard to maintain, an obstacle that the British forger Eric Hebborn (who died under suspicious circumstancesin Rome in 1996 after a career spent counterfeiting more than 1,000 works attributed to everyone from Mantegna to Tiepolo, Poussin to Piranesi)overcame with alcohol.\nBy all accounts, brandy was Hebborn's tipple of choice for calming his rattling nerves. It allowed him to inhabit, without inhibition, the mind and muscle of whichever old master he was channelling. Whereas fakes from the hands of Beltracchi and Van Meegeren have since been found under closer inspection to be riddled with incoherent gestures, the fluidity of drawings falsified by the tipsy Hebborn in his heyday in the 1970s and 80s continues to confound the experts. To this day, institutions that possess works that passed through his hands refuse to accept they are all fakes, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art's pen and ink drawing View of the Temples of Venus and of Diana in Baia from the South, a work it still insists is from the circle of Jan Brueghel the Elder.What do you think?\nWhen the analysis of pigments, provenance, and paintbrush pressure still leaves you stumped, it may be necessary to dive a little deeper. For 20 years since the 1990s, the authenticity of a still life purportedly by Vincent van Gogh was serially confirmed and refuted by experts. To some, the garish reds and submarine blues that echoed eerily from the bouquet of roses, daisies, and wildflowers didn't have the ring of truth and seemed at odds with the painter's palette. The absence of any ownership record for the painting didn't help.\nBut an X-ray undertaken in 2012 put questions to rest when it revealed that the artist, pinching pennies, reused a canvas on which he had created another image entirely – one to which he makes explicit reference in a letter from January 1886. \"This week\", Van Gogh remarked to his brother Theo, \"I painted a large thing with two nude torsos – two wrestlers… and I really like doing that.\" As if proleptically anticipating the ensuing scholarly wrangle over the work's authenticity that the painting would in time trigger, the static tussle of the two athletes, trapped beneath paint for over a century, not only rescued the work from unfair allegations of illegitimacy, it created a kind of fresh composite painting, a vivid compression – a freeze frame of a restless mind forever scuffling with itself, desperate to survive.\nAs a final safeguard in authenticating a work of art, run the spell check. Doing sowould have saved the collector Pierre Lagrange $17m– the price he paid in 2007 for an otherwise compelling forgery of a small 12x18in (30x46cm) painting falsely attributed to the American Abstract Expressionist Jackson Pollock. Famous for his drippy style, Pollock has a surprisingly legible signature, an unmistakable \"c\" before the final \"k\". The skipped consonant would do more than expose a single forgery; it would shatter the reputation of an entire gallery.\nThe sloppy signature was just one of many missed red flags in works falsely attributed to Rothko, De Kooning, Motherwell and others that the Knoedler & Co gallery, one of New York's oldest and most esteemed art institutions, succeeded in selling for $80m. The fraudulent works had been supplied by a dubious dealer who claimed they came from an enigmatic collector, \"Mr X\". Just before the scandal erupted in the press, the gallery closed its doors after 165 years, while the suspected perpetrator of the fakes, a self-taught Chinese septuagenarian by the name of Pei-Shen Qian, who had operated from a forger's workshop in Queens, vanished;he later turned up in China.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "The building of the Sydney Opera House began on 2 March 1959. But when BBC Tonight visited the construction site in 1965, it was plagued by technical problems, soaring costs, vacillating public opinion and political infighting.\nIn 1965, BBC reporter Trevor Philpott sat overlooking Sydney Harbour as he tried to find the right metaphor to describe the vibrant, arching structures of Jørn Utzon's roof design for the Australian city's Opera House. \"It was a score of towering shells. It was a cluster of seagulls spreading concrete wings. It was a huddle of sailing boats with billowing concrete sails,\" said Philpott. He then added the caveat: \"And it was an unmitigated bitch to build.\"\nThe fraught saga of the Sydney Opera House's construction began on 2 March 1959, 66 years ago this week. Six years after that, when BBC Tonight's Philpott went to see the building's progress, it was already years behind schedule, mired in spiralling costs, changing designs and escalating political tensions. To say it was having a difficult birth would be an understatement.\nThe idea to build an opera house for the city had been proposed in the late 1940s by an acclaimed English conductor, Sir Eugene Goossens. At the time, Goossens was something of a celebrity in the classical music world, having carved out a successful career in the UK and the US. After World War Two, he had been lured to Sydney to become the director of the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music with the promise of a salary greater than that of the Australian Prime Minister, musicologist Dr Drew Crawford told the BBC podcastA Very Australian Scandalin 2023.\nThe creation of a new, world-class music performance venue was the conductor's passion project. He had spied from his office window what he believed was the ideal site for it – the tram depot at Bennelong Point. Known to the local indigenous Gadigal people of the Eora nation as Tubowgule, it was a place where Aboriginal celebrations had been held for thousands of years. Throughout the 1950s, Goossens lobbied hard, trying to turn his dream into a reality. \"There were very few other people who could have that vision, articulate that vision, and have the ear of the Premier [of New South Wales], have the ear of the Prime Minister, be able to talk to people to get it going,\" said Dr Crawford.\nGoossens convinced the Premier of New South Wales, Joseph Cahill, that an opera house would reshape the world's view of Australia, that he had found the perfect site for it, and that they should launch \"a grand competition, open to the architects of all the world, to decide exactly what manner of a building they should put there\", said Philpott. \"They made only one condition, that nothing quite so remarkable should have been ever built before.\"\nGoossens himself would not get to see his ambition realised. In 1956, having just picked up his knighthood in the UK, he was detained upon his entry back into Australia, where his bags were searched and found to contain, among other things, smuggled pornography, compromising photographs and rubber masks. The resultingscandal, which involved affairs, erotica and witchcraft, completely scuppered the conductor's career in Sydney. He fled the country for Rome, traveling under the alias of Mr E Gray, never to return.\nHowever, the design competition went ahead as planned, with a panel of judges evaluating some 233 submitted entries. At the start 1957, the government announced that a largely unknown Danish architect, Utzon, was the unexpected winner. Part of the surprise at Utzon's success was that his entry had largely consisted of preliminary sketches and concept drawings. \"As far as building anything of any scale, he hadn't really done very much,\" Sir Jack Zunz, who worked on the project for the civil engineering firm Arup, toldBBC Witness Historyin 2018.\nThe judges' choice of Utzon's bold and imaginative design was not without controversy. \"From the first, it stirred the people of Sydney to breathless wonder and scalding abuse,\" said Philpott. \"It was called the Sydney Harbour monster, a piece of Danish pastry, a disintegrating circus tent.\"\nPremier Cahill, worried that the project might be derailed by adverse public opinion or political opposition, pushed for construction work to start early. This was despite the fact that Utzon was still finalising the building's actual design, and had yet to resolve critical structural issues. Although Utzon's design was thought to be one of the cheapest, there were still problems raising money for it, so a State Lottery was launched in 1957 to help fund the project.\nThe initial estimate of the final cost of the Sydney Opera House was put at A£3.5m or A$7m – at the time, Australia's official currency was the pound, but was replaced by the dollar in 1966. The building was set to open on 26 January 1963: Australia Day. Both of these predictions would prove to be wildly and hopelessly optimistic. \"Right from the beginning, the house was full of trouble: human, mechanical, structural,\" reported Philpott.\nThe building of the Opera House was divided into three distinct phases: construction of the podium, the roof shells, and the interior. Cahill, having persuaded the Minister of Transport to agree to the tram depot being demolished to build the podium, \"found the site was neither big enough nor strong enough to carry that structure that seemed on paper light enough to fly away,\" said Philpott.\nTo bear the weight of the Opera House, the whole site needed to be extended and reinforced by driving over 550 steel-cased concrete shafts, each three feet in diameter, into land in and around Sydney Harbour. This extensive work, which had not been accounted for in either the construction's budget or its timescale, dragged on, hampered by bad weather. The podium would only be completed in January 1963 – the original date for when the Opera House was meant to open.\nBut this would merely be the first of the project's delays and eye-watering extra costs. The Opera House's most distinctive feature, its roof shells which mimicked a ship's sails, were to present a whole other set of engineering headaches. Initially, the plan had been to make the roof out of steel coated with concrete. However, that design presented unwelcome noise problems for any performance taking place. \"The Opera House stars would have been singing above the sirens of the tugboats on the water outside, and the temperature variations would have caused the metal and concrete to rumble and crack like tropical thunder,\" said Philpott.\nNobody had also fully understood the scale of the engineering challenge that the Opera House's daring curved roof surfaces presented. Since Utzon's entry lacked detailed engineering plans, civil engineering firm Arup had been brought in to work out how to construct the roof's complex shell structure. But despite trying multiple different redesigns, they could not make the structural calculations add up. \"The first thing Arup did when they were asked to collaborate, they took these free shapes and developed a series of mathematical models which, near as possible, matched Utzon's competition design. None of these shapes appeared buildable,\" Zunz told BBC Witness History.\nAnother issue was that, because the roof was curved, each concrete rib that supported it would be different. That meant that instead of having just one mould that could be reused to cast all the supporting beams, each individual rib would need a separate one. This was prohibitively expensive.\nThe answer, Utzon would later claim, came to him while he was peeling an orange. The architect realised that all segments of the roof could come from the geometry of a single sphere. By identifying which part of the sphere best suited the shapes they needed, a series of triangles each with one curved side could be cut from it, creating a variety of shells. These spherical shell segments could be broken down into individual components, which could be uniformly pre-cast in concrete and assembled onsite. \"He came back a week later and said, 'I've solved it.' And he made the scheme out of a sphere,\" said Arup's Zunz. \"But in so doing, he had changed the architecture quite radically.\"\nThis elegant solution simplified the roof's construction and reduced waste, enabling the building of the vaulted roof to begin in 1963. But as the contractors worked on executing Utzon's vision, the project was dogged by labour disputes, design changes and rising material costs, making its budget balloon and its potential completion date disappear into the distance. \"By 1962, the cost had risen to A£12.5m, and now everybody admitted they were only guessing,\" said Philpott. \"The opening day was postponed and postponed again. It had been planned for Australia Day 1963, it was put off until early 1964, then until sometime in 1966, and now no one is bold enough even to predict the year the doors may eventually open.\"\nThe project's biggest government supporter, Premier Cahill, had taken ill just months after building work had started. On his deathbed in 1959, he had made his Minister for Public Works, Norman Ryan, promise not to let the Opera House fail. Ryan, when interviewed by the BBC's Philpott in 1965, gamely made a spirited defence of the project, but by this time frustration with its mounting costs and endless delays was palpable. \"I wasn't sure whether to admit to working on it at the time,\" admitted Zunz. \"If you went into a taxi, you got an earful of all the money that was being wasted, and God knows what.\"\nAdding to this contentious atmosphere, a few months after Ryan's BBC interview, Robert Askin, who had vocally opposed the project, was elected the New South Wales Premier. He appointed Davis Hughes as the new Minister for Public Works, who clashed repeatedly with Utzon. Hughes, determined to rein in spending, began to challenge the architect's costs and schedules, demanding a full set of working drawings for the interiors – the next stage of the project. \"The whole situation started going downhill,\" said Zunz. \"Utzon couldn't, wouldn't, anyway didn't produce the documents his client desired.\" In retaliation, Hughes refused the payments demanded by the construction team, which left Utzon unable to pay his staff. In 1966, the Danish architect resigned from the project and left Australia, never returning to see his Opera House completed.\nUtzon's resignation led to a public outcry, with 1,000 people taking to Sydney's streets on 3 March 1966 to demand that he be reinstated. Instead, Hughes appointed a new panel of Australian architects to complete the interior as well as the glass walls. But if Hughes thought this would reduce costs and speed up the project, he was very much mistaken.\nThe new team scrapped most of Utzon's plans for the interior and radically redesigned it. Utzon had envisioned a dual purpose for the main hall, as an opera venue and a concert hall, but this was now viewed as unworkable, leading to the already installed stage production machinery having to be demolished. The new design also meant that each of the hundreds of pieces of glass in the interior walls needed to be cut to a unique size and shape, which continued to pile on the costs. The Sydney Opera House's spiralling bill was pushed even higher when a labour dispute by union workers, over the dismissal of a worker and demands for better wages, culminated in a sit-in strike at the site in 1972.\nBut the following year, the monumental undertaking that was the construction of the Sydney Opera House was finally completed. Ten years late and 14 times over its initial budget, it came in at a cost of A$102m (£51m).\nIt was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 October 1973. The monarch praised the stunning building that had \"captured the imagination of the world\" while also wryly mentioning that \"I understand that its construction has not been totally without problems\". Utzondeclined to attendits opening, writing to Premier Askin that he couldn't \"see anything positive\" in the interior work done by the Australian architects and it would not be possible for him \"to avoid making very negative statements\".\nMore like this:\n•The first ever video game console\n•How the fall of the Berlin Wall reshaped Europe\n•How music saved a cellist's life in Auschwitz\nThe Danish architect did end up making peace and reengaging with the Sydney Opera House project in 1999, agreeing to work on the A$66m (£33m) renovation of its interior. In September 2004, the Reception Hall was renamedthe Utzon Roomin his honour after being redesigned by him.\nIn the years since its completion, acclaim for Sydney Opera House'svisionary architecturehas only grown. Its distinctive sculptural form has made it one of the most immediately recognisable buildings in the world. More than 10.9m people visit it annually, and it has come to epitomise theAustralian national identity, its soaring roof a celebration of creativity, culture and ambition in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.\nAs avenue, it has played host to everyone from Bob Dylan, Ella Fitzgerald and Sammy Davis Jnr to The Cure, Björk and Massive Attack. In 1980, Arnold Schwarzenegger won his final body-building title there, and 10 years later anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela made one of his first major speeches from its steps following his release from prison. In 2004, Cathy Freeman, the first Aboriginal athlete to win an individual Olympic gold medal, opened the Olympic torch relay from outside the building. Its eye-catching roof is illuminated every year as part of Vivid Sydney, the city's festival of light, music and ideas, and in 2017, stories of Indigenous Australia told in vibrant animations were projected onto it.\nIn 2007, the building that had been brought about by a combination of art, engineering and sheer bloody-minded perseverance was formally recognised as a World Heritage Site by Unesco. On recommending its inclusion, the International Council on Monuments and Sites declared: \"The Sydney Opera House stands by itself as one of the indisputable masterpieces of human creativity, not only in the 20th Century but in the history of humankind.\"\nFor more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to theIn History newsletter, whileThe Essential Listdelivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "It has been dubbed one of the world's rarest treasure troves of art but few people outside its host country know about it.\nFor decades, masterpieces by the likes of Pablo Picasso, Vincent Van Gogh, Andy Warhol and Jackson Pollock have been kept in the basement of a museum in Iran's capital Tehran, shrouded in mystery.\nAccording to estimates in 2018, the collection is worthas much as $3bn.\nOnly a small portion of the work has been exhibited since the 1979 Iranian Revolution but in recent years, the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art has been showcasing some of its most captivating pieces.\nThe Eye to Eye exhibition at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art, which opened in October 2024, was extended twice due to overwhelming public demand, running until January 2025.\nThe display was widely regarded as one of the most significant exhibitions in the history of the museum, and it also became its most visited.\nThe showcase featured more than 15 works unveiled for the first time, including a sculpture by Jean Dubuffet - marking its first-ever appearance in an Iranian exhibition.\nFrom abstract expressionism to pop art, the collection at the museum serves as a time capsule of pivotal artistic movements.\nAmong the artwork is Warhol's portrait of Farah Pahlavi - Iran's last queen - a rare piece blending his pop art flair with Iranian cultural history.\nElsewhere, Francis Bacon's work called Two Figures Lying on a Bed with Attendants shows figures appearing to spy on two naked men lying on a bed.\nOn the opposite wall in the basement of the museum, a portrait of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, is on display in juxtaposition.\nThe museum was built in 1977 under the patronage of Pahlavi, the exiled widow of the last Shah of Iran who was overthrown during the revolution.\nPahlavi was a passionate art advocate and her cousin, architect Kamran Diba, designed the museum.\nIt was established to introduce modern art to Iranians and to bridge Iran closer to the international art scene.\nThe museum soon became home to a stunning array of works by luminaries including Picasso, Warhol and Salvador Dali, alongside pieces by leading Iranian modernists, and quickly established itself as a beacon of cultural exchange and artistic ambition.\nBut then came the 1979 revolution. Iran became an Islamic republic as the monarchy was overthrown and clerics assumed political control under Ayatollah Khomeini.\nMany artworks were deemed inappropriate for public display because of nudity, religious sensitivities or political implications.\nPierre-Auguste Renoir's Gabrielle with Open Blouse was deemed too scandalous. And Warhol's portrait of the former queen of Iran was too political. In fact, Pahlavi's portrait was vandalised and torn apart with a knife during the revolutionary turmoil.\nAfter the revolution, many of the artworks were locked away, collecting dust in a basement that became the stuff of art world legend.\nIt was only in the late 1990s that the museum reclaimed its cultural significance during the reformist presidency of Mohammad Khatami.\nSuddenly the world remembered what it had been missing. Art lovers could not believe their eyes. Van Gogh, Dali, even Monet - all in Tehran.\nSome pieces were loaned to major exhibitions in Europe and the United States, briefly reconnecting the collection with the global art world.\nHamid Keshmirshekan, an art historian based in London, has studied the collection and calls it \"one of the rarest treasure troves of modern art outside the West\".\nThe collection includes Henry's Moore's Reclining Figure series - an iconic piece by one of Britain's most celebrated sculptors - and Jackson Pollock's Mural on Indian Red Ground, a vibrant example of the American's painting technique pulsing with energy and emotion.\nPicasso's The Painter and His Model - his largest canvas from 1927 - also features, a strong example of his abstract works from the post-cubism period.\nAnd there is Van Gogh's At Eternity's Gate - one of the very rare survivals of his first printmaking campaign during which he produced six lithographs in November 1882.\nBut for art lovers in Britain, the collection is out of reach. The UK Foreign Office advises against all travel to Iran and says British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention.\nHaving a British passport or connections to the UK can be reason enough for detention by the Iranian authorities, it says.\nChallenges remain for the museum which operates under a tight budget. Shifting political priorities mean that it often functions more as a cultural hub than a traditional museum.\nYet it continues to be a remarkable institution - an unlikely guardian of modern art masterpieces in the heart of Tehran."

    "content": "The colour survives in the work of 17th Century Spanish colonial painters, a symbol of the wealth that ultimately doomed the Maya, writes Devon Van Houten Maldonado.\nIn 17th Century Europe, when Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio and Peter Paul Rubens painted their famous masterworks, ultramarine blue pigment made from the semi-precious lapis lazuli stone was mined far away in Afghanistan and cost more than its weight in gold. Only the most illustrious painters were allowed to use the costly material, while lesser artists were forced to use duller colours that faded under the sun. It wasn’t until the industrial revolution in the 19th Century that a synthetic alternative was invented, and true ultramarine blue finally became widely available.\nAcross the Atlantic Ocean, colonial Baroque works created by artists like José Juárez, Baltasar de Echave Ibia and Cristóbal de Villalpando in early 17th Century Mexico – New Spain – were full of this beautiful blue. How could this be? Lapis lazuli was even rarer in the New World. It wasn’t until the middle of the 20th Century that archaeologists discovered the Maya had invented a resilient and brilliant blue, centuries before their land was colonised and their resources exploited.\n- What connects Adam and Eve to Tinder\n-The world’s most mysterious silver cups\n-How Van Gogh found Japan in Provence\nThe ultramarine blue procured from lapis lazuli in Europe was not only incredibly expensive, but also extremely laborious to make. In Europe, blue was reserved for the most important subject matter. Rubens' Adoration of the Magi – the version that hangs in the Museo del Prado in Madrid and which he worked on for over 20 years – is an example. The colour was primarily used to paint the robes of the Virgin Mary, and later extended to include other royalty and holy figures. In Mexico, on the other hand, blue was used to paint altogether less holy and everyday subjects.\nArchaeologists studying pre-Hispanic Mesoamerican ruins were surprised by the discovery of blue murals in the Maya Riviera, modern day Mexico and Guatemala, from as early as 300 AD, perhaps the most famous being the murals at the temple of Chichén Itzá (created around 450 AD). The colour had a special ceremonial significance for the Maya. They covered sacrificial victims and the altars on which they were offered in a brilliant blue paint, writes Diego de Landa Calderón, a bishop in colonial Mexico during the 16th Century, in his first-hand account.\nArchaeologists were puzzled by the resilience of the blue in the murals. The añil plant, part of the indigo family, was widely available in the region but was mostly used for dyes rather than paint. Indigo was quick to fade in the sunlight and natural elements, so experts mused that the Maya couldn’t have used the same widely available dye to paint the murals. It wasn’t until the late 1960s that the source of Maya blue’s resilience through the centuries was discovered: a rare clay called attapulgite, which was mixed with the dye from the añil plant. During colonisation native materials like Maya blue and cochineal were exploited along with every other resource of the land and its people in the New World. These colours, which supposedly represented the wealth of the Maya empire, would stand as a symbol of all that would be plundered.\nRhapsody in blue\nMaster painters from the Americas are discussed in art history – if they’re mentioned at all – as a lesser school of Baroque compared to Caravaggio and Rubens. It's overly simplistic to assume that these Baroque masters were only impersonating their European predecessors. In fact, second and third generation painters born in Mexico City, such as Juárez and Echave Ibia, departed from European aesthetics, but arrived to something uniquely layered: enormous and sophisticated compositions that drew upon the full vibrancy of the New World. At Mexico’s National Art Museum (Munal) in Mexico City, works by Juárez seen chronologically show his development from a European impersonator to a New Spanish Baroque master. His early canvases departed from the dramatic spotlighting and warmth of European Baroque imagery and later moved into cold saturation throughout the picture plane (vibrant blues, yellows, greens and reds), multiple light sources, collaged compositions and grand scale – and in part because the use of local materials, such as Maya blue, expanded his palette.\nWhile Rubens also used vibrant colours, his compositions, on the whole, were more chaotic and warmer than those of Juárez. His pallet was even more vibrant than Rubens’, perhaps the most vibrant of the European Baroques, but his compositions were more akin to Caravaggio. Caravaggio's canvases were, without fail, full of rich reds and yellows, but nearly devoid of blue – if you think of a Caravaggio masterpiece, blue is usually absent. The closest to a blue-tinted Caravaggio you can find is Juárez’s work, but, despite his prolific reach and realised compositions, Juárez died in poverty.  If Juárez died without a peso to his name, how would he have had the resources to order large quantities of precious lapis lazuli from Europe?\nOn the other hand, Villalpando, often said to be the most prolific colonial painter in New Spain, imitated the chaotic compositions by Rubens. Villalpando fits more neatly into the European history of Baroque painting and didn't depart from Rubens' ‘fear of space’ – the Baroque notion that every space of the canvas must crammed with imagery and incident – thus he was accepted by the canon of art history as the mascot of Novohispanic Baroque painting. Still, as much as he wanted to imitate Rubens, Villalpando painted with Mesoamerican materials and labour. The consistent result – the same as his peers in Mexico – was that his paintings and murals were cooler and more saturated. His mural adorning the dome of Puebla's cathedral was the first and only of its kind in New Spain. Swirling blue and purple clouds back the images of the virgin, the saints and the angels painted by Villalpando. Even though he sought to make European Baroque in the Americas, his materials gave him away as a criollo, a non-mixed-race descendant of the original Spanish settlers, from Mexico City.\nBaltasar de Echave Ibia painted such elaborate blues that he became known as ‘El Echave de los azules’ (the Echave of the blues). His father, Baltasar de Echave Orio, also used blue generously, but Echave Ibia was especially famous for his copious use and mastery of the colour. There is a reason why Ibia, working in Mexico City between the 17th and 18th Centuries, had access to seemingly limitless amounts of blue. All three had had sources of the brilliant colour closer to home.\nThe lack of written evidence of the use of añil or Maya blue in Novohispanic Baroque paintings is made up for with visual evidence. From these painters and others in the colonised Americas it's apparent that Baroque artists in the New World weren’t using the same blue pigment as their European peers. The lapis lazuli blue being used in Europe was a dark ultramarine blue. While the blue being used in New Spain reflected the vivid azure, originally extracted from añil by the Maya. Maya blue is one of the most durable of all Mesoamerican colours, as seen in the 1,600-year-old murals at Chichén Itzá. Perhaps the same resistance to time has kept Baroque canvases and murals in the Americas, from Mexico to Peru, bright through the centuries.\nThis cross-pollination of influences, from Maya to European Baroque, happening in Latin America on the canvases of criollo painters suggests globalism began much sooner than academic history has led us to believe.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to ourFacebookpage or message us onTwitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called “If You Only Read 6 Things This Week”.

    "content": "Green has symbolised both decay and regeneration, offering a bridge between this world and the next, writes Kelly Grovier.\nBeware of green. It can’t be trusted. Leonardo da Vinci knew, and cautioned his contemporaries against the pigment’s toxic instability. Its beauty, Leonardo warned, “vanishes into thin air”. Volatile and evanescent, green is more than just a colour. It is the energy that connects us to the unknown. Remove green from the palette of art history and a bridge between life and death would disappear. Equal parts morbid and vital, green curdles the cadaverous cheeks of Pablo Picasso’s macabre portrait of his young friend, Carlos Casagemas, who shot himself dead in lovelorn torment at the age of 20, while at the same time ignites with joyous chlorophyllic fire the life-affirming and ever-verdant canvases of Claude Monet.\nMore like this:\n-The insect that painted Europe red\n-The toxic colour that comes from volcanoes\n-The racist message hidden in a masterpiece\nTo dabble in green is not merely to tread a path between being and unbeing, but to make inroads into the mysteries of each. Simultaneously the colour of putrefaction and of verdurous regeneration, green participates with unbiased vividity in decay and rebirth. Perhaps it is green’s teasing ambiguity that compelled Leonardo himself, against his own better counsel, to clad his most famous and enigmatic subject, the Mona Lisa, in a darkening shade of that colour – one that has since bruised itself to a sublime and submarine blackness in the subconscious of cultural history.\nDonning the deepest of shadowy green costumes, La Gioconda night-swims in the vitrine of our psyche and has long been recognised as a mystical commuter between the world of the living and that of the dead. “Like the vampire,” the 19th-Century English essayist Walter Pater once wrote of her, “she has been dead many times and learned the secrets of the grave”. Describing Leonardo’s inscrutable sitter as “older than the rocks among which she sits”, Pater proceeds to imagine that Mona Lisa has, throughout history, returned again and again as everything from “a diver in deep seas” to a savvy operator who has woven “strange webs with Eastern merchants”. Ceaselessly resurgent in her murky green gown, which symbolised her status as a merchant’s wife, Mona, according to Pater, was “the mother of Helen of Troy” and the “mother Mary”.\nLong before Leonardo reached for green, the colour had been assigned a special esoteric place in cultural imagination. Ancient Egyptians reserved green for the bold beryl complexion of their god of life and death, Osiris – ruler of the underworld, who held dominion over the passage of souls between this world and the next. Typical depictions of Osiris, such as one found on the 13th-Century BC walls of the burial tomb of Horemheb, the last monarch of the 18th dynasty of Egypt, portray a skinny, grassy-skinned god, whose false pharaoh’s beard marks him out as a deity of incontestable pre-eminence.\nPerennially young, Osiris was believed to be a serial resuscitator, both of himself and of the natural world. Holding sway over the flow of floods and flourishing of flora alike, leafy-cheeked Osiris, it was believed, would eventually show the souls of Egypt’s kings the path to resurrection.\nFlora and fauna\nFor millennia, concocting green pigments was achieved by a variety of artistic alchemies that harnessed the hues of everything from pulverised malachite to the juice of buckthorn berries, from dessicated foxgloves and fraxinus leaves, to soaking yellow saffron in the purple dye of woad, also known as the ‘The Asp of Jerusalem’. Verdigris, among the more common iterations of the colour, and the one of which Leonardo was most wary, is forged in a curious ritual that involves the slow sousing in wine of a brass or copper blade.\nAn acetic crust of green that scabs to the metallic surface is then scraped clean and ground into pigment. It was a green ghost of similar chemical contrivance that confirmed to scientists digging recently for the remains of the 16th-Century Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe that they had indeed found their target. Known to have worn a prosthetic nose to replace the one he’d lost in a sword fight in 1566, Brahe’s aesthetic skull bore traces of copper and zinc when, like a disciple of Osiris, it eventually came up for air in 2012.\nFertile with life, even in death, the invocation of green in countless masterpieces from antiquity to the present day impregnates our eye with expectancy. Everything about the physique, posture and gestures of Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini’s green-enrobed wife, who seems to rest her tired hand tenderly on her tummy’s bump in Jan van Eyck’s famous painting, The Arnolfini Portrait (painted in 1434), leads our modern mind to suspect that she is pregnant, however convinced art historians may be that she isn’t. The great gush of cascading green that capsizes our eye, scholars contend, is more likely a symbol of hope for the eventual blessing of children. Green springs eternal.\nAn alternative reading of the riddling portrait only amplifies the eeriness of green’s potential to wed the living and the dead. According to one theory, the depiction of the woman in Van Eyck’s work is herself a composite double-portrait of two successive wives of Giovanni di Nicolao – his first having died in childbirth. Supporters of this view point to tropes of death that haunt the painting, such as the extinguished wick on the candle above her. Certainly the complex convex mirror, bolted to the back of the painting, which warps the couple’s reflection as if into a different continuum of reality, compounds the sense of strangely splitting selves that reverberate from the painting. If ever there was a colour capable of cloaking such a curious compression of life and death, it’s green.\nSo green goes, sowing into the story of art the mysteries of our own fleeting appearance in the world. The murky green water that laps against the ochre edge of the River Stour in John Constable’s famous Romantic landscape The Hay Wain, delineates a boundary between the world that the artist can see in the here-and-now and one that haunts his imagination from childhood. Look closer at the weave of summer greenness at which the little dog in the foreground appears to pant, and you can barely discern the ghost of a horseman and barrel that the artist had once intended to include in the painting – a spectre that, over time, is re-sculpting itself from the verdurous summer air that Constable has mystically conjured.\nThough rightly celebrated for the accuracy of his carefully observed clouds, Constable is a master too of earthy hues and terrestrial textures. The tapestry of greens he weaves in The Hay Wain is a tour de force of that colour’s ability to convey the vibrancy of nostalgia for a place that ceaselessly shifts in one’s memory between wilting loss and luminous revelation.\nHiding in plain sight\nIn more recent eras of artistic expression, green has continued to be an enigmatic hue that hides as much as it reveals. Paul Gauguin’s seminal symbolist painting Green Christ (1889) is a teasing tangle of the colour’s contradictory connotations. Over a stone statue of the deceased Christ in the middle distance of the painting, a lucent layer of moss has stitched itself like a second skin. The face of a Breton woman, who stands in the shadow of that sculpture, is tinged a sepulchral green, as if she were slowly turning into the life-in-death and death-in-life statue – as if a kind of chromatic continuum exists between the physical world she inhabits and a mystical one that lies beyond.\nBelgian surrealist painter René Magritte’s famous anti-self-portrait, The Son of Man (1964), defies the logic of likenesses by refusing to let the viewer see the key features of the artist’s face by interposing between them and us the greenest of green apples the mind is capable of picturing. “Everything we see hides another thing, we always want to see what is hidden by what we see,” Magritte observed to an interviewer. “There is an interest in that which is hidden and which the visible does not show us. This interest can take the form of quite an intense feeling, a sort of conflict one might say, between the visible that is hidden and the visible that is present.”\nNo contemporary artist has understood more profoundly the rhythms of the visible that is not there and the visible that is, than the Irish-American abstract painter Sean Scully. The bold vertical columns of Scully’s The Bather (1983), inspired by Henri Matisse’s Bathers by a River, painted 70 years earlier, are stripped-down stand-ins for the already over-stylised bodies Scully recalls from Matisse’s work. Intensified by the boxy protrusions that complicate the carpentry of Scully’s work, which physically intrudes into the gallery-goer’s space, the ficus greens of Scully’s torso-wide trunks have succeeded in achieving an effect to which centuries of artists have only aspired: converting green from perishable colour into purest feeling.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to ourFacebookpage or message us onTwitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called “If You Only Read 6 Things This Week”.

    "content": "A hue now associated with innocence once had a murkier meaning: Kelly Grovier looks at the ways in which pink has represented violence and seduction.\nPink is a double-edged sword. While red is raucous and racy, and white is prim and pure, pink cuts both ways. Long before the word “pink” attached itself to the pretty pastel shade of delicate carnations, as we define the term today, the London underworld enlisted it for something rather less frilly or fragrant – to denote the act of stabbing someone with a sharp blade. “He pink’d his Dubblet”, so reads an entry for the word in a 17th-Century dictionary of street slang used by “Beggars, Shoplifters, Highwaymen, Foot-Pads and all other Clans of Cheats and Villains”, describing a lethal lunge through a man’s padded jacket, “He run him through”.\nMore like this:\n-The insect that painted Europe red\n-The toxic colour that comes from volcanoes\n-The racist message hidden in a masterpiece\nAt what point the unlikely linguistic slide was made from mortal piercing to mellow pigment, no one can say for sure. But the enticing hue itself, by whatever name it was known before the assignment of “pink” to the colour chart in the 18th Century, has kept culture blushing since antiquity. Now seductive, now innocent, pink is coquettish and coy, sultry and sly.\nRemove pink from the palette of art history and a teasing dimension to the story of image-making would be lost. Edgar Degas’s Pink Dancers would fall flat-footed and Pablo Picasso’s pivotal pink period wouldn’t rise to the occasion.\nA flesh in the pan\nA key moment in pink’s emergence as an essential element in the development of painting is the creation by the Early Renaissance Italian painter Fra Angelico in the middle of the 15th Century of his famous fresco in the Convent of San Marco in Florence, Italy, The Annunciation, which depicts the moment in the New Testament that the Virgin Mary is informed by the Archangel Gabriel that she will become the mother of Christ. Situated at the top of a staircase solemnly ascended daily by pious monks, Fra Angelico’s ground-breaking painting is one into which an observer’s spirit is summoned to levitate.\nCrucial to sparking that mystical lift-off in the fresco is the portrayal of the ethereal Archangel – who has himself mystically crossed planes of being to swoop into Mary’s material sphere. Never mind the polychromatic wings, what’s most surprising about Gabriel’s depiction is Fra Angelico’s decision to clad him in plush pleats of sumptuous pink.\nWe know from a contemporary artist’s handbook on how to concoct pigments (Cennino Ceninni’s Il libro dell'arte, published a few decades before Fra Angelico painted his fresco) that pink had been traditionally reserved primarily for the rendering of flesh. “Made from the loveliest and lightest sinopia that is found and is mixed and mulled with St. John’s white”, Cennini explains, “this pigment does you great credit if you use it for painting faces, hands and nudes on walls”.\nBy draping Gabriel in the lushest of pinks, Fra Angelico fleshes the Archangel out as a being of body and blood, breaking down the distinction between holy spirit and ephemeral flesh. Pink is the pivot that humanises heaven. No one would ever see the colour the same way again. In the ensuing centuries, artists would invoke pink as shorthand for the blurring of boundaries.\nBloom of Christ\nAs the focus of Renaissance master Raphael’s Madonna of the Pinks, a sprig of blushing carnations handed to the Virgin Mary by the infant Christ, may seem unremarkable enough at first glance. In fact it amounts to a kind of miraculous wrinkle in the fabric of time. According to religious tradition,dianthus(the Greek name for the plant, meaning “flower of God”), did not appear in the world until Mary wept at her son’s crucifixion.\nThe flower’s anachronistic appearance in Raphael’s scene, therefore, tinged with the future blood of the baby who holds it, mysteriously establishes a pink kink in the linear unfolding of the universe.\nOver time, pink would eventually blossom beyond the petals of its complex theologies to inflect a wider array of secular personality, all the while retaining its elusive allure and capacity to tease. By the 18th Century, pink was offering itself as the colour of choice for portraying high-profile mistresses, daring observers to deny its very legitimacy as a respectable hue.\nFamous portraits by the French Rococo portraitist Maurice Quentin de la Tour of Madame de Pompadour and by the English artist George Romney of his muse Emma, Lady Hamilton (later mistress of Lord Nelson), posing as a mythological maenad, reveal how decidedly deconsecrated the colour had become.\nLa Tour’s full-length pastel-pencil portrait of the official chief mistress to Louis XV of France, begun around 1748, is a rumbunctious jungle gym of superfluous pinks that spider across every inch and threaten to suffocate its subject. Here, pink is an energy that vibrates from the sitter to the secular subjects with which Pompadour has surrounded herself – music, astronomy, and literature.\nPorcelain pink\nA patron of the porcelain trade, Pompadour had famously inspired the minting by the Sevres porcelain factory of a new hue of pink, delicately bruised by dabs of blue and black. To Pompadour, pink was no longer a mere accessory but a partner in crime – an aspirational second skin into which she grew intellectually and emotionally. She became her colour.\nNo painting embodies pink’s gradual pendulum movement from the spiritual to the secular more vividly than the French artist Jean-Honoré Fragonard’s exuberant The Swing, painted around 1767, between La Tour’s and Romney’s works. Here, a fabulous flounce of flowing rose is frozen in mid swivel as the swinging girl, pillowed in pinkness, flicks loose a silk shoe, attracting the titillated attention of any number of camouflaged male gazes hiding in the bushes around her. We’re a long way from the pink whisper of angels now.\nIn more recent times, pink continues to be seized upon by artists keen to confound our expectations of what notes or message the floral pigment can confidently carry. Having established a formidable reputation in the middle of the 20th Century as a first-generation Abstract Expressionist, eschewing figurative subjects entirely in the 1950s, Canadian-born American artist Philip Guston reached for pink in a dramatic turn back to representational art in the late 1960s.\nBy then, the colour itself had undergone something of a commercial transformation in American retail culture, having begun the century as a shade more often associated with boys and masculinity than fairy princesses and little girls’ dolls. But by the time Guston began introducing a menacing cast of Ku Klux Klan-inspired cartoon goons, whose implausibly pale pink stubby hoods continue to menace popular imagination to this day, the colour had been re-commodified as delicate and feminine. Grabbing pink by the scruff for his unsettling scenes of a seedy Americana, Guston slaps Barbie across the chops.\nAt the same moment that Guston’s provocative pink was poking the art world in the eye, scientific studies were underway by Alexander Schauss, Director of the American Institute for Biosocial Research, to determine whether manipulations of the colour could help control the behaviour of subjects surrounded by it. The result of Schauss’s investigation was the concoction of the psychologically subtle shade now known as “Baker-Miller Pink”, after the Naval correctional institute in Seattle, Washington where the pigment was successfully tested on the walls of inmates’ cells and credited with a significant calming of aggressive urges.\nYet despite its ability to inspire docility, pink is still picking fights, challenging our perceptions to an aesthetic duel. Upon learning that the British artist Anish Kapoor had signed a contract giving him exclusive rights to a recently engineered colour known as Vantablack (the darkest shade ever devised), and the legal right to prohibit other artists from doing so, Kapoor’s younger contemporary Stuart Semple saw red.\nEmboldened by Kapoor’s black embargo, Semple began concocting a supremely-fluorescent pink paint he contends is the “pinkest pink” ever contemplated (“no one has ever seen a pinker pink”, he insists). As a poke in the eye of Kapoor, Semple has made his colour available at a small price to anyone in the world so long as they confirm that they are not Anish Kapoor nor friendly enough with Kapoor to share it with him. En garde, Kapoor. You’ve been pink’d.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to ourFacebookpage or message us onTwitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called “If You Only Read 6 Things This Week”.

    "content": "For centuries, the orange pigment was sourced from a toxic mineral. Kelly Grovier looks at a hue that alchemists believed was crucial to creating the Philosopher’s Stone – and which allows art to swivel between different states of being.\nExpunge orange from the history of art and the whole thing collapses. The sky above Edvard Munch’s The Scream falls down and the fire that ignites Frederic Leighton’s famous Flaming June flames out. Take away orange, and everything from the warm eternal glow of Egyptian tomb painting to the troubled stubble of Vincent van Gogh’s smouldering self-portraits vanishes. A savvy arbiter between resolute red and unyielding yellow, orange is a pigment that pivots. It’s a hinge of a hue that enables a work of art to swivel between contrary states of being – this world and another, life and death.\nOutside the frame of art history, orange has proved an unusually elastic symbol, blossoming into a spectrum of shapes and cultural meanings. Although the influential European royal House of Orange traces its name back further than the actual coining of the colour in the 1540s, its prominent son, William III (better known as William of Orange), quickly embraced the linguistic coincidence in the 1570s. His orange-white-and-blue rebel flag would become the forerunner of the modern tricolour of The Netherlands. From there orange took on the complexion of everything from Swiss fire engines to the suits worn by astronauts in the International Space Station. But it’s in the realms of art and aesthetics that the colour has fructified more soulfully.\nFrom antiquity to the end of the 19th Century, a volcanic mineral found in sulphurous fumaroles (great gashes in the Earth’s crust) was a significant source for the harvesting of orange pigment. The highly toxic orpiment, rich in lethal arsenic, ripens from mellow yellow into outrageous orange when subjected to the heat of a fire.\nConvinced that the luminous shimmer of orpiment (its name is a contraction of Latinaurum, meaning ‘gold’, andpigmentummeaning ‘colour’) must be a key ingredient in concocting the Philosopher’s Stone, alchemists for centuries risked exposure to the noxious substance. So did artists. To dabble in the occult of orange was to flirt with mortality and immortality in equal measure.\nA spark to a flame\nIntentionally or not, that ambiguous aura is irrepressible wherever orange is conjured in art. Take for example the French Rococo painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard’s portrait of a generic writer captured at a moment of intense vision: Inspiration, painted around 1769. The poet’s plush orange jacket – its vibrant rumples flickering like flares – threatens to engulf the allegorical subject of a poet whose imagination has just been ignited. The furrowed velour has become an outward reflection of the writer’s mind. This evaporative moment of reverie that illuminates the subject, as if from inside his soul, will either ensure his eternal fame as a celebrated bard or will set on fire his very being. Fashion him in any other colour than orange and the work’s flustering power would be utterly lost.\nNor is it possible to imagine Self-portrait with Halo and Snake, painted by the post-Impressionist Paul Gauguin more than a century after Fragonard’s canvas, soaked in any other colours than the two competing complexions of orange that dominate and divide its radiant surface into competing territories of piousness and malevolence. Created by Gauguin while living in the North-western French fishing village of Le Pouldu, the work portrays, in its upper half, a saintly indifference to worldly temptations, as symbolised by a dangling sprig of forbidden fruit. To make certain we don’t miss the unmissable point, the artist has crowned himself in this hemisphere of the work with an angelic halo. The lower half of the wood panel, however, reveals an uncontainable susceptibility to evil as the seductive snake from the Garden of Eden has the artist wrapped around his proverbial finger. Tying the work together tonally is a dramatic shift at its equator in shades of orange – not unlike orpiment itself, before and after its purifying baptism by fire.\nAnd so it goes, work by work, century after century: wherever the colour orange dictates the temperature of a work of art, we know we’ve arrived at a precarious hinterland between a universe we can see and a mysterious unknown we tentatively feel. How else can you characterise the realm in which the liquified face of Munch’s hero howls under a strange and estranging burnt-cinnamon sky in The Scream? How else can you describe the eternal space in which Henri Matisse’s iconic The Dance whirls apocalyptically on the edge of oblivion?\nCommissioned in 1909 by a wealthy Russian businessman to adorn the staircase of his mansion, at first glance The Dance might appear the apotheosis of rhythmic delight and synchronised levity. But the eerie apricot tinge of the five ecstatic nudes, who seem to have subsumed into their very being the armageddon orange of Munch’s work, is a tip-off that something more complex and perilous is at play. The two dancers who stretch the foreground of the work have lost their grip on each other’s hands, as the one closest to us begins slipping to the ground. Her left foot is already sliding out of view. Far from depicting untroubled joy, Matisse’s carefully choreographed masterpiece teeters on cosmic disaster. The very rotation of the world is left dangerously in doubt.\nAmber alert\nMunch and Matisse set the tone, as it were, for the portentous temperament of orange in modern and contemporary art. Throughout the 20th Century, the ominous refulgence of orange will find itself refracted variously in the works of everyone from Francis Bacon, where it sets the sinister scene for the disturbing Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion (1944), as well as Rene Magritte’s Art of Living (1967), where the colour inflates itself to popping point as a surreal cranium. The syncopated pigments and shudders of Rhythm, joy of life, painted in 1931, is characteristic of how crucial orange is to the work and imagination of the Ukrainian-born French artist Sonia Delauney, who once protested: “You know I don’t like orange”. Like it or not, orange is frequently the heat that holds together – while threatening to break apart – the visual music of her sinuous mosaics.\nAs crucial as orange has been to the story of art through the end of the last century, it has already dyed itself indelibly into the unfolding fabric of contemporary artistic consciousness. Among the most celebrated major works of the new millennium, The Gates, by Bulgarian artist Christo Yavacheff and French artist Jeanne-Claude (known together as Christo and Jeanne-Claude), colonised New York City’s Central Park in February 2005 with over 7,500 passageways – each flowing with orange nylon fabric. The lyrical succession of thresholds, which fostered a poetic sense of the endless comings and goings of life – birth and rebirth, mortality and eternity – could, on reflection, have only been draped in stirring saffron. To some, the colour echoes the robes of Buddhist monks. But to my mind, Christo and Jeanne-Claude (who passed away four years later) were rekindling a sacred flame, inviting those who would come to bask their weary souls in the transformative power of that most mystical of ancient tints: orange.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to ourFacebookpage or message us onTwitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called “If You Only Read 6 Things This Week”.

    "content": "Marcel Duchamp’s last painting has influenced artists for a century. Kelly Grovier looks at how it inspired the modern colour chart – and at its 17th-Century predecessor.\nThis year marks the centenary of one of the more curious milestones in modern cultural history – a landmark in image-making with intriguing echoes of a long-forgotten tome from the 17th Century. In 1918, the French avant-garde artist Marcel Duchamp picked up his brush after a four-year hiatus from painting and created a mysterious work that changed forever the way artists use and understand colour. After completing his painting, Duchamp put his brush back down again and, for the next 50 years (until his death in 1968), never painted another picture.\nMore like this:\n-When the Parthenon had dazzling colours\n-The insect that painted Europe red\n-The subversive power of the pipe\nThe work in question is awkwardly proportioned – over 3m (9.4ft) long, yet barely two-thirds of a metre tall – and was commissioned to hang above a bookcase in the library of the US collector and patron of the arts Katherine Dreier. At first glance, the canvas (which Duchamp eccentrically entitled T um’, a terse abbreviation of the tetchy French phrasetu m’ennuies, or ‘you bore me’) appears to do everything it can to be something other than a painting. Its surface is dominated by shadowy allusions to a series of controversial sculptures that Duchamp had recently been making – found objects such as a hat rack, a corkscrew, and a bicycle wheel – that he christened ‘readymades’.\nIn stark contrast to these large ghostly echoes of another artistic medium, a scatter of worldly debris is strewn across the painting: safety pins, a bolt, and a brush for cleaning bottles.According to Yale University, “Duchamp summarises different ways in which a work of art can suggest reality: as shadow, imitation, or actual object.” Stretching over this odd array of forms is a carefully-rendered cascade of colourful lozenge-shaped tiles that swoop vibrantly into the centre of the painting from the top left, like the tail of a mechanical polychromatic comet.\nAnyone who has ever shopped in a DIY store for domestic paint will recognise immediately this splay of colour tiles. But in 1918, pigment samples from commercial colour charts were still relatively cutting-edge in their retail trendiness, having only hit shop floors towards the end of the previous century. As yet unassigned to an actual object, these ‘readymade’ swatches of colour are at once both physical and theoretical; they haver between the real world of things waiting to be painted and a realm of pure mind in which those things can still be any colour.\nA pigment of our imagination\nIn a sense, this endless deck of dyes bursting into the middle of Duchamp’s painting is a Tarot of tincture, prescient of how things could eventually appear in an ideal world, not as they actually are. Though Duchamp’s tiles are merely a prophecy of hue, they seem somehow more real and urgent in his painting than the shadowy shapes of the hat stand, bicycle wheel, and corkscrew whose space they intersect cosmically, as if from another universe.\nThe years and decades that followed Duchamp’s final painting witnessed a succession of works by modern and contemporary artists that wrestle with and absorb the implications of his mischievous slicing of the mere idea of colour from the fact of physical form. Where proponents of colour theories of the 19th Century, such as those by the German Romantic Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and by the French chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul, are concerned with how colours are perceived by the human retina, the disciples of Duchamp became obsessed instead with colour as a commercialised concept – a pigment of their imagination.\nAt the same moment that descendants of post-Impressionism and the early pioneers of Expressionism were formulating quasi-scientific manifestos for how colour functions in the eyes of those who encounter their work, Duchamp was laying his new-fangled cards on the table: colour is an aspirational commodity – a property to be found, not an emotion to be felt.\nTitians of industry\nSuddenly, two philosophies of colour found themselves competing for artistic regard – one that understood it as a traditional tool of the craftsman to be soulfully mastered, the other that saw it as an artificial aspect of soullessly manufactured goods. That clash of sensibilities was perhaps most dramatically illustrated by the near-simultaneous appearance in 1963 of two very different kinds of publication. It was the year that the German-born American artist Josef Albers released his still-influential visual treatise, Interaction of Colour, which provides complex ruminations on the harmony of hues – a system that continues to be taught to this day. It is also the year that Pantone published its encyclopaedic compendium of subtle shades – a volume that appeared to prove the dominion of industry over the empire of conceivable colours.\nThe sway over artistic imagination in the 20th Century of the Pantone colour-matching system, and its precursors in the pigment charts distributed by companies such as DuPont, is impossible to overstate. Their influence can be traced in the works of generations of artists from Andy Warhol to Damien Hirst, Ellsworth Kelly to Gerhard Richter. But if Duchamp’s echelon of mechanical colour stretches prophetically forward in time to the obsessions of everyone from the Pop Artists to the YBAs, it also stretches back in history to the preoccupations of one of the most extraordinary, and extraordinarily neglected, books ever created.\nLong forgotten until its rediscovery in recent years by Medieval and Renaissance scholars,Klaer lightende Spiegel der Verfkonstis an 800-page handwritten and hand-illustrated volume from 1692 that seeks not only to illustrate every conceivable shade of watercolour possible, but to explain how to create them. An obsessive-compulsive recipe book for concocting the subtlest variations of tint, the book is the brainchild, according to the title page, of ‘A. Boogert’ – a Dutch hustler of hues about whom nothing else is known.\nBoogert’s book, which the inscrutable author says was intended to assist artists, came to the attention by accident of a Dutch Medievalist and blogger who was conducting research on the online databases of the Bibliothèque Méjanes in Aix-en-Provence, France, in 2014. Erik Kwakkel’s decision to feature the vibrant volume on his popular scholarly blog, and to provide links to a high-resolution scan ofthe entire book, helped propel the lexicon of luminosity into wider recognition than the single-surviving copy could ever have enjoyed in the author’s own lifetime.\nTo click through the digitised pages of the book and watch the hundreds of abutting tiles flick into a shuffled blur of calibrated colour is to find oneself enacting the geometric drama of Duchamp’s pivotal final painting. Speaking to each other across centuries, Boogert’s long-lost opus maximum and Duchamp’s underappreciated prophetic masterpiece reveal a perennial fascination with the mysterious disguises of life’s most elusive dimension: colour.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to ourFacebookpage or message us onTwitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called “If You Only Read 6 Things This Week”.

    "content": "Truly vibrant red was elusive for many years: until a mysterious dye was discovered in Mexico. Devon Van Houten Maldonado reveals how a crushed bug became a sign of wealth and status.\nAlthough scarlet is the colour of sin in the Old Testament, the ancient world’s elite was thirsty for red, a symbol of wealth and status. They spent fantastic sums searching for ever more vibrant hues, until Hernán Cortés and the conquistadors discovered an intoxicatingly saturated pigment in the great markets of Tenochtitlan, modern-day Mexico City. Made from the crushed-up cochineal insect, the mysterious dye launched Spain toward its eventual role as an economic superpower and became one of the New World’s primary exports, as a red craze descended on Europe.An exhibition at Mexico City’s Palacio de Bellas Artes museumreveals the far-reaching impact of the pigment through art history, from the renaissance to modernism.\nIn medieval and classical Europe, artisans and traders tripped over each other in search of durable saturated colors and – in turn – wealth, amid swathes of weak and watery fabrics. Dyers guilds guarded their secrets closely and performed seemingly magical feats of alchemy to fix colours to wool, silk and cotton. They used roots and resins to create satisfactory yellows, greens and blues. The murex snail was crushed into a dye to create imperial purple cloth worth more than its weight in gold. But truly vibrant red remained elusive.\nFor many years, the most common red in Europe came from the Ottoman Empire, where the ‘Turkey red’ process used the root of the rubia plant. European dyers tried desperately to reproduce the results from the East, but succeeded only partially, as the Ottoman process took months and involved a pestilent mix of cow dung, rancid olive oil and bullocks’ blood, according to Amy Butler Greenfield in her book,A Perfect Red.\nDyers also used Brazilwood, lac and lichens, but the resulting colours were usually underwhelming, and the processes often resulted in brownish or orange reds that faded quickly. For royalty and elite, St John’s Blood and Armenian red (dating back as far as the 8th Century BCE, according to Butler Greenfield), created the most vibrant saturated reds available in Europe until the 16th Century. But, made from different varieties of Porphyrophora root parasites, their production was laborious and availability was scarce, even at the highest prices.\nMesoamerican peoples in southern Mexico had started using the cochineal bug as early as 2000 BCE, long before the arrival of the conquistadors, according to Mexican textile expert Quetzalina Sanchez. Indigenous people in Puebla, Tlaxcala and Oaxaca had systems for breeding and engineering the cochineal bugs for ideal traits and the pigment was used to create paints for codices and murals, to dye cloth and feathers, and even as medicine.\nCochineal in the New World\nWhen the conquistadors arrived in Mexico City, the headquarters of the Aztec empire, the red colour was everywhere. Outlying villages paid dues to their Aztec rulers in kilos of cochineal and rolls of blood-red cloth. “Scarlet is the colour of blood and the grana from cochineal achieved that [...] the colour always had a meaning, sometimes magic other times religious,” Sanchez told the BBC.\nCortés immediately recognized the riches of Mexico, which he related in several letters to King Charles V. “I shall speak of some of the things I have seen, which although badly described, I know very well will cause such wonder that they will hardly be believed, because even we who see them here with our own eyes are unable to comprehend their reality,” wrote Cortés to the king. About the great marketplace of Tenochtitlan, which was “twice as large as that of Salamanca,\" he wrote, “They also sell skeins of different kinds of spun cotton in all colours, so that it seems quite like one of the silk markets of Granada, although it is on a greater scale; also as many different colours for painters as can be found in Spain and of as excellent hues.”\nFirst-hand accounts indicate that Cortés wasn’t overly smitten with cochineal, more concerned instead with plundering gold and silver. Back in Spain, the king was pressed to make ends meet and hold together his enormous dominion in relative peace, so, although he was at first unconvinced by the promise of America, he became fascinated by the exotic tales and saw in cochineal an opportunity to prop up the crown’s coffers. By 1523, cochineal pigment made its way back to Spain and caught the attention of the king who wrote to Cortés about exporting the dyestuff back to Europe, writes Butler.\n“Through absurd laws and decrees [the Spanish] monopolised the grana trade,” says Sanchez. “They obligated the indians to produce as much as possible.” The native Mesoamericans who specialised in the production of the pigment and weren’t killed by disease or slaughtered during the conquest were paid pennies on the dollar – while the Spaniards “profited enormously as intermediaries.”\nRed in art history\nDye from the cochineal bug was ten times as potent as St John’s Blood and produced 30 times more dye per ounce than Armenian red, according to Butler. So when European dyers began to experiment with the pigment, they were delighted by its potential. Most importantly, it was the brightest and most saturated red they had ever seen. By the middle of the 16th Century it was being used across Europe, and by the 1570s it had become one of the most profitable trades in Europe – growing from a meagre “50,000 pounds of cochineal in 1557 to over 150,000 pounds in 1574,” writes Butler.\nIn the Mexican Red exhibition at the Palacio de Bellas Artes, the introduction of cochineal red to the European palette is illustrated in baroque paintings from the beginning of the 17th Century, after the pigment was already a booming industry across Europe and the world. Works by baroque painters like Cristóbal de Villalpando and Luis Juárez, father of José Juárez, who worked their entire lives in Mexico (New Spain), hang alongside the Spanish-born Sebastián López de Arteaga and the likes of Peter Paul Rubens.\nLópez de Arteaga’s undated work The Incredulity of Saint Thomas pales in comparison to Caravaggio’s version of the same work, where St Thomas’s consternation and amazement is palpable in the skin of his furrowed forehead. But the red smock worn by Christ in López de Arteaga’s painting, denoting his holiness, absolutely pops off the canvas. Both artists employed cochineal, the introduction of which helped to establish the dramatic contrast that characterised the baroque style.\nA few steps away, a portrait of Isabella Brandt (1610) by Rubens shows the versatility of paint made from cochineal. The wall behind the woman is depicted in a deep, glowing red, from which she emerges within a slight aura of light. The bible in her hand was also rendered in exquisite detail from cochineal red in Rubens’ unmistakable mastery of his brush, which makes his subjects feel as alive as if they were in front of you.\nMoving forward toward modernism – it wasn’t until the middle of the 19th Century that cochineal was replaced by synthetic alternatives as the pre-eminent red dyestuff in the world – impressionist painters continued to make use of the heavenly red hues imported from Mexico. At the Palacio de Bellas Artes, works by Paul Gauguin, Auguste Renoir and Vincent van Gogh have all been analysed and tested positive for cochineal. Like Rubens, Renoir’s subjects seem to be alive on the canvas, but as an impressionist his portraits dissolved into energetic abstractions. Gauguin also used colour, especially red, to create playful accents, but neither compared to the saturation achieved by Van Gogh. His piece, The Bedroom (1888), on loan from the Art Institute of Chicago, puts a full stop on the exhibition with a single burning-hot spot of bright red.\nAfter synthetic pigments became popular, outside of Mexico, the red dye was mass-produced as industrial food colouring – its main use today. Yet while the newly independent Mexico no longer controlled the valuable monopoly on cochineal, it also got something back – the sacred red that had been plundered and proliferated by the Spanish. “In Europe, as has happened in many cases, the history of the original people of Mexico has mattered very little,” Sanchez told the BBC, but in Mexico “the colour continues to be associated with ancestral magic [and] protects those who wear attire dyed with cochineal.”\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to ourFacebookpage or message us onTwitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called “If You Only Read 6 Things This Week”.

    "content": "Released 40 years ago this month, Miloš Forman's best picture-winning Amadeus is often accused of historical inaccuracies – but the film's critics could be missing the point.\nWhen it premiered 40 years ago, Amadeus drew an initial wave of praise. A historical drama revolving around the rivalry between two composers, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri, it went on to win eight Oscars, including for best picture. Miloš Forman took home the best director prize, Peter Shaffer won for best adapted screenplay and both of the lead actors were nominated: F Murray Abraham, who played Salieri, beat Tom Hulce, who played Mozart.\nBut in the years that followed, a backlash grew over what some people saw as Amadeus's litany of historical errors. An article in The Guardiandeclaredthat \"the fart jokes can't conceal how laughably wrong this is\", and the BBCcommentedthat \"the film plays shamelessly fast and loose with historical fact\". Salieri, critics noted, was nopious bachelor(as attested by his wife, eight children and mistress), and it's after all an odd kind of hateful rivalry when the real Mozart entrusted the musical education of his own son to Salieri. As for Mozart's lewd humor, that cheeky insouciance was actuallycommonplacein middle-class Viennese society. Most egregiously of all, world-famous Mozart was not dumped in anunmarked pauper's grave. If this is a homage to history, thecomplaintgoes, it's akin to Emperor Joseph II fumbling ineptly on the pianoforte and bungling every other note.\nBut this kind of cavilling may be missing the point. Forman's aim for Amadeus can be seen as radically different from a typical biopic, and that was to use a fictionalised version of an epic clash between musical composers to allegorise the defining global rivalry of the mid-to-late 20th Century: the Cold War. Put simply, the film may have played fast and loose with 1784 because its real preoccupation was 1984.\nThe film opens in Vienna in 1823. Grizzled court composer Salieri howls through a bolted chamber door that he has murdered Mozart, then slashes his own throat. Days later, as he convalesces in an asylum, a priest arrives to hear his confession. It doesn't disappoint. Salieri recounts that as boy he made a vow of chastity to God as an expression of gratitude for, as he sees it, ushering in the providential death of his father to clear the path for his musical development.\nJump ahead some years, and Salieri is now an eminent composer in the court of Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones), where he eagerly awaits an introduction to musical prodigy Mozart. That eagerness curdles when he sees the man in the flesh – he turns out to be a lascivious vulgarian with an ear-splitting cackle. Convinced that God means to mock his own mediocrity, Salieri hurls a crucifix in the fire and vows retaliation. When Mozart's father dies, Salieri seizes on the misfortune with a dastardly stratagem: dupe Mozart into believing that his father has risen from the grave to commission him to write a requiem, then murder him and pass off the masterpiece as his own. Mozart, feverish and besotted with drink, dies, leaving Salieri addled with bitterness and destined for obscurity.\nThe premise wasn't original to Forman. Drawing inspiration from Alexander Pushkin's taut 1830 play Mozart and Salieri, Peter Shaffer wrote a highly stylised play called Amadeus, which premiered in London in 1979. Forman, sitting in on a preview, was entranced by the dramatic rivalry and convinced Shaffer to collaborate with him, not merely to adapt the play for the screen but to \"demolish the original, then totally reimagine it as a film\". Across four irascible monthscloisteredin a Connecticut farmhouse with Shaffer, Forman fundamentally rebuilt the narrative with a fresh palette of political resonances.\nThe casting process for the coveted roles of Mozart and Salieri rivaledGone with the Windin scope and behind-the-scenes intrigue, all of which played out over a year and involved meetings with literallythousands of actors. Kenneth Branagh was nearly victorious in landing Mozart, then got dropped from consideration when Forman pivoted to a US cast. Mark Hamillenduredgrueling hours of auditions, only to be told by Forman: \"No one is believing that the Luke Skywalker is the Mozart.\" Al Pacino lobbied hard for the part of Salieri, in competition with Mick Jagger, Burt Reynolds, Donald Sutherland and Sam Waterson. In the end, Forman eschewed splashy celebrities for Hulce and Abraham, only to have casting drama explode again when Meg Tilly, slated to play Mozart's wife, Constanze, broke her ankle playing football: she was replaced by Elizabeth Berridge a week before shooting was to commence. With the plot rebuilt and the cast in place, more than one rivalry was poised to come into focus.\nThe Czech-born Forman had been a galvanising force behind the Czechoslovakian New Wave film movement in the 1960s, reaching a climax with his 1967 film The Firemen's Ball, which satirised the absurd inefficiencies of Eastern European communism. The film was initially warmly received within the reformist milieu of the Prague Spring, but whenSoviet tanksrolled into Prague the following year and organised Czechoslovakia into the Eastern bloc, Forman, tarred as a \"traitor\" to the state, was forced to flee to the West and found refuge in the US.\nNearly all of Forman's film work thereafter would show glimmers of opposition to Soviet-style censorship, confinement, and concentrated power. His first success in the US, for example, 1975'sOne Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, depicted a mental health ward meting out cruelty and coercion to patients under the guise of benevolent care. Audiences barely needed to squint to see the asylum as gulag andNurse Ratchedas the embodiment of the drunk-on-power Soviet bureaucrat. Likewise, Forman's 1996 film, The People vs Larry Flynt, depicted thefounder of Hustler magazinesquaring off against censorship at the cost of being jailed, locked up at a psychiatric facility and paralysed by an assassin's bullet.\nThe Soviet allegory can certainly be applied to Amadeus. Perhaps Forman was less concerned with hewing to biographical facts as he was with presenting Mozart as a beleaguered type of ecstatic genius who, hostage to patronage, is stifled and finally crushed by the repressive apparatus of the state. Joseph II, absolute ruler of the Habsburg monarchy, is advised at court by a clutch of prudish sycophants who undermine Mozart's achievements and smear his reputation. Whatever its loose correspondence to the late-18th and early-19th Centuries, this critique can be read as a stab at the USSR – a debilitatingly centralised bureaucracy hostile to insurgent ideas and innovation. But Forman showed that Mozart would get the last laugh. By the events of 1823, Salieri's insipid, state-sponsored melodies have all been forgotten, while a few bars of Mozart draw immediate joy to the priest's face. In the free market of popular tastes, Salieri's mandated drivel has been suffocated by the triumph of genius.\nIn Forman's hands, the Habsburg Empire bears the hallmarks of Soviet power. The masquerade balls, with their bewildering swirl of masked identities, conjure the confusion and paranoia that proliferated under the Soviet system. Salieri's reluctant servant-spy (Cynthia Nixon) carries out covert surveillance, a nod to the 20th Century's KGB, which had thousands of its moles burrow into the private lives of artists and dissidents. Meanwhile, Salieri's heretical burning of the crucifix and war on God call to mind the ideological struggle between a Christian worldview and secular Soviet hubris. (After Abraham's mother – a pious Italian woman – saw the cross-burning scene, she browbeat her son so relentlessly that he blurted out what he now tells the BBC was a lie: \"I told her, 'mum, that was an extra – somebody else threw it in there!'\")\nAnd then there's the mass grave into which Mozart's corpse is dumped. This depiction does not fit the facts of what is known about his death, but it makes sense if read as an indictment of Soviet practices – the effacement of individual identity and literal mass murder.Grim excavationsof these pits continue to this day. Forman, whose own parents perished in Nazi concentration camps, understood the power of this imagery.\nJeff Smith, author of Film Criticism, the Cold War, and the Blacklist, tells the BBC that Mozart's struggle against the status quo tapped into Forman's own frustrations with Soviet censorship. \"The emperor's fatuous judgment about Mozart's opera–'too many notes'–is just the kind of accusation that was used as a cudgel used against avant-garde artists and thinkers to imply their work isn't pleasant or edifying to Soviet ears. Mozart's enraged incredulity in that scene must have mirrored Forman's own longstanding contempt for Soviet stagnation and repression.\"\nShooting took place in 1983 over a six-month period in Prague, which had the virtue of offering basilicas, palaces and cobblestone squares virtually unchanged since the late 18th Century. Even with Soviet power waning, however, Czechoslovakia remained part of the Eastern bloc and Forman was still persona non grata, so adealwas struck: the director would refrain from meeting with political dissidents, and the regime would allow friends of Forman to visit with their repatriated prodigal son.\nForman's own recollections from the shoot centred on the travails of Soviet interference. His landlady warned his phone is bugged. Informers lurked in every room. Two unmarked cars tailed him everywhere, which seemed redundant since his own driver was also a secret agent. In his autobiography, Turnaround, Forman is just shy of explicit about the degree to which themes of Soviet repression leaked into Amadeus. \"As it had to be in the socialist Prague,\" he wrote, \"the spirit of Franz Kafka presided over our production\".\nPerhaps even more telling is a story he recounts of negotiating with the general director of Czechoslovak film, Jiří Purš, who, as Forman recounted, wanted absolute assurance that the Communist Party would have nothing to fear: \"I assume that politically there is nothing in the script that they could hang their hats on?\" Forman's reply is a model of plausible deniability and acid irony: \"Look, it's about Mozart!\"\nMore like this:\n•The cinema classic that made Clint Eastwood a star\n•The real California scandal that led to Chinatown\n•The D-day film that changed how we see war\nF Murray Abraham felt the strain of coercive scrutiny as he was traveling back and forth to the United States to shoot his role in Scarface (1983) while Amadeus was in production in Prague.\nAbraham tells the BBC, \"At the end of every shooting day I had to cross the border to get to the airport in Vienna to return to Hollywood. At the checkpoint, the Czechoslovak Police would make us sit idle at the gate, just as a way to throw their weight around, make you know who's in charge. That sense of bullying and intimidation was everywhere, and even when the Czech people responded with subversive humor, the strain was palpable. We never forgot for a minute that we were under communist surveillance.\"\nThat tension between the US crew and Soviet agents finally burst out into the open on 4 July. The production was shooting an opera scene, and the crew arranged so that when Forman yelled \"action\" a US flag unfurled and the national anthem played in lieu of Mozart's music. Some 500 Czech extras burst forth into emotional song, in effect revealing their sympathies with the West. But not all of them.\nForman recalled, \"All stood up – except 30 men and women, panic on their face, looking at each other [asking] what they should do. They were the secret police, dispersed among the extras.\"\nAs Amadeus continues to be reassessed at its 40th anniversary, the significance of the Cold War looms ever larger. Paul Frazier, author of The Cold War on Film, tells the BBC that the film brilliantly tapped into a deep vein of Soviet envy: \"Salieri is the Soviet Lada trying to be a Ford Mustang. He can't be as great as Mozart, so he resorts to undermining and manipulating him. This too was the approach of the old USSR towards the West: rather than being better than the West, the Soviets resorted to undermining and discrediting the West at every turn.\"\nHistorian Nicholas J Cull echoes that analysis. \"Think of the Jonathan Swift line: 'When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him.' Whether it's the 1780s or 1980s, what you have is true genius facing off against mediocre, conniving bureaucrats. You see this same dynamic at play in a Cold War film like last summer'sOppenheimer, which in some ways is Amadeus with A-bombs. It makes sense that refugee film-makers like Forman and his creative team would be drawn to tell an allegory of communist mismanagement.\"\nNot everyone is sold on the idea that Amadeus wrestles with Soviet totalitarianism. Kevin Hagopian, a media studies professor at Penn State University, says there's a risk of allegorising everything as an unseen Soviet menace, which ends up making art a mere handmaid to politics.\n\"That ultimately becomes a depressingly narrow way to appreciate the dazzling beauty and emotional breadth of Mozart's music,\" Hagopian tells the BBC. Nevertheless, he adds, we can't ignore the political resonances.\n\"The allegorical space that satirical Czech film-makers like Forman opened up meant that audiences began to look for, even perhaps invent, allegorical political meaning,\" he says. \"All films could be read against the grain of a regime that lacked not only humanity but any sense of irony about itself. So if Amadeus wasn't really about Soviet-style tyranny, but audiences merely thought it was, well, I have a feeling that would be just fine with Miloš Forman.\"\nFor his part, Abraham is candid about what he believes are the more contemporary political stakes of the film, as he told the BBC in June. \"Think about how many Americans now idolise Putin. These autocrats are suddenly celebrated again. It's disheartening, truly demoralising, but if Amadeus can help us see our current predicament through fresh eyes, that shows you how powerfully its message still resonates.\"\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "From a 17th-Century Italian violin stolen from Japan to Drake's lost Blackberry in Mexico, here are musical lost and found mysteries that rival Sir Paul McCartney's.\nIn musical happy endings, last week, Sir Paul McCartney wasreunited with his bass guitarthat was stolen 51 years ago in London. The instrument, which McCartney purchased in 1961, was subsequently nabbed from a band van in 1972. Now, thanks to theLost Bass search project, the Beatle has been reunited with the bass, which had been until recently stashed in a Sussex attic. Both McCartney and Höfner, the instrument manufacturer, authenticated the found item upon its rediscovery, and a spokesperson for McCartney told BBC News he was \"incredibly grateful\" for the return of his lost guitar.\nMore like this:\nBut McCartney certainly isn't the only musician to lose a valuable piece of his kit – in fact, he's not even the only Beatle. And for non-Beatles-level musical acts, the loss of an instrument – or worse, an entire kit – can be devastating. The BBC previously reported on the theft of rock bandCemetery Sun's entire kitand van, as well as trioNoisy's stolen kit reappearingwith individual instruments and pieces of gear up for auction online weeks later.\nBassist Grant Emerson of Americana band Delta Rae recalls having around $10,000 (£7,937) of musical instruments stolen: \"We played at the Bitter End in New York City and parked our van down the street. When we came back to the van, the back door had been broken into, and all of our guitars were gone, plus a pedal board and a piece of the drummer's equipment. Probably four to five pieces of gear were stolen. It was a really terrible drive back to North Carolina.\" He notes that for most bands, the only recourse is fundraising: \"You just rely on your fans. You ask for help and donations, which isn't easy.\" And he urges all musicians to \"photograph the serial number of every instrument and piece of gear you own\".\nLost or stolen instruments over the years have kept musicians and fans alike searching for guitars, violins, and even an entire brass band. Here are a few more musical mysteries – some of which remain unsolved to this day.\nThe famous blues legend was known for riffs on his legendary guitar, a Gibson he named Lucille – in fact, King had multiple performance guitars named Lucille over the course of his career. The name was inspired by a lover’s quarrel King witnessed in 1949 (the woman arguing was named Lucille, and she left quite an impression on King). When this particular Lucille guitar was stolen, it was eventually found in a Las Vegas pawn shop byEric Dahl, a fellow musician who mistakenly purchased the guitar and later returned it to King. Dahl offered it without compensation and went on to write a book about King and his many guitars. The Gibson also ended up being one of the last instruments King played before his death in 2015, and it was subsequently sold at his estate auction for $280,000 (£222,286) in 2019.\nClapton's Gibson Les Paul guitar, named Beano, was stolen soon after his studio album Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton was released in 1966. Unlike King, Clapton hasn't been so lucky as to be reunited with his lost guitar – yet. But singer-songwriter JoeBonamassa has claimed he knows where it is: In 2016, Bonamassa gave an interview in which he said the guitar was in a private US collection, which spurred a 2018petitionto encourage Bonamassa to reveal more details. On theirYouTube channel, music aficionados Baxter and Jonathan of North Carolina-based Casino Guitars joked that they imagine a \"guitar illuminati\" trading in lost and rare instruments might not be pleased with what Bonamassa has already shared so far – and pondered whether he has a responsibility to help Clapton retrieve the stolen item if he does, in fact, know where it is.\nA violin made in 1675 by Nicolo Amati in Italy was stolen in 2005 from the home of Japanese violinist Takiko Omura, who had purchased the instrument in the United States many decades earlier. The violin, whichwas priced at nearly £300,000($377,895) in 2005 when it was taken, wasreportedly found in 2020in Parma, Italy, in the raid of a home of a suspected drug trafficker. Authorities in Italy and Japan worked together to return the instrument to its rightful owner.\nIt's difficult enough to find one lost guitar, let alone an entire brass band. In 2022, a famouslocal New Orleans \"second line\" brass band had all their equipment stolen from their vanduring the worst possible time for them – two weeks beforeNew Orleans Jazz Fest. Nearly $12,000 (£9,526) in musical instruments, including cymbals, drum sets, keyboards and amps, were stolen when the band's van disappeared from outside the home of a band member. The theft threatened to derail the Stooges' festival appearance that year, but the band is back on its feet, with ascheduled appearance on 28 April at this year's Jazz Fest.\nAs the BBC has previously reported, the violin prodigy Min Kym's Stradivarius was stolen in 2010 from a Pret a Manger restaurant. This wasno ordinary violinistand no ordinary violin: At just seven years old, Kym had earned a slot at the prestigious Purcell School of Music in the UK, and at age 11, she won first prize at the Premier Mozart International Competition. When presented with the opportunity to own a rare 1696 Stradivarius, \"Kym remortgaged her flat and bought the violin for £450,000 ($580,000). If this seems like an astronomical amount of money, it was in fact a steal in Stradivarius terms: the violin's actual worth was closer to £1.2m ($1.5m) and these instruments are so precious that their value only ever goes up,” reads the 2017 article about the crime. Although the stolen violin was eventuallyrecovered three years later, it wasnot returned to Kym, and her memoir, Gone: A Girl, A Violin, A Life Unstrung, tells the story of coping with a musical instrument being lost and found and then lost again.\nSir Paul wasn't even the only Beatle whose beloved instrument was absconded with: George Harrison's 1965 Rickenbacker guitar wasallegedly stolen in 1966. Rickenbacker CEO John Hall told Reverb that the guitar's mystery has been so longstanding because \"no one knows the exact serial number of the original guitar.\" The Rickenbacker team were, however, able to narrow the list down to five potential guitars based on shipment dates.\nHarrison also had his '57 Les Paul, Lucy – which was formerly owned by the Lovin' Spoonful's John Sebastian, Rick Derringer, and Eric Clapton – stolen. It was nabbed fromHarrison's homeduring a burglary in 1973 and then sold to a Los Angeles music store who, in turn, sold it to Mexican musician Miguel Ochoa, who declined to sell it back to Harrison at full price. Instead, Ochoa negotiated a trade with Harrison: Harrison got Lucy back, and Ochoa would get a 1958 Les Paul Standard and a Fender Precision bass.\nIn his 2009 song Say What's Real, produced by Kanye West, Drake revealed that he lost some of his best lyrics in Mexico: \"Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo/So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll,\" he raps, followed by an expletive-laden line that finishes the rhyme. For his genre of music, that Blackberry was his instrument, which heused to pen his songs. While it doesn't sound like it's ever been returned, Drake has probably upgraded his tech.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to ourFacebookpage or message us onTwitter."

    "content": "Many opera companies are working towards full sustainability, and Glyndebourne is among those aiming to be a force for good, according to a new documentary.\nA night at the opera is not typically equated with restraint, instead conjuring images of chandelier-filled theatres and arias performed in exquisite costumes against transportative stage sets. Yet, recent years have seen opera companies across the globe make a determined effort to operate more sustainably, implementing numerous strategies in a bid to reduce their carbon emissions and overall impact on the planet.\nMore like this:\n-How opera can be 'open to everyone'\n-The nation that is the 'land of song'\n-Gen Z and millennials' surprising obsession\nThis is, in part, the result of climate activists, who have increasingly targeted the arts and entertainment industries over the past few years with the aim of drawing greater attention to their cause. At the end of 2022, for instance, responding to mounting protests, the Royal Opera Housecut tieswith its long-time sponsor, the oil giant BP. Yet, it is also a response to the shifting expectations of audience members: according to aUK studyconducted in 2022, 77% of audience members now expect theatres to address the climate emergency in their work – and opera houses are no exception.\nThe pandemic, while posing innumerable difficulties for the live entertainment industry, also offered an important pause for reflection. It was during this time that a number of UK theatre-makers joined forces with sustainability experts to conceive theTheatre Green Book, a publication setting a common standard for sustainable theatre production, and providing guidance on how best to achieve it. Divided into three volumes – sustainable productions, sustainable buildings and sustainable operations – spanning the many facets of what it means to run a theatre, the acclaimed guide has already been widely implemented.\nA key collaborator in the creation of the Theatre Green Book was the historic East Sussex opera house Glyndebourne, renowned for its summer festival which draws thousands of opera lovers to the stately home's verdant grounds each year. Glyndebourne has been forging a path towards greater sustainability in opera for some time. \"Art, opera, nature [has always been] a core trinity for Glyndebourne,\" explains its archivist Phil Boot in a new BBC documentaryTake Me to The Opera: The Power of Glyndebourne.\nIn 2012, executive chairman Gus Christie oversaw the installation of a 67m (220ft)-tall wind turbine on a hill adjacent to the opera house, which between then and 2022 has generated the equivalent of 102% of the electricity used by the company in the same period. The turbine serves as an important statement of intent for Glyndebourne. Alison Tickell, the founder and chief executive of Julie's Bicycle, a non-profit organisation dedicated to mobilising the UK arts and culture sectors in a fight against climate change, says in the documentary: \"I know that many opera companies… don't have the luxury of space. But [the turbine] still remains a beacon for us all [demonstrating] that climate action really matters.\"\nGlyndebourne has innovated in sustainable practice in the years since. In 2021, it joined the globalRace to Zero, pledging to halve its direct carbon emissions by 2030, and to reach net zero by 2050. \"We are zero waste to landfill now, so any waste we have goes down to [an] incinerator, which provides power for local homes,\" Christie says of some of the measures he and his team have taken to achieve this. \"We compost all our garden waste, we recycle as much of our stage-set material, costumes, props [as we can]. We have about 32 electric vehicle charging points [for visitors] which are all charged from the wind turbine.\" They are drawing from their resources in other ways, too: by the end of this year, they predict, all water served at Glyndebourne will come from the property's own natural spring, while plants grown in their gardens are being used to produce dyes for the company's costumes. \"Rivers around the world are polluted by dyes a lot,\" says dye room supervisor Jenny Mercer in the documentary. \"This way everything goes back into the ground.\"\nClimate action\nGlyndebourne isn't the only opera company taking steps towards sustainability. It is now usual among major opera houses, from the English National Opera to Opéra National de Paris, to boast a dedicated webpage outlining their sustainability mission statements, including pledges to adhere to the UN sustainable development goals, facts and figures relating to their reduced energy consumption and carbon emissions, and details of their own planet-friendly solutions.\nThe rooftop of the Opéra Bastille, for example, is host to anurban farm, cultivated using agroecology, which also contributes to the thermal insulation of the building. This produces around a hundred weekly baskets of fruit and vegetables that are then sold to staff and local residents.\nThe Sydney Opera House – a longstanding champion of environmental consciousness that achieved carbon neutrality in 2018 – has installed an artificial reef alongside the iconic building's sea wall, encouraging marine biodiversity and supporting Sydney Harbour's native species. Most recently, the opera house was awarded a six-star performance rating by the Green Building Council of Australia, the highest possible ranking. This is no mean feat given that perhaps the biggest challenge facing opera is achieving energy efficiency within its decades-, if not centuries-old, buildings. Indeed, in 2021,a survey by the UK's Theatres Trustfound that it would cost more than £1bn ($1.2bn) to make the UK's theatre buildings sustainable.\nIn the meantime, many companies have been looking to achieve sustainability through new buildings, while doing what they can to reduce waste in their pre-existing spaces. The Royal Opera House's production workshop just outside London, built in 2015, is in the top 10% of sustainable non-domestic buildings in the UK. While Milan's storied opera house La Scala's new office is a zero-energy building, producing more energy than it consumes thanks to rooftop solar panels and an open-cycle geothermal system. La Scala has also cut its carbon emissions by more than  630 tonnes since 2010, according to a recentNew York Times article, having upgraded to LED and smart lighting.\nElsewhere, the Opéra de Lyon, Göteborg Opera and Tunis Opera are currently partnered on anew projectinvestigating how best to implement the circular economy of production materials, while Leeds' Opera North is soon to launch its first \"green season\", using shared set design across its three productions, recycled or second-hand costumes, and including a new \"eco-entertainment\" work titled Masque of Might.\nAs the Theatres Trust's study shows, there is still a long way to go, and a lot of money required, to make the changes necessary to safeguard the future of opera amid the ever-worsening climate crisis, but there appears to be no shortage of determination and imagination among opera houses in their quest to do so.\nTake Me to the Opera: The Power of Glyndebourne is on BBC News Channel and onBBC Reel\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to ourFacebookpage or message us onTwitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.

    "section": "arts",
    "summary": "Is the world of opera becoming more inclusive? A new documentary, featuring conductor Antonio Pappano, explores the mission to open up the art form to everyone.",
    "content": "Is the world of opera becoming more inclusive? A new documentary, featuring conductor Antonio Pappano, explores the mission to open up the art form to everyone.\nConductor Sir Antonio Pappano is renowned for being a warm-hearted \"people person\". But there's one thing that makes his blood run cold: when he hears opera being accused of being an art form that's only for a wealthy elite. \"I get very offended by people who say we're elitist,\" he says passionately in a new documentary. This is \"a misconception that totally distorts the image of opera,\" he adds. \"The fact of the matter is, it's harder to get into a football game in London than it is to get into the [Royal] Opera House.\"\nMore like this:\n-The nation that is 'the land of song'\n-Eight of the most stunning opera houses\n-Gen Z and millennials' surprising obsession\nThis allusion to the beautiful game is not a frivolous one. When Pappano  became music director at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden (ROH) in 2002, he spoke of his love for popular music by stars such as Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Oscar Peterson, Joni Mitchell, and for musicals. \"I like football too,\" he added. \"Does that mean you can't like opera?\"\nBack then Pappano was 42, and the youngest conductor to lead ROH's orchestra. Some 700 operas later –  with many productions of the French and Italian repertoires; a good part of the Russian; Wagner, Strauss and contemporary works – and he is the subject of A Time of Change, presented by Zeinab Badawi, and part of the BBC documentary seriesTake Me to the Opera.\nThe documentary follows him from his modest roots, as the son of Italian immigrant parents who came from southern Italy to the UK, who worked hard to make ends meet.  They passed on their strong work ethic to him, and he learnt how to work with singers from his vocal coach father, flourishing as a musical talent in the \"the family business\". A Time of Change goes on to trace a career that includes assisting classical pianist Daniel Barenboim, through to a recent high, conducting the King's coronation service in May, featuring solos byWelsh baritone Bryn Terfeland South African soprano Pretty Yende.\nThe main focus of the film, though, is Pappano's mission to open up opera to everyone. \"Opera shouldn't cater just to one audience, or be focused on just one corner of the repertoire,\" he says. \"It must be open to the interests of many different people.\" While he asserts that the ROH, like every big opera house, wants to entice young audiences, he does concede: \"I think you have to be honest and say, yes, but younger people can't afford very expensive tickets, can they?\"\nIt's true that the price of opera tickets can seem too high to be anything but a rare luxury for most, especially young people. Halley Bondy, writing on the arts websitePaste Magazine, describes herself as someone who has been to the opera many times \"for a millennial\". And although she loves opera – \"from the hyper-real grandness to the unbelievable talent, to the septuagenarian, fur-hatted audience\" – she finds it \"easy to see why places like The Met [Metropolitan Opera House in NYC] are ailing in sales; young people just don't go. It's too expensive, too arcane, too massive… The onus is on the opera houses to do a better job of catering to the young.\"\nBondy has only managed to attend so often by being treated by a \"ridiculously generous friend\" or chasing discounted tickets. \"Like everything else in the world, the opera is a lot of fun if you have gobs of money,\" she observes, but she concedes anyone could get in with the $25 [£19.40] rush tickets, student tickets or commercial offers – which make it \"affordable, if you just dig a little\".\nIn opera's defence, ticket prices are generally high because it is notoriously costly to produce. All the more reason, argued The Guardian's Charlotte Higgins in February, for adequate government funding. Discussing recentcuts to opera funding, she wrote: \"If you starve something, run it down constantly, gradually reduce the provision of it so that few can afford it, it becomes 'elitist'… And if opera in the form that its creators imagine it becomes for toffs, that is nothing to do with opera itself… [it is] precisely the result of neglect and underfunding\".\nPappano is also invested in bringing new blood to opera, via schemes like the ROH's  schools matinees, which offer young people low-cost tickets to opera productions. Also, its Youth Opera talent development programme gives children aged seven to 13 the chance to try its \"rigorous music and drama training\".\n\"We make sure there's a real variety of socio-economic backgrounds and ethnicities, and an even gender split,” says Tom Floyd, ROH senior opera manger, talking about its open recruitment system. Most of the young people who join them \"come from families who probably have had no real experience of opera,\" he says.\nOpera for all\nOver at English National Opera (ENO), the company has stayed true to its egalitarian roots of the late 19th-Century, when theatrical producer Lilian Baylis and music director Charles Corri shared a vision of it as a place for \"people's opera\". ENO has \"opera for all\" in its mission statement. It does not assume knowledge of opera; its website has  key figures of the organisation  explaining what opera is and how it's made; and  the site hints at how it skillfully reimagines crowd pleasers, like La Traviata (to be performed this October), in thrilling new ways, alongside daring new work, such as 7 Deaths of Maria Callas, by performance artist Marina Abramovich (November).\n\"We sing in English to be accessible to the widest possible audience,\" an ENO spokesperson tells BBC Culture. The company offers free tickets for under-21s; discounts for under 35s, and tickets from £10 for all. No surprise, then, that more than half its bookings last season were from opera first-timers.\nStill, in order to survive the cuts to Arts Council England (ACE) funding, the ENO will next yearmove its main basefrom the London Coliseum to outside the capital and in so doing will  qualify for £24m funding over three years.\nOpera must change, ACE chief executiveDarren Henley wrotein an article for The Guardian: \"A new generation is embracing opera and music presented in new ways: opera in car parks… in pubs, opera on your tablet\". In truth, most opera companies are not digital-age dodgers; they have presences on the popular digital platforms, while the hashtag #operaisopen invites new audiences to click through.\nStreaming services –  like Royal Opera Stream and Glyndebourne Encore – have dished up productions and events, both popular and esoteric, to reach a wider audience. And there's also opera at the cinema. At ROH, 2022/23 has been its biggest cinema season ever, with more than 1,300 cinemas worldwide having shown or showing 13 productions (opera and ballet), including Madam Butterfly, La Boheme and Aida. The latter, staged in May and June 2023, was conducted by Pappano.\nNurturing promising young talent – like soprano Masabane Cecilia Rangwanasha – is a passion of Pappano’s, and he's also a role model for young opera conductors, like Avishka Ederisinghe, who says that watching him talking on YouTube was what inspired him to explore the art form.\nAs he steps down from his music director roles – at the Academy of Santa Cecilia in Rome after 18 years, and at ROH next summer, after 22 years – Pappano is looking forward to change. He will not be hanging up the baton yet: he will succeed Simon Rattle to become chief conductor at the London Symphony Orchestra, his \"dream job\".\nHe describes how he grew up in a council flat that was just \"a four-minute walk to Westminster Abbey\"; and that rising from his humble background to conducting the coronation at that same abbey was \"not a bad gig\". Jokes aside, there is a message there that  he'd love to hand down to a younger generation: \"If you have a vision for what you want to achieve in life, that spark and… the energy and resilience to keep pushing when you know things will get tough, you can make it in any walk of life.\"\nTake me to the Opera: A Time of Change is on BBC News Channel andon BBC Reel\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to ourFacebookpage or message us onTwitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.

    "content": "Opera star Bryn Terfel emerged from an extraordinary cultural heritage and a nation renowned for its love of singing. \"It's the air that we breathe,\" he explains in a new documentary.\nSir Bryn Terfel is pondering a question: what is it about Wales and the Welsh that produces a nation of singers? \"I think it's the mountains, and the fresh sea air. And the language – that is very important,\" he says. \"Then there's the hymns… You know, we just love to sing – it's the air that we breathe.\"\nMore like this:\n-Eight of the most stunning opera houses\n-The extraordinary'lost'opera composer\n-Gen Z and millennials'surprising obsession\nThe Welsh bass-baritone is the subject ofPeak Performance, part of the BBC documentary series Take Me to the Opera. Presented by Zeinab Badawi, it follows Sir Bryn – as he has been known since his knighthood in 2017 – from his operatic debut with the Welsh National Opera in 1990, to singing at opera houses across the world, like London's Royal Opera House, where he is a regular star performer. En route, the documentary revisits his roots in rural Wales and looks at how he's nurturing the next generations of singing talent, as well as his invitation to sing at King Charles's coronation.\nSir Bryn is high on the list of great living Welsh opera singers, which also includes luminaries such as Dame Gwyneth Jones, Wynne Evans, Katherine Jenkins, and Aled Jones. (Added to which there are many popular non-opera Welsh singers, including Tom Jones, Shirley Bassey,Bonnie Tyler, Charlotte Church and Cerys Matthews.) But beyond these headline stars lies a whole nation renowned for its love of singing, especially choral. So where does this passion for song stem from?\nIn A History of Music and Singing in Wales, novelist and poet Wyn Griffith, who wrote extensively on Wales and Welsh culture, observed: \"If you find a score of Welsh people, in Wales or out of it, you will find a choir. They sing for their own delight, and they always sing in harmony. They sing as naturally and easily as they talk.\"\n\"Wales is known as a nation of music – the 'land of song',\" notes the Welsh National Opera (WNO). \"Often connected with male voice choirs, it is… recognised for its choral traditions which are rooted in the culture.\"\nChoral singing in Wales dates back to the 19th Century, and flourished with the Cymanafa Ganu (hymn singing) movement, at a chapel in Aberdare in 1859; it was rooted mainly in religious songs, though a steady body of secular songs were also produced. Soon after, a revival of traditional Welsh music began with the formation of the National Eisteddfod Society, a focus for the Welsh passion for singing and song. Any worthy list of classic Welsh songs might include Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau (O Land of My Fathers); My Little Welsh Home by William Sidney Gwynn Williams; and the love song Ar Lan y Mor (recorded by both Terfel and Jenkins). Or the rousing We'll Keep a Welcome (In the Hillsides).\nThe male voice choir, along with the harp, are two of the most popular signifiers of Welsh music. Professor Gareth Williamstraces the male voice choir's originsto the mid-19th Century industrial age: \"We are reminded of what Aneurin Bevan once said: 'Culture comes off the end of a pick',\" he writes, referring to Welsh coal miners. Choirs started in the 1920s, like Cwbach from the Cynon Valley, and Pendyrus, survive today. After a day's hard graft in a mine, says Williams, the joy and community found in singing with co-workers was \"an assertion of working-class male bonding and identity expressed through that most democratic and inexpensive instrument, the human voice\".\nThe Welsh Borough Chapel in Southwark, London, is host to Eschoir, a Welsh male choir of around 20 singers, aged 20 to 75. Singing together since 2009, they've performed at Buckingham Palace, 10 Downing Street, and the Six Nations rugby tournament. Eschoir founder and director Mike Williams, who grew up in south Wales, describes their appeal: \"There's a humility to it, as Welsh choirs stem back to the coal mines and chapels. Many people enjoy singing in the pub as much as singing in a concert. There is no pomp… it unites us and keeps us connected to our Welsh roots.\" And the Welsh take choirs very seriously, he adds.\nIn tandem with a passion for choral singing in Wales, there has been a rise in popularity of the Eisteddfod. These Welsh singing and recital competitions date back to the 12th Century and today are a platform for public singing, especially for younger singers. It was at local Eisteddfods that the young Bryn Terfel first stood out, winning singing competitions that would lead him to study at Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and to his first professional role in Cosi Fan Tutti at Welsh National Opera, soon after graduating in 1989.\nA unique cultural inheritance\nIn the documentary, Terfel recalls competing in Eisteddfods in his rural north Wales, and how his \"parents paid for a lot of petrol to drive me north, south, east and west to compete. They saw something in their son… the passion, how I loved singing. I think that drove them to encourage the singing within me.\" Eisteddfods are \"a wonderful shop window\", he says. One of his charitable initiatives is a scholarship to develop promising young performers coming up through Eisteddfods. Peak Performance visits one in Llanadog, near Swansea, as young singers of all genders, from the area and across Wales, prepare to get on stage and sing. \"This is where it all starts for us Welsh singers,\" says one teenage boy in the documentary. \"This is where we learn our craft.\" He believes when Welsh singers go to London to study, \"you can see the difference… they’ve got some sort of… confidence.\"\nCertainly, Terfel was swaddled in song and music from the cradle. Born in 1967 in rural north Wales, his father was a farmer, his mother a special needs teacher who used music therapy in her work. The whole family, including older relatives, sang together and in choirs. \"My grandfather, my great-grandfather, had the love of singing,\" he says. \"There was constant learning going on in the kitchen, words on the cabinets. A little bit of rivalry as well, which is quite healthy.\"\nEilir Owen Griffiths, a composer and Eisteddfod adjudicator, explains what he looks for in a great singer: \"It's how the voice resonates, and the way it works with text.\" He describes Terfil's voice as \"like a beautiful double bass\" – but it's not just the incredible sound he generates: \"It's also the control he has – he can sing the most delicate pianissimo as well. It's a unique voice, very special.\" That quality – and cultural diversity – was drawn on when Sir Bryn sang at the coronation of King Charles, who personally chose him to perform; he sang Coronation Kyrie, a first in the Welsh language at a coronation. \"You have the rehearsals in the rooms… Then you have your fittings, and all of a sudden you're in your costume and make-up.\" And you're onstage, he says, \"portraying a character. And that's when the fun reallydoesbegin!\"\nThe documentary joins Terfel as he goes through his repertoire for a week in March: as well as the Barber of Seville at the Royal Opera House, he sings the title role in Puccini's Gianni Schicchi at the Philharmonic Hall, Liverpool; then travels to a studio near Cardiff in Wales, to record an album of sea shanties – the likes of Drunken Sailor, and traditional folk songs like Fflat Huw Puw, \"about a sailor and his wonderful ship\".\nIt's a voice that continues to thrill audiences, whether in lead roles such as Mozart’s Don Giovanni at the Royal Opera House; or Tosca by Puccini at Paris Opera Bastille; or Verdi's Falstaff, at Grange Park Opera, Surrey. As well as big opera houses, he performs for new audiences in concert halls too. Gillian Moore is artistic director of the South Bank Centre, where in recent months he sang extracts from two of Wagner's great roles: \"The fact he's passing that on to young singers makes total sense… When he's on stage, you cannot take your eyes off him.\"\nReturning to that question of why the Welsh love to sing, Wyn Griffith suggests it's about an irrepressible spirit – and it's simply in the blood: \"Whether they meet in tens or in thousands, in a small country chapel or in a vast assembly… they sing freely… It is not necessary to organise singing in Wales: it happens on its own.\"\nTake me to the Opera: Peak Performance is on BBC News Channel on 10 June at 13.30 and alsoon BBC Reel\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to ourFacebookpage or message us onTwitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.

    "content": "A radical new wave of artists are sweeping the previously elite world of classical music – with a little help from Squid Game, Dark Academia and fashion. Daisy Woodward explores how classical got cool.\nIf asked to guess what under 25-year-olds are listening to, it's unlikely that many of us would land upon orchestral music. And yeta survey published in December 2022by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO) found that 74% of UK residents aged under 25 were likely to be tuning into just that at Christmas-time, compared with a mere 46% of people aged 55 or more. These figures reflect not only the RPO'sbroader findingthat under 35-year-olds are more likely to listen to orchestral music than their parents, but also the widespread surge in popularity of classical music in general, particularly among younger generations.\nMore like this:\n-The radical trend millennials love\n-The forgotten Soviet genius of music\n-Have film and TV got Gen Z all wrong?\nThere are plenty of reasons for this, from the playlist culture spawned by streaming platforms that make it easy for listeners to discover new artists and types of music to fit their mood, to the solace it provided during the pandemic, not to mention the profusion of classical music in pop culture hits like Squid Game. But perhaps highest on the list is the global wave of Gen Z and young millennial classical artists who are finding new ways to be seen and heard, and – just as vitally – new means of modernising what has long been branded music's most elite and stuffy genre.\nUnsurprisingly, social media has played a huge part in this, as a quick search of the popular TikTok hashtag \"classictok\" (currently at 53.8 million views) attests. There, as well as on Instagram, young classical artists have been making use of the digital realm's democratic potential to lift the heavy velvet curtains on their art form, presenting classical music and its storied history in ways that are accessible, unintimidating and, most importantly, fun.\nFor French violinistEsther Abrami– who has more than 250,000 followers on Instagram, more than 380,000 on TikTok, and was the first classical musician to be nominated in the Social Media Superstar category at the Global Awards – the journey to social media fame stemmed from a desire to share her passion more widely. \"I was studying at a top institution and most of the time I was practising for exams, so the whole joy of sharing was taken away. Then, at the very few concerts I did play, there was a very specific type of audience that wasn't very diverse,\" Abrami tells BBC Culture.\nShe noticed that a handful of classical musicians had taken to Instagram to broaden their own reach, and decided to do the same. \"I started posting a few things, and was stunned by the reaction that I got. Suddenly you have people from around the world listening to you and telling you it brightens their day to watch you playing the violin,\" she enthuses. \"It opened this door to a completely new world.\"\nNigerian-US baritone and lifelong hip-hop fanBabatunde Akinboboyeenjoyed a similarly swift and surprising rise to social media fame when he posted a video of himself singing Rossini's renowned aria Largo al factotum over the top of Kendrick Lamar's track Humble. \"I was in my car and I realised that the two pieces worked together musically, so I started singing on top of the beat,\" he tells BBC Culture. He documented the moment on his phone and posted the video on his personal Facebook account, guessing that his friends would enjoy it more than his opera peers. \"But I went to sleep, woke up the next morning, and it had expanded to my opera network, and far beyond that,\" he laughs, explaining that within two days, his self-dubbed brand of \"hip-hopera\" had caught the attention of The Ellen Show, America's Got Talent and Time magazine.\nBoth Abrami and Akinboboye came to classical music in their teens, late by conventional standards, and cultivated their passion for the genre independently. This remains a driving factor in their desire to reach new audiences, which they've achieved on an impressive scale, largely just by being themselves. \"I ended up becoming an opera influencer by sharing the parts of me I felt comfortable sharing, which is a lot,\" says Akinboboye, whose playful hip-hopera and opera videos and posts – taking viewers behind the scenes of a world still shrouded in mystery  – have garnered him some 688,000 TikTok followers. \"It's a lot about how I relate to opera; my musical background was from hip-hop, but I still found a relationship with opera and that resonated with people,\" he explains. \"Almost every day I get a different message saying, 'I went to my first opera today'. I think it's because they're seeing someone they feel comfortable or familiar with.\"\n'Complex and profound'\nAbrami, a similarly enthusiastic content creator, agrees: \"I think putting the face of somebody not so far away from them to the genre is a big thing. That's what I'm trying to do, to reach different types of people and create bridges, to show them that this music can really move you. It's complex and profound and yes, it might take a bit of time to understand but once you do, it's amazing.\"\nBritish concert pianistHarriet Stubbsis another avid proponent of classical music for modern audiences who has been finding her own ways of drawing in new listeners. During lockdown, the musician, who usually splits her time between London and New York, performed multiple20-minute concertsfrom her ground-floor flat in West Kensington, opening the windows and using an amplifier to reach listeners outside. \"I gave 250 concerts,\" Stubbs, who was awarded a British Empire Medal by the Queen for this mood-boosting act of service, tells BBC Culture. \"I did a range of repertoire from my upcoming album, and also things like All By Myself, which I chose ironically for that audience. And the thing is, people who thought they didn't care for classical music came back every day because of the power of that music.\"\nThe fusion of classical music with other genres is a major facet of Stubbs's practice and, indeed, that of many others among the new generation of classical artists (see also the React to the K YouTube channel, where classical artists frequently reimagine K-pop songs with ingenious results, or Kris Bowers' brilliant orchestral arrangements of modern pop songs for the much-buzzed-about Bridgerton soundtrack). Stubbs's innovative first album, Heaven & Hell: The Doors of Perception (2018), was inspired by William Blake and features musical icon Marianne Faithfull. \"I always wanted to tie rock'n'roll and classical music together and put them in the same space, supported by literature and philosophy and other disciplines,\" she explains, adding that her next album, which she's making with pianist and former Bowie collaborator Mike Garson, will be a \"Bowie meets Rachmaninoff\" affair.\nInterestingly, the current swell of enthusiasm for classical music has branched out to become as much of an aesthetic movement as it is a musical one. Digital microtrends Dark Academia and Light Academia – dedicated as they are to the romanticisation of a passion for art and knowledge through imagery – both make rousing use of classical music in order to create the desired ambience. Ascendant Polish countertenor Jakub Józef Orliński, meanwhile, uses atmosphericvisualsas a powerful means of contemporising the baroque experience. Depressed by the lack of funding for music video production in the classical realm, he drummed up private sponsorship to make a 21-minute movie to accompany his 2021 rendition of Vivaldi's Stabat Mater. The resulting film conjures a compelling and suitably brutal scenario for the haunting 18th-century hymn, whichThe New York Times describes as\"resembling a Polish remake of The Sopranos\".\n\"I'm really interested in storytelling. I always build an entire concept for my albums – the narrative, the photography, the videos,\" Orliński tells BBC Culture. \"I think now there is this whole new generation of people who really want to add to what classical music can be, to go beyond the singing and be challenged. You just have to know that the end product will be good, and that what you're doing will serve the story,\" he adds. This is certainly something Orliński has achieved in his own career: an accomplished sportsman and breakdancer, hewowed criticswith his 2022 Royal Opera House debut, which found him pole-dancing in a spangled dress as Didymus in Katie Mitchell's production of Handel's Theodora. Other recent projects have included recording baroque tracks for forthcoming video games which, he says, was \"an incredible experience\" and is something he's being asked to do more and more frequently, as the Metaverse beckons. \"Sometimes you need classical music to touch the strings of somebody's soul – a pop song won't work.\"\nClassical music's ongoing and often powerful intersection with pop culture is being foregrounded as part of the burgeoning interest in the genre, both inside and outside its famously guarded gates. The all-teen members of the UK'sNational Youth Orchestrahave just completed a mini tour that included a performance of Richard Strauss's Also Sprach Zarathustra, replete with its opening symphonic sunrise eternalised by Stanley Kubrick in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Last August saw the BBC Proms launch its first gaming-themed programme whereby the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra took on some of the best-loved songs in video game history. While the recent autumn/winter collection from Acne Studios' younger sub-label Face offered up one of the most direct sartorial tributes to classical music to date, presenting crew-neck sweaters, T-shirts and tote bags embellished with the faces of Handel, Mozart and Bach in celebration of \"the idea that a passion for classical music is the most left-field move imaginable for a modern-day teenager\".\nOrliński agrees that classical music has achieved an \"almost hipstery\" status of late. \"It's cool to go to the opera, to know something, and that's because there are a lot of young artists delivering music on the highest level, while making it very entertaining,\" he enthuses. There is, he observes, a revived interest in classical music personalities such as Maria Callas and Pavarotti, as well as \"people like Yuja Wang\" who are selling out concert halls, all of which he feels bodes well for the art form. \"We have a long way to go to grow as much as other genres of music, but we're moving forward.\" Akinboboye, too, is tentatively hopeful. \"I think opera is definitely being a lot more bold, and I hope that it continues because I think we can catch up,\" he concludes. \"[Classical music needs to] be brave, to do the scary thing. And it'll work out, because audiences are ready.\"\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to ourFacebookpage or message us onTwitter.\nAnd if you liked this story,sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.

Now he brings his son, Sandy.\n\"I travel this distance every week because Sheena is one of a kind, her classes are inspirational and her teaching style is very exciting,\" he said.\nIan contacted the BBC throughYour Voice, Your BBC Newsto suggest we tell Sheena's story.\n\"There is nobody else who teaches quite like her,\" Ian added.\n\"Her classes are notoriously tough and rewarding.\n\"It's going to be quite a shock not to have her anymore but I will hear her corrections in my head and her saying, 'Where's your face? Where's the join? Where's the excitement?' every time I do other classes in the future.\"\nIan's son, Sandy, added: \"I can't tell you how much I will miss the classes, they are the best I have ever been to and unlike anything else.\n\"She doesn't let us away with anything, she notices everything, and she knows what you can aim for.\n\"I'm very sad she's retiring because you don't find many classes like these anymore.\"\nSheena said she decided to retire after worrying she might not be able to remain at her peak.\nBut she is not planning to have a rest.\n\"There is the garden and my house to tidy up,\" she said.\n\"I think I ought to make it easier for anybody who has to sort it out after I go.\"\nAnother pupil, data scientist Ryan Mcmanus, said it was the end of an era.\nThe 34-year-old, who travels more than 100 miles every week for the class, said: \"It's the highlight of my every week to come along and have a great time learning how to do things and getting corrections.\n\"I have been to other classes and what I like about Sheena is she is very insistent on the fundamentals: on correct placement, correct posture, on correct technique.\n\"I've seen a vast improvement in me and it's entirely down to her correctness, which I really appreciate coming from a scientific background myself.\n\"I had tears in my eyes when the class ended, I'm so sad and I sincerely doubt we will be able to find anyone like her again.\"\nTracy Hawkes, a ballet dancer who owns the dance studio in St Stephen Street where Sheen's classes are held, said the teacher had left a wonderful legacy.\n\"She's certainly one of the grande dames in Scotland,\" she said.\n\"To have someone who has been through decades of change in style and methods of teaching but has continued to have been such a font of all knowledge and experience, to have someone who is nearly 90 still doing that is just amazing.\n\"I've been so proud to have her here at the studio and it's a very sad day now she's retiring.\"\nSome of Sheena's pupils have gone on to the Royal Ballet, International Ballet and the British Ballet.\n\"One of my former pupils is about to move to the Scottish Ballet and when he heard I was retiring he was on the phone saying he wants private lessons, I'll get you tickets to come see me dance if you just give me some private lessons,\" Sheena said.\n\"So, it's meant to be the end - but we'll see.\""

    "content": "Esoteric and pioneering, the paintings of a lesser-known Pre-Raphaelite, Evelyn De Morgan, explored the trauma and meaning of war – and prefigured current fantasy art.\nOn a rocky beach that glows red with lava, smoke-breathing dragons surround wretched-looking prisoners beseeching an angel to deliver them from suffering. The oil painting Death of the Dragon by Evelyn De Morgan looks at first like a scene from the New Testament's apocalyptic Book of Revelation. But, painted between 1914 and 1918, it's also something more personal and critical: an allegory for the misery and bondage of World War One, and the confrontation between good and evil.\nThe spectacular painting, measuring more than a metre high, is one of the highlights of a new exhibition,Evelyn De Morgan: The Modern Painter in Victorian London, at London's Guildhall Art Gallery, home to the City of London Corporation's art collection. On display are rarely seen works from theDe Morgan Foundation, as well as twonewly-restored paintingsand two recreations, completed just last year, of works lost in an art warehouse fire in 1991.\nThe show coincides with the reopening of the De Morgan Museum in Barnsley, Yorkshire, following an extensive roof renovation, and responds to arising interestin this lesser-known artist. She has tended to be eclipsed by her husband William – a ceramicist and writer, who had worked early in his career with the textile designerWilliam Morris– and the famous men in their circle: her uncle and art teacher, John Roddam Spencer Stanhope, for example, and the painters William Holman Hunt andDante Gabriel Rossetti. Much of what we know about De Morgan today comes from her sister Wilhelmina, who set up the De Morgan Foundation, but even she saw fit to publish the couple's posthumous biography under the title William De Morgan and his Wife.\nYet, Evelyn De Morgan more than deserves the art world's belated acclaim. A Slade graduate, who was working at the tail end of the Pre-Raphaelite movement, she took the arguably twee or overly sentimental genre into new territory, creating tableaux that were unusually visionary and energetic. The women she portrayed were less passive than thosedepicted by her contemporaries, and featured as symbols of agency rather than objects of the male gaze. Instead of a drowned body floating down the river, as in Sir John Everett Millais'Ophelia, or figures whose main currency wastheir looks, we meet a skilledsorceress creating magical potionsandflying superheroineswho can cast rain, thunder and lightning from their fingers.\nThese goddess-like figures show the influence of the classical art that De Morgan had studied. Immaculately executed works such asBoreas and Oreithyia(1896) reveal her interest in mythology and her mastery of the human form, reminiscent of Michelangelo.\nIn Death of the Dragon, in terms of composition, it's easy to see the influence of Sandro Botticelli'sThe Birth of Venus(1483–1485), which De Morgan had visited in Florence. If De Morgan's haloed angel echoes this idea of rebirth − reflecting the artist's belief in a spiritual afterlife − then the winged beasts are its counterpart, Death, always biting at the heels of the people and threatening to overcome them. Elsewhere in her work, Death takes alternative forms: adark angel bearing a scythe,sea monstersor – more obliquely –a sand timer. It's a symbolism that speaks to life's transience, and acquires additional poignancy in her later work, conveying the collective trauma of living through a World War that claimed close to a million British lives.\n\"During the First World War they [the De Morgans] were in London, so they would have been directly affected,\" Jean McMeakin, Chair of the Board of Trustees of the De Morgan Foundation, tells the BBC. \"Death was real for them in a way that perhaps we've largely forgotten these days,\" she points out. \"Members of William's family died from tuberculosis, and his own health was often quite poor. Death was, in a way, always present in the background.\"\nMore like this:\n•Why this iconic 1839 painting is not what it seems\n•The surprising story of Van Gogh's guardian angel\n•Nine striking, rare photos of 19th-Century America\nDe Morgan was a pacifist and her art became a form of activism. InOur Lady of Peace(1907), a response to the Boer Wars, a knight pleads for protection and peace, while inThe Poor Man who Saved the City(1901), wisdom and diplomacy are advocated as alternatives to military intervention. Later, inThe Red Cross(1914-16), angels carry the crucified Christ over a withered landscape pierced by Belgian war graves – a suggestion, perhaps, that the Christian faith is at odds with the brutality of war, but offers us hope of redemption. \"You must never praise war,\" De Morgan declared in The Result of an Experiment (1909), a book of\"automatic writing\"co-authored with her husband. \"The Devil invented it, and you can have no conception of its horrors.\"\nThe idea of the forces of good and evil acting upon ordinary people was pervasive at this time. \"Spiritualism was quite popular,\" asserts McMeakin, citing the author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle – the creator of Sherlock Holmes – as one of its most famous adherents. Other-worldly beliefs, she says, were \"probably the result of the turmoil, the massive changes happening in society leading up to the turn of the century, plus a period of many wars, which would have had an impact on their view of the world\". Doubtless, De Morgan was also influenced by her mother-in-law, Sophia, a well-known spiritualist and medium. With so many lives lost, it was no doubt tempting to believe that you could reconnect with the departed.\nFor De Morgan, materialism was in opposition to spirituality, and many of her works conflate the pursuit of wealth with death. Crowns, as worn by the winged serpents in Death of the Dragon, are a repeated motif denoting greed and miserliness. InEarthbound(1897), an avaricious king in a gold cloak patterned with coins is about to be overwhelmed by the angel of death, while inThe Barred Gate(c.1910-1914), a similar figure is denied entry to Heaven.\nWith the future so uncertain, De Morgan places the importance of spiritual fulfilment and happiness at the centre of much of her work. InBlindness and Cupidity Chasing Joy from the City(1897), for example, \"Cupidity\" is personified as a crowned figure clutching treasures who is driving away \"Joy\" in the form of an angel. Here, as in Death of the Dragon, the central characters are chained, suggesting trapped souls.\nInThe Prisoner(1907-1908), the barred window and a woman's chained wrists make captivity a metaphor for gender inequality, hinting at the De Morgans' support foruniversal suffrage(Evelyn was a signatory of at least two important petitions, while her husband was vice-president of the Men's League for Women's Suffrage). The theme recurs inLuna(1885), where the rope-bound body of a moon goddess, a mythological figure of feminine power, functions as a metaphor for a woman's struggle to influence her own destiny.\nChristened \"Mary\", Evelyn later adopted her then-gender-neutral middle name, as women's art was not taken seriously. \"She wanted to be considered on the same level as her male peers,\" says McMeakin. \"We can assume a huge degree of self-possession and determination in her desire to become a professional artist,\" she adds, making the point that even De Morgan's mother opposed her career choice.\nTechnically, De Morgan was also a pioneer. She experimented with burnishing and rubbing gold pigment into her works to add depth and interest, and explored new painting techniques invented by her husband, made by grinding colours with glycerine and spirit. Stylistically, she was also ahead of her time. The unconventional use of pinks and purples, and the bold rings of rainbow-coloured light, prefigure thepsychedelic painting stylesof the 1970s, while her terrifying monsters would not look out of place incontemporary fantasy art.\nWhile art history has tended to paint women as virgin mothers, objects of beauty or temptresses, De Morgan's specifically female perspective recasts them as figures of hope that augur an alternative, brighter future. InLux in Tenebris(light in darkness) (1895), for example, the female figure holds an olive branch in her right hand, offering a pathway to peace. In Death of the Dragon, the angel is surrounded by a magnificent rainbow: a symbol (along with the sky) of joy that denotes spiritual fulfilment and freedom, as well as the promise of an afterlife.\nIt's a mistake to think of works such as Death of the Dragon as \"completely bleak\", argues McMeakin, noting that \"often with [her] apocalyptic scenes, there is a glimmer of hope, or a part of the painting that is calm\". In many ways, Death of the Dragon is optimistic, expressing a sense that the war – the metaphorical dragon – is nearing its end, and that good can overcome evil. In this existential battle, De Morgan saw a place for her work. When she was aged  just 17, she chastised herself for not painting enough. \"Art is eternal, but life is short,\" she wrote in her diary. \"I will make up for it now, I have not a moment to lose.\"\nEvelyn De Morgan: The Modern Painter in Victorian Londonis at the Guildhall Art Gallery, London until 4 January 2026.\nIf you liked this storysign up for The Essential List newsletter, a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Culture stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,X, andInstagram"

    "summary": "The McFly star says he is so lucky and honoured to have written the music and lyrics for the new show.",
    "content": "McFly star Tom Fletcher has said he felt \"overwhelming excitement\" working on the new Paddington stage musical, which producers have confirmed will open in November.\nThe singer-songwriter said he hoped the music and lyrics he has written for the show would \"do Paddington proud\", adding that the musical numbers are \"my favourite songs I've ever written\".\nThe show will open at the Savoy Theatre in the West End on 1 November, and follow Paddington as he arrives from Peru seeking a new home in London.\nThe musical, which has been in development for five years, is based on Michael Bond's original novels and follows the hugely successful recent film series.\nSpeaking about the show for the first time, Fletcher told BBC News he felt \"so honoured and lucky\" to be working on the project, which he said would reflect \"all of the fun, warmth and heart that the books and movies have captured so brilliantly\".\n\"There is something so magical about seeing Paddington step out on to the stage, and seeing him... I was about to say in the flesh, but I guess in the fur is more accurate,\" he joked.\nFletcher is best-known as the founding member of pop band McFly, whose hits include All About You, Obviously and Star Girl, and is also a successful children's author.\nHe was first approached about Paddington around the time of the first Covid lockdown in early 2020, and workshopped the project with scriptwriter Jessica Swale, director Luke Sheppard and the producers before the showwas formally announced in 2023.\nWith the musical now almost ready to launch, Swale told BBC News it would feature \"lots of juicy new material\".\n\"We're bringing a lot of new flavours to the table, but of course we're all in love with the original material, so we've been faithful to our cast of characters,\" she said.\n\"Of course the Browns are part of it, and familiar faces like Mr Gruber and Mr Curry, but there are a lot of new people as well. We've been very inspired by the books and the films but we like to think we're covering new territory.\"\nBond's first book in the series, A Bear Called Paddington, was published in 1958.\nThe author went on to write 29 Paddington books in total, the final one being Paddington at St Paul's, which was published posthumously in 2018. The stories have sold more than 35 million copies worldwide.\nFletcher said he relished the opportunity to find what \"the musical language\" of Paddington was. \"Having something that everybody knows but no-one's heard what it sounds like yet is a really exciting thing to be able to work on,\" he explained.\nHe recalled that, when producer Eliza Lumley first called him about the project, he not only immediately replied with \"a very fast 'yes please'\", but began writing music for the show right away.\n\"While I was still on the phone to her, I had the idea for a song, so I went and wrote my first song for it that night, instantly after getting off the phone, and that song is still in the musical now.\"\nHe reflected: \"My instant reaction wasn't to be intimidated, it was to be excited and just so inspired by these stories and films that I already knew, I just jumped straight at my piano and started writing.\"\nThe three film adaptations of Paddington, featuring the voice of Ben Whishaw, have been a huge success at the box office since the first was released in 2014.\nIn recent years, London has seen pop group Abba represented by virtual avatars on stage, while some animated film characters have been depicted using more traditional puppeteering methods, such as snowman Olaf in the stage adaptation of Frozen.\nIt has not yet been revealed what approach producers will take to representing Paddington in the theatre.\n\"I don't know what you're talking about, he's a bear!\" joked Swale. \"He's travelling from Peru to be a special part of our show!\"\nShe continued: \"I can't give away our secrets. One of the things I'm most excited about for this show is the character of Paddington.\"\nSwale credits producers Lumley and Sonia Friedman for \"really experimenting with every possible way that we could tell the bear's story in the best way, and the magic that they've found in how they do it”, adding: “Every single time I see Paddington for the first time, it makes me cry.\n\"I think he's completely magic, and to me he's very real. But I don't think audiences will be disappointed. It's a wonderful, theatrical version of how to tell this story.\"\nAs for the character himself, Swale noted the musical \"also reveals the spirit and the politics of Paddington\".\n\"For example, Paddington is a refugee, so we want to honour the fact that he is somebody who migrates to the UK and doesn't have a home, and make sure we are conscious of the experience of who he represents.\"\nBetween now and the show's opening in November, Fletcher said the team would be \"fine-tuning for as long as we can, and making sure that we get it absolutely right\".\nHe added: \"I really hope that I've done everyone who loves Paddington justice... This is so different to anything I've ever done before. I feel like this show is so ready to be out in the world, it's the most special thing I've ever been a part of in my whole life.\"\nThe 39-year-old will be on tour with McFly and Busted when the musical opens in November, \"so I'll be going from touring with the band and then rushing back to London to fit it all in\", he explained.\n\"It's a slightly hectic schedule, but we'll make it work somehow. I might get confused and start singing Paddington songs on stage with McFly.\"\nMost important, of course, is the question of whether or not Paddington's favourite food will feature in the stage adaptation.\n\"You can rest easy,\" laughed Swale. \"Marmalade features not only in the book and the lyrics, but physically on stage in a spectacular way.\""

    "content": "As Radiohead and the RSC launch an innovative reinterpretation of Hamlet, a visit to the play's setting in Denmark brings a new dimension to the tragedy.\nThere's a cold wind blowing from the Øresund Sound as I stand on a platform in front of Kronborg Castle in Helsingør, Denmark, looking out to Sweden. At one end of the platform, a pillar-box red guard post stands beside a row of impressive cannons facing the strait. I'm not here for the view though: I'm looking for ghosts.\nThis windy spot is the exact location for the opening scene of Hamlet, Shakespeare's best-known tragedy. Here, two guards, Francisco and Bernardo, switch posts in the middle of the night and speak of the ghost of Hamlet's father. The castle behind me, a grand Renaissance pile built in 1574 complete with fairytale turrets, a moat and a grand banqueting hall, is where the rest of the lurid drama unfolds.\nThis year, the Royal Shakespeare Company is presenting no fewer than three variations on the story: a radical adaptation using Radiohead's album Hail to the Thief as its score (from 27 April);Fat Ham, a comic tragedy that transplants Hamlet's story into the Deep South (from 15 August); and a traditional take inRupert Goold's productionstarring Luke Thallon (from 8 February). For context, the last time the RSC staged Hamlet was back in 2006.\n\"There's something in the air right now saying that the play has resonance,\" says Tamara Harvey, co-artistic director at the RSC, noting that all three producers had approached the RSC to stage their productions in the same year.\nAs a play that deals with themes of generational differences and changing world orders, not to mention the sense that \"there's something rotten in the state of Denmark\" – the idea that society's foundations no longer feel secure – it's hard to miss its appeal.\nToday, nothing looks rotten in Helsingør – the modern-day name for Shakespeare's town of Elsinore. The sky is blue and the sun is glinting off a gold flag flying at the top of one of the turrets. I'm on a tour with castle host Louise Older Steffensen to uncover Kronborg's Hamlet connections. Our feet echo as we walk around the stone corridors and into the grand ballroom with its chequerboard floor and soaring wooden ceiling, as she tells me there is no evidence that Shakespeare ever visited Kronborg – but he certainly knew it well.\n\"We have contracts that tell us that Shakespeare's colleagues visited the castle,\" she says. \"We know that the actors Thomas Pope, George Bryan and William Kempe were here for a season, performing plays for the Danish king. When they returned to England, they set up the Lord Chamberlain's Men, Shakespeare's company.\"\nThey may have brought back tales of what happened within its walls. A distinctive celebration is mentioned in the play: a toast followed by the bang of a kettle drum, a trumpet, and a cannon – and it comes from a tradition followed in the castle at that time.\nIn a dimly lit room next to the ballroom, the tapestries from that era are on display, their gilded threads depicting mythologised kings. Long curtains hang around the queen's bedchamber and around the castle, softening the sandstone walls, dampening sound and making it a fraction warmer – as well as providing opportunities for dramatic intrigue.\nVisiting the castle feels like being immersed in the play, walking down the large gallery where the silk dresses of the ladies-in-waiting would have rustled into its beautifully preserved church. It's as if the play itself has come to life, and the castle plays up to that theatricality. In the summer,special toursinvite guests to participate in Hamlet-inspired murder mystery-style tours, and in the autumn, Hallowe'en tours take place in the creepy basements. Nobody, to date, has seen the ghost of Hamlet's father – but there have been other ghostly sightings, according to Steffensen and assorted castle guides.\nMore clues about the importance of this castle to Shakespeare emerge as Steffensen gives me a history lesson. James I married Denmark's teenage princess, Anne, in 1589. When Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603 and King James ascended to the throne, England had a Danish queen.\n\"The first quarto – written very early in 1603 – is set in Denmark,\" said Steffensen, \"but there are no specific locations in it. After Anne becomes Queen of England, we get references to the castle itself.\"\nKing James became the patron of Shakespeare's company and their name changed from \"The Lord Chamberlain's Men\" to \"The King's Men\" in 1603. Queen Anne's castle in Denmark became an important location for the royal family and thus gained a starring role in the play.\nWe climb to the top of the cannon tower, a large flat space in a corner of the castle. Views reach across the moat to the yellow barracks buildings around it and to the town beyond. It's in one of these barracks buildings, the former infirmary that is now the headquarters of the town's Shakespeare Festival, where I find out more about the legacy of Hamlet in Helsingør.\nLars Romann Engel, CEO and artistic director ofHamletScenen, the castle's professional theatre body, welcomes me into a hallway-cum-gallery of Hamlet actors through the decades. In a who's who of Hamlets, black and white headshots of Jude Law, Kenneth Branagh, Sir John Gielgud, Derek Jacobi, David Tennant, Richard Burton and Christopher Plummer cover the walls and stairwell.\nHamlet played a part in reinventing this town into a cultural hub after its shipbuilding industry collapsed in the 1980s, as the municipality devised a way to create a producing theatre at the Unesco-listed castle. Engel set up the town'sShakespeare festival, which takes place at the castle every August, showing adaptations of Hamlet in many guises; previous shows have included Spaghetti Western versions, dark German variants by experimental theatreSchaubüneand a sell-out staging starring Jude Law.\nAs well as Hamlet, the festival typically also produces a lighter Shakespeare work, often with music and other events. Both plays are performed in the open air with the castle as a backdrop; tickets book out a long way in advance and the audience typically shows up with a picnic.\nMore like this:\n•Nordhavn: The Danish 'city' that's been designed for an easy life\n•Denmark's surf town where old-school fishermen and surfers live in harmony\n•Copenhagen's 'CopenPay' scheme rewards tourists – but does it actually work?\nA trained theatre director himself, Engel directed a very successful adaptation of Hamlet in 2008, set in the castle's courtyard with tumbledown walls and crumbling masonry – starring a youngClaes Bangas Rosenkrantz – and, after a mutual decision with the local municipality, set up the festival following its success. He has been running and directing the event for the past 17 years.\n\"When you see Hamlet here, you know that you enter the myth,\" said Engel. \"Now you are at the epicentre of it all. It's a special thing: it was actually here that it was written for.\"\nEngel takes me on a tour of some of the other barracks buildings, ending in the Lapidarium, the sculpture storage room of the castle, where a full-size sculpture of Shakespeare sits beside a sleeping Viking warrior, Holger Danske. Danske is another significant figure for the castle: according to legend, when Denmark needs him, he'll wake up and come to its aid. A reproduction of this original model lurks in the gloom of the castle cellars.\nEngel is in the throes of arranging this year's festival, which will take place 6-24 August and feature both Twelfth Night and Hamlet, performed byThe Lord Chamberlain's Men, who take a classical Elizabethan approach to the works and perform with an all-male cast.\n\"This year we've taken a more classical approach,\" said Engel, \"because right now the world is edgy. When we are a little afraid, we don't like it to be upside down and we want it to be more as we know it.\"\nIn testament to the endless ways the play can be reinvented, however, Engel also plans to put on Eddie Izzard's one-person Hamlet at the stage this year. It's often said thatevery minute of every day, Hamlet is being performed somewhere in the world. Shakespeare's most popular play in his lifetime has an afterlife, 425 years later, that surpasses all expectations.\n\"It's one of the greatest pieces of writing in the English language, dealing with the very nature of human existence,\" says Harvey. \"A play wrangling with this fundamental issue with such complexity is always going to mean different things to different people.\"\nVisiting Kronborg Castle, experiencing the \"set\" of the play in real life, certainly brings it to life. As I exit the castle, crossing the bridge over the moat, past the guardhouse to the grass fortifications around the castle, the sounds of marching feet echo through the sound system. I'm back in the world of the play, at the end of Hamlet, joining the march where the prince's body is taken away.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "From Korea's doenjang and gochujang to Hong Kong's XO sauce and East Asia's fish sauce, Asian cuisines provide hundreds of ways to flavour and season dishes.\nAcross Asia, myriad sauces add layers of flavour, depth and instant seasoning to dishes, far surpassing any measure of salt and pepper. From Korea'sdoenjangandgochujangto Hong Kong's XO sauce and East Asia's fish sauce, there are hundreds of different sauces on the market. Many of these have fermentation as a common thread, creating deeply complex flavours that are a result of patience and time. This article will guide you through some of the most common and how to use them.\nThis elusively named condiment originated in Hong Kong, with roots dating to the 1970s and 80s. \"XO\", which stands for \"extra-old\", is a nod to XO cognac – an aged liquor that often signifies wealth and prestige in Hong Kong. However, the semblance between the sauce and the cognac ends there, as there's no actual liquor in XO sauce. \"XO\" simply provides the connotation of luxury, hinting at the array of expensive ingredients within the jar.\nThe condiment, which is a staple of Cantonese cuisine, has foggy origins. Hong Kong'sSun Tung Lokrestaurants have laid claim to its invention, though it's also said that it was first created in 1986 atThe Peninsula Hotel's Spring Moonrestaurant.\nWhile there's no standardised XO recipe, the ingredients typically include dried scallops and shrimp, as well as garlic, red chillies and ginger. Some variations include Chinese dry-cured ham. The resulting sauce is mildly spicy, savoury and smoky. Use it as a condiment with subtly flavoured dishes such as noodles, steamed seafood like scallops and white fish, or on dim sum dishes such as rice rolls and radish cake. XO can also be used as a seasoning to braise meats and flavour vegetables.\nOriginating in China about 2,200 years ago, the first known soy sauce recipe was recorded in an ancientChinese agriculture text, with records showing that some of thefirst versionsof soy sauce were closely linked tojiang, a soybean paste fermented with meat, millet and salt.\nThere are many varieties of soy sauces used worldwide, including Chinese light and dark soy sauce, Hong Kong sweet soy sauce, Japaneseshoyu, Taiwanese soy sauce, Koreanganjangand Indonesiankecap manis. They all consist of the same main ingredients: fermented soybean paste, wheat, yeast and salt.\nChinese soy sauce is brewed in two primary ways: light and dark. Made from the first press of fermented soybeans and aged anywhere from days to months, light soy sauce is thinner and saltier than dark soy and is used in everyday cooking for a pop of flavour. Alternatively, dark soy is made at the end of the pressing process. It is thick, dark and sweet, as it often includes molasses or caramel. It's used sparingly to add colour and roundness to dishes like stir-fries, braises and marinades.\nJapanese soy sauce (shoyu), is typically made with an equal ratio of soybeans and wheat, resulting in a mild, slightly sweet flavour. It has a long brewing time and as such, it's complex and rich. Tamari, which is often used in place of Japanese soy, is made from miso (fermented soybean paste), but without wheat, making it a rich, gluten-free option that can be used in a variety of dishes.\nThis staple condiment is popular in many cuisines, but it's perhaps best known in Thailand where it is believed to have originated (there are conflicting stories of its origin). The sauce tastes as the name would describe – sweet and a little spicy. Primarily made of red chillies, rice wine vinegar and a sweetener like sugar or honey, sweet chilli sauce may also have notes of garlic, rice wine vinegar and fish sauce, depending on the producer.\nCorn starch is usually added to create a slightly thick consistency that makes for a perfect dipping sauce served alongside crunchy, salty and deep-fried dishes such as spring rolls and chicken wings. It also makes a great glaze and adds punchy sweetness to stir-fries.\nIf you've been to a Chinese grocery store, chances are you've come across the Hong Kong sauce giant, Lee Kum Kee. Legend has it that oyster sauce was invented by Lee Kum Sheung in 1888 when he was boiling a pot of oyster soup and accidentally left it on the stove overnight. The next day, the soup was transformed into a thick, caramelised, gravy-like sauce — aka the oyster sauce we know and love today.\nThe sauce is rich, umami-filled and savoury with a hint of sweetness that's perfect for stir-fries, stews and dipping sauces. There are numerous brands on the market and even Lee Kum Kee makes two variations: original and panda oyster sauce. The \"original\" oyster sauce contains about 40% oyster extract while \"panda\" only contains 11%. Oysters naturally contain umami, which means the more oyster extract in your chosen sauce, the deeper and richer your food will taste.\nHoisin sauce is a thick, sweet, savoury sauce popular in Cantonese cuisine. The wordhoisinis derived from the Cantonese pronunciation of \"seafood\" – but there's no actual seafood in the sauce, nor is it typically eaten with seafood. Instead, hoisin sauce is used for vegetable and meat stir-fries or in marinades such aschar siu, a Cantonese-style barbecue pork. It's also often served alongside Peking duck as a dipping sauce, and at Vietnamese restaurants it's used as a condiment forphó(soup with noodles and meat).\nThe main ingredient in hoisin sauce is fermented soybean paste, combined with thickening agents such as corn starch and sweet potato powder. Other ingredients include sesame paste, sugar, rice vinegar and spices such as red chilli peppers and garlic. While peanut butter is often listed in the ingredients of online recipes, there are no peanuts in traditional hoisin sauce.\nFermented black beans (made from soybeans) were discovered in a tomb that was sealed in 165 BCE during China's Han Dynasty, making them theoldest known soy food. The fermented beans are a key ingredient in all-purpose black bean sauce, which includes soy sauce, garlic, ginger, vinegar and sometimes a sweetener like sugar. It's salty, pungent and umami-rich and a versatile ingredient/condiment that can be used in stir-fries and marinades. When used alongside aromatics, proteins and other sauces (such as soy sauce), the intense flavour of the black bean gets diluted, leaving a savoury richness that brings an unmistakable level of extra flavour to a dish. There are variations on the sauce (such as black bean garlic sauce and chili black bean sauce) that merge additional flavours into the fermented beans.\nKorean gochujang is a thick, sticky, fermented red chilli paste that's savoury and spicy with an underlying sweetness. The red paste is made fromgochu-garu(Korean chilli powder), glutinous rice powder, powdered soybeans, grain syrup, malt, salt and water. Traditionally, gochujang is made in the winter and fermented in sunlight for about two to six months.\nMore like this:\n•Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n•Thunder tea rice: The 2,000-year-old healthy grain bowl\n•A restorative soup made for cold season\nGochujang is versatile and can be used as a punchy marinade for meats, dissolved into sauces and soups and added into dips. It's a popular condiment or dipping sauce for dishes like Korean fried chicken andbibimbap(a mixed rice dish) andtteokbokki(rice cakes). Heat levels differ between brands, so make sure to taste to adjust the amount you use accordingly.\nFish sauce is an ancient condiment with roots dating back toGreecein 7th Century BCE, where it was made by fermenting small fish with salt. It's not very different in modern times, as it's typically made with anchovies or other oily fish, shrimp or even krill. It's a key ingredient in East Asian and Southeast Asian cuisines in countries such as Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia and Vietnam, as well as inItalywhere it's calledcolatura. Popular dishes that owe their deliciousness to fish sauce include Thailand'spad thai(a stir-fried noodle dish) andtom yum(a hot and sour soup), Vietnam'snuoc mam chamdipping sauce and Laos'larb(ground meat salad).\nTo make the sauce, fish are placed in barrels with salt and left to ferment for about 12 to 18 months, resulting in a briny and fishy sauce packed with umami. While the sauce may smell overwhelmingly fishy at first whiff, the odour mellows when cooked, leaving behind a subtle, savoury flavour. Because the sauce is so pungent, small amounts go a long way, and it's advisable to taste and adjust the amount of sauce as you cook.\nAdd fish sauce to salad dressings, stir-fries, soups, marinades, braises and even pasta sauces for an added layer of complexity.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "From bubblegum-coloured lakes in Australia to a solar-powered safari camp in Botswana, these are BBC journalists' top destinations this year.\nTravel has the power to connect, inspire and even transform us. Peering over the edge of a crashing waterfall in Newfoundland and ascending sawtooth spires in the Italian Dolomites reveal how wondrous the world can be. But while travel should be a force for good, the past year has reminded us that it also has the potential to overwhelm and even harm the places we love, and many destinations are now imposing new restrictions as they grapple with the negative effects ofovertourism.\nIn the BBC's inaugural guide to the best places to travel this year, we wanted to highlight the destinations experiencing the opposite phenomenon. Each of these 25 spots is not only welcoming visitors and offering incredible travel experiences, but also using tourism to support local communities, protect the environment or preserve their unique cultural heritage. We compiled the list with input from BBC Travel journalists and some of the world's leading sustainable travel authorities, such as theUnited Nations World Travel Organization,Sustainable Travel International, theBlack Travel Allianceand theWorld Travel & Tourism Council.\nAs tourism in many regions soars pastpre-pandemic levels, and extreme weather and climate change reveal the fragile impermanence of many bucket-list destinations, travelling thoughtfully means considering where your trip can serve a larger good.\nFrom trekking through a moonlike landscape in Bolivia to Arctic glamping in Greenland on the world's largest island, your next great adventure is just ahead.\nEver wanted to swim alongside sperm whales? Dominica now offers the chance to do it in an ethical, sustainable way as part of the Caribbean island's groundbreaking commitment to marine conservation and regenerative tourism. The island nation recently established theworld's first sperm whale reserve, a protected marine area designed to safeguard its resident giants. Limited permits for whale swims ensure intimate, respectful encounters, offering visitors a once-in-a-lifetime experience to share the water with these incredible cetaceans while facilitating research and creating sustainable tourism opportunities for local residents.\nNew for 2025, expanded infrastructure and systems are set to welcome visitors, including digital immigration forms to ease arrival and the development of a cable-car system taking riders fromRoseau Valleyup toBoiling Lake, one of the world's largest thermal springs. Access to the island has never been easier: on top of existing American Airlines flights from Miami, United Airlines islaunching direct flightsfrom Newark starting 15 February. Several new hotels are opening in 2025 (adding nearly 500 rooms with a 25% increase in inventory), including the six-star HiltonTranquility Beach Resort and Spain Salisbury. Or choose a tried-and-true classic such asSecret Bay,a luxury eco-property that frequently tops sustainability lists.\nDominica is also home toProject CETI, a groundbreaking international effort todecode whale language, clicks and codas, led by National Geographic Explorer David Gruber. Elsewhere, visitors can explore hidden gorges, towering waterfalls and feast on local cuisine at unique eateries, such as the farm-to-tableLacou. Dominica isn't just a destination – it's a movement to support a burgeoning model of eco-tourism that balances biodiversity conservation with economic growth, ensuring that your adventure helps protect this natural paradise for generations to come. –Pier Nirandara\nHome to one of Yayoi Kusama's iconic yellow, polka-dotted Pumpkin sculptures, the Japanese island ofNaoshimahas become a must-see destination for connoisseurs of contemporary art and architecture. Once known (if at all) for its highly polluting copper smelting industry, the island's transformation is thanks toBenesse Art Site Naoshima, which has helped create major museums and site-specific artworks in the scenically stunning (and dramaticallypopulation-dwindling) Seto Inland Sea, located between Japan's main island of Honshu and Shikoku.\nSpring 2025 sees the opening of theNaoshima New Museum of Art, designed by Tadao Ando, the award-winning architect behind nine other projects on the island. This new showcase for works by Asian artists will be a major highlight of this year'sSetouchi Triennale, with events and unveilings of artwork scattered across 17 islands and coastal areas of the Seto Inland Sea. Scheduled over 100 days and split between spring, summer and autumn to allow visitors to enjoy the region through the different seasons, this is the largest iteration of the Triennale since it began in 2010. The festival and activities of Benesse Art Site Naoshima have been instrumental in turning not only Naoshima's fortunes around but also reviving the neighbouring islands of Teshima and Inujima.\nBook ahead to visit Rei Naito and Ryue Nishizawa'sTeshima Art Museum, a one-of-a-kind synthesis of art, architecture and nature; while on Inujima, travellers will be amazed by the remains of a historic copper refinery reimagined as anepic-scale art installation. Memorable places to stay include Roka, a contemporary-styled ryokan on Naoshima, and the elegantly minimalistEspoir Innon Teshima. –Simon Richmond\nPerpetual fan favourite Italy hardly needs more press – especially in a year when its supremelyovertouristed capital, Rome, will be even more overwhelmed due to the 2025 Jubilee. But if Italy is still on your bucket list for 2025, consider taking a detour north to the Dolomite Mountains.\nFor Italians, the ruggedly beautiful Dolomites are synonymous with family fun and luxury holidays. The stunning sawtooth limestone cliffs sprawl across the regions of Veneto, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, attracting vacationing Italians in droves each year for their exquisite villages;peerless \"white week\" skiing; epic hike; and world-class, stick-to-your-ribs Alpine dishes. This classic Italian playground is often overlooked by overseas visitors – but that's all poised to change.\nThe \"Queen of the Dolomites\",Cortina d'Ampezzo, has been slated to co-host the 2026 Winter Olympics. The preparations, which will take place throughout 2025, include a vast series of infrastructure improvements throughout the area – all against a backdrop of pre-Olympic buzz. Visitors can expect to find expanded ski lift networks in the Dolomiti Superski area, where the towns ofAlta BadiaandVal Gardenawill launch modernised lifts and enhanced connections to public transit operating within the area. New and upgraded cable cars, lifts and gondolas will also be introduced throughout the regions' towns.\nBut the Dolomites is a thrilling destination in all seasons; visit in spring, summer and autumn to enjoy excellent trails, like 2024's newCammino Retico(The Rhaetian Way); a 170km, seven-day trail connecting remote villages between the Veneto and Trentino regions. And for pure relaxation, the luxuryAman Rosa Alpina hotelwill have its grand reopening in 2025. The property will now offer 51 guest rooms and suites, two presidential suites and the private Chalet Zeno. Visit now, before the crowds descend. –Eva Sandoval\nThere is nowhere on Earth likeGreenland. Spanning more than two million sq km, the world's largest island has a population of less than 57,000. Covered by a vast ice cap and spectacular mountains, itsunspoiled wildernessand majestic fjords aren't just acoveted geopolitical entity; they offer adventures of a lifetime.\nStunning hiking and spellbinding whale watching in summer and traditional dog sledding and the magical aurora in winter all make Greenland a bucket-list destination. However, it has been remote, expensive and time-consuming to reach – until now.\nWith the opening of a new international airport in the capital city of Nuuk and two more following in 2026, getting to Greenland has never been easier. The country is welcoming mindful adventure travellers who love exploring while also respecting its incredible nature and unique Inuit culture. Greenland hasadopted a pledge\"towards better tourism\" and a new law aims to steer funds from tourism towards benefitting local communities.\nA modern town with a historic waterfront, informative museums and impressive art galleries,Nuukis also a launchpad for hiking, fishing and glamping trips and acts as a gateway for exploring a remarkable Arctic territory. Further north inIlulissat, visitors can discover the jaw-dropping icebergs of Disko Bay and dramaticUnesco-recognised Icefjord. In the south, a region once settled by Vikings, there are gorgeous fjords and scenic green hills dotted with sheep farms. –Adrienne Murray Nielsen\nThough just one-sixth the size of England and far less visited than its more famous UK counterparts, Wales is filled with stunning national parks, awe-inspiring medieval castles and virtually no crowds – which only adds to its appeal. The new year offers travellers an additional excuse to explore one of Europe's most up-and-coming destinations: Wales is celebrating 2025 as theYear of Croeso(\"Welcome\"). The year-long event showcases Welsh culture, language and attractions while inviting visitors to \"Feel thehwyl\" – an untranslatable Welsh word describing a deep state of joy that comes from being immersed in the moment.\nIn recent years, Wales has positioned itself at the forefront of sustainable, culturally focused travel. Tourism has helped play a role in the revival of the Welsh language and the nation is in the midst of a multi-year £5 billion programme that uses tourism funds to make various destinations more environmentally sustainable. As part of its Year of Croeso, Wales isinvesting in mobility bikesto help more adventure-seekers explore its wild side. What's more, Wales is home to theWales Coast Path, the only hiking path in the world that runs the entire length of a country's coastline. –Eliot Stein\nLabrador, the mainland portion of Newfoundland and Labrador in eastern Canada, is a vast, rugged region known for its windswept coastal villages, towering icebergs, subarctic forests and massive waterfalls – all underpinned by more than 9,000 years of human history. In 2025, the completion of the last stage of the 1,200kmTrans-Labrador Highway– a feat that took nearly 25 years and $1bn to build – transforms this remote 294,330 sq km landscape into a more accessible destination.\nThe new circular route (known as Expedition 51) connects Labrador with five Canadian provinces while offering detours into the US and even France (viaSt Pierre and Miquelon). To encourage sustainable tourism and celebrate the cultural heritage in this formerly isolated part of the north, the Canadian government has invested $180m into Parks Canada sites in Western Newfoundland and Labrador. In 2025,Red Bay National Historic Site, a Unesco World Heritage Site and former Basque whaling station, will debut a new interactive boardwalk and visitor centre;L'Anse aux Meadows, home to the first Norse settlement in North America, is enhancing its ecological protections and upgrading visitor facilities; whileGros Morne National Parkwill introduce new interpretive exhibits that highlight the park's dramatic geology, wildlife and landscapes. –Diane Selkirk\nTucson has a lot to celebrate in 2025. This year marks the 10th anniversary of when it became the first city in the US to receive aUnesco City of Gastronomydistinction, as well as the 250th anniversary of the city's founding. Originally part of Mexico, the area now called Tucson will celebrate its unique multi-national history, as well as the deep-rooted Native American cultures that make it special, with a free event on 23 August featuring traditional Mexican music and dancing held at thePresidio San Agustin del Tucson. Visitors throughout the year can explore Tucson's miles ofdesert hiking trailsand historic buildings – like the 250-year-oldSan Xavier del Bac, the so-called \"White Dove of the Desert\". Preservation like this points to why the city is set to receive a Sustainability Index Award from theGlobal Destination Sustainability Movement(GDS) this year.\nBut while the building's history is impressive, the nearby gardens reveal an even richer history: they are the oldest continuously cultivated soil in the US. Four thousand years ago, the Tohono O'odham's ancestors farmed squashes, beans and corn on this land. After mixing and melding with Mexican and other Indigenous flavours over the centuries, many of these ancient herbs and crops are still staples in kitchens across the city. Diners can immerse themselves in the city's unique food scene at one of itscity-of-gastronomy-certified restaurantsorHeirloom Farmers Markets, which regularly feature unique local ingredients such as chiltepin chilis, edible cacti called nopales and prickly pear. –Lynn Brown\nKnown as the world's most isolated big city,Perth– and the state ofWestern Australia(WA) – have long played second fiddle to the east coast cities of Melbourne and Sydney. However, withAustralia's only direct flights to Europe, Perth is positioning itself as Australia's western gateway and a global aviation hub, with a $5bn redevelopment of Perth Airport set to enhance the travel experience. And withnew connections to Asia, WA is poised to become a must-visit destination in 2025.\nBut it's not just about getting here – it's about what awaits. Outside of newly cool Perth and its gorgeousSwan Valley Wine Region, WA's vast landscapes span more than 2.5 million sq km, encompassing 12,500km of pristine coastline, bubblegum-pink lakes, horizontal waterfalls, towering karri forests, wildflowers, wineries and wildlife encounters like swimming with whale sharks and snapping selfies with quokkas, the \"happiest animal in the world\". Sustainability-minded road trippers can explore it all on the new6,600km Electric Vehicle Highway, the world's longest EV charging network.\nWA is also championing its rich cultural heritage through the A$20mJina Aboriginal Tourism Action Planthat supports authentic Indigenous-led experiences for travellers as well as Indigenous business development. Learn about the oldest living cultures on Earth on atruth-telling walking tourin Rockingham or a4WD tag-along coast foraging tourcomplete with bush barbecue in Broome.\nAdd ancient petroglyphs atMurujuga National Park(under consideration for Unesco World Heritage status in 2025), new disability-friendly infrastructure and equipment on the stunningHoutman Abrolhos Islands,boutique hotelsin Fremantle andtiny dream staysin the Great Southern, and WA is set to redefine travel to Australia this year. –Ellie Cobb\nFrom its misty hilltop tea plantations and roaming wild elephants to its ancient temples and rolling surf, Sri Lanka is a country that ticks lots of boxes. In April 2022, the former prime minister announced Sri Lanka's bankruptcy, but anew presidentaims to rebuild the country's fortunes after it was hit by a pandemic and civil unrest.\nThe resilient island nation is hoping to get back on its feet through tourism. The city ofKandywill see the opening of its first seven-star hotel,Aviyana Private Chalets, whileAarunya Nature Resorthas a new family villa that includes an oculus for stargazing. There's a$1bn megaresortopening in Colombo, and the launch of Sri Lanka's new airlineAir Ceilão, which will fly as far as Europe and Australia. The nation also recently launched theGood Travel Seal initiative, which celebrates local businesses who have adopted sustainable practices.\nVisitors looking for a coolcation can take alegendary train rideinto its mountainous interior, or travel to Colombo and Galle to discover a new generation of mixologists putting their spin on arrack, a 5th-Century drink. The island has also opened the 300kmPekoe Trail, which takes hikers through tea plantations and rural villages in the Central Highlands. For those who want to cover more ground, an innovative startup allows travellers toself-drive a tuk tukacross the island, with the money going directly to the owner. –Claire Turrell\nAfter managing the Panama Canal for decades, the US handed control of it over to Panama at the end of 1999 in a treaty signed by the late US President Jimmy Carter. This year marks the 25th anniversary of Panama's sovereignty over its namesake waterway, and as President-elect Donald Trumphints at the possibilityof using military force to reseize it, a series of new permanent exhibits at the landmark'sMuseo del Canalhighlighting its path to Panamanian rule feels especially timely.\nYet, there's more to see in this nation of vast jungles, idyllic islands and mountainous forests beyond the canal. In 2024, theMeaningful Travel Map to Panamalaunched in partnership with non-profit Tourism Cares to make it easier for visitors to find locally led travel experiences across the country. After embarking on aLocalinptywalking tour through Panama City's Casco Antiguo and El Chorrillo neighbourhoods, head south-west to the La Pintada district, where artists weave fibers to make traditional Panama hats by hand – a Unesco-recognised practice known assombrero pintao. InEl Valle de Anton(named one of the best community tourism villages byUN Tourism in 2024) take a hike through a lush cloud forest on theCerro Gaital Lookout Trailwhere you can see both the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea on a clear day from the summit. This newly opened path is part of Panama's ongoing1,000 km of Trailsproject, which seeks to boost sustainable tourism in rural communities while bringing hikers face to face withPanama's staggering biodiversity. –Kathleen Rellihan\nSnowcapped mountains, sweeping deserts, ancient cities andrich cultural heritagehave long made Morocco one of North Africa's most popular destinations. But theAl Haouz earthquake of September 2023not only devastated parts of Marrakech and the Atlas Mountains, it also severely impacted tourism. As Morocco continues to build (and rebuild) its tourism infrastructure in preparation forco-hosting the 2030 FIFA World Cup, the nation is aiming todouble its tourist arrivalsin the next five years.\nBypass the crowds by taking a road trip through the Rif Mountains in Morocco's less-frequented northern region.The planned 2025-2027 expansionof Morocco's High-Speed Rail (HSR) network will create a multitude of new train lines, including a link from Rabat to the ancient, 1,300-year-old walled Rif Mountain city ofFez; home to aUnesco World Heritage medinaand the host of several games in theAfrica Cup of Nations 2025. From Fez, it's a 65km drive north to Moulay Idriss, an ancient hilltop village once closed to non-Muslims. Pass through olive and almond groves and mountain villages for a stop inOuezzane– a centre of Sufism – then continue north toTalassemtane National Parkto hike through cedar forests, climb craggy red peaks and dive into natural swimming holes. Further north is the town ofChefchaouen, known as the \"Blue Pearl\" for its blue-painted buildings and streets. Finally, cruise along Morocco's northern coast, unwinding in sleepy Mediterranean fishing villages likeEl Jebhaand the white-washed Spanish colonial buildings ofTetouan. –Alicia Erickson\nThe northern English city ofBradfordis finally poised to step out from the long shadow cast by its giant Yorkshire neighbour, Leeds, as it takes its place as the2025 UK City of Culture. A fabulousyear-long programme of eventsincludes the re-opening of theNational Science and Media Museum, plus innovative celebrations of local cultural icons: more than 400 works by Bradford-born artist David Hockneyheld in a Unesco World Heritage 1850s mill; newdigital takeson a fantasy world dreamed up by the famed literary Brontë sisters; and a musical programme mixing anelectronic bassline symphony,old factory folk music,brass bandsandSouth Asian sounds.\nThe diversity of offerings reflects the eye-opening variety of a city whose historic enclaves like Little Germany – where 19th-Century Teutonic wool merchants built an array of neoclassical warehouses – are complemented by a landscape of dramatic moors that play host to an extraordinaryopen-air immersive sound walkmixing contemporary classical music with asculpture trail. A special energy also comes from the local residents who represent diverse backgrounds (and youth – a quarter are under 20 years old).\nBradford's historic streets and rugged country setting helped the city become Britain's firstUnesco City of Film(an accolade shared with places as varied as Rome, Sydney and Busan) – a setting for screen hits including BBC series like Peaky Blinders and Gentleman Jack, and classic films like The Railway Children andWuthering Heights.\nAnd this year, there's even aninteractive cookbook project, celebrating recipes from local communities and showing that in 2025, Bradford is truly a destination to please all tastes. –Norman Miller\nHome to some of the world's most breathtaking desert landscapes and the ancient capital of one of history'smost mysterious civilisations, Jordan never fails to evoke wonder. But take a closer look and you'll find that the country has been quietly building up its reputation as the Middle East's go-to destination for outdoor adventure-seekers.\nIn 2023, a stunning new 10-day, 120km-long hiking path known as theWadi Rum Trailopened, which weaves through the rust-red walls of Jordan's iconic Wadi Rum, tracing the otherworldly landscapes featured in the films Star Wars, Dune and The Martian. Visitors have traditionally breezed through the desert here on 4x4 tours, but this community tourism project promotesa slower, more sustainable form of travelthat protects the desert's delicate ecosystem while safeguarding the rich cultural heritage of the local Bedouin community.\nElsewhere, this Maine-sized nation is teeming with 33 protected land and marine ecosystems. At theWadi Mujib Biosphere Reserve(the world's lowest-lying nature reserve at 410m below sea level), visitors can search for the illusive desert-dwelling Nubian ibex while climbing, swimming and sliding their way through a sandstone gorge to the base of a crashing waterfall.The Dana Biosphere Reserve(Jordan's largest), is home to 180 bird species and 25 endangered mammal species. The rich coral reefs of theAqaba Marine Reserve, which was added to theIUCN Green List of Protected and Conserved Areasin January 2025, support more than 500 fish species and a growingdivingscene. –Florence Craig\nAlmost completely isolated from the outside world for centuries, this erstwhile hermit kingdom nestled in the Himalayas only began welcoming foreigners in 1974. It's since become a global leader in sustainability: it's theworld's first carbon-negative nation, more than 60% of its land is protected forest and it measuresGross National Happinessinstead of GDP.\nThe Haa Valley, a pristine forested district along Bhutan's western frontier with Tibet, has long been the country's best-kept secret: a culturally distinct region still untouched by mass tourism. This forgotten corner of the Thunder Dragon Kingdom was the last district to open to foreigners in 2002, and today, fewer than 2% of international travellers visit, despite it being a yak's graze from Paro International Airport. It's now emerging from the shadows, balancing preservation with thoughtful development in its bid for more visitors.\nTravellers can explore Haa's raw beauty through the newly restored 400kmTrans Bhutan Trail; the freshly-added 11kmHaa Panorama Trail(a revival of an ancient route); and the two-dayJoy Bay Tsho Trek, which snakes through pastures, canopy forests and bamboo groves between the villages of Mochu and Youkha.\nHaa's commitment to sustainable tourism means you'll find locally run homestays (and some local hotels) offering glimpses into centuries-old rural life. Two distinct, low-impact accommodations have also opened: the community-runKatsho Eco Camp, built along the Haa Panorama Trail by guides and cooks who lost their jobs during the pandemic, and the luxurySangwa Camp.Here, visitors witness local culture, likeBon ritualsand rare experiences such as breakfast in Bhutan'slone strict nature reserve, a highly protected biodiversity hotspot home to rare species like the red panda and snow leopard.\nWith Bhutan'sSustainable Daily Feehalved through 2027 (now $100), this once-secluded paradise is now more accessible while remaining just as committed to low-impact tourism. –Erin Levi\nMore than a year after a series of deadly wildfiresdevastated Maui, the entire state is experiencing a dramaticdownturnin visitors. As families and local businesses continue to rebuild, they're asking travellers to return, but todo so responsibly.\nEnter theMālama Hawaiiprogramme. Meaning \"to protect\" or \"give back\",mālamais a Hawaiian word embodying a sense of stewardship and respect for the environment. As such, the programme pairs travellers with more than 350 volunteer opportunities, ranging fromrestoring native foreststosewing and cookingwith Maui families tohelping to preserve plant and animal habitatson the slopes of Mount Kea. In exchange, travellers receive discounted – or in some cases, free – stays atdozens of hotels and resorts across the islands, including the famousFour Seasons Resort Maui at Waileawhere the first season of The White Lotus was filmed. –Eliot Stein\nUzbekistan has one of the youngest populations in the world – more than 60% are under 30. Being surrounded by a sea of young people on Tashkent's metros, which double as art museums with Soviet-era mosaics, you can see a new generation taking over. As the country strives to maintain its unique traditions and cultures, it is investing in tourism with new hotels, train routes, domestic flights and cultural attractions to grow its economy, retain its youth and attract more visitors.\nUzbekistan is getting its first major international biennial with theBukhara Biennialin September 2025. Other major cultural developments include anexpansion of the State Museum of Artsdesigned by Tadao Ando and the restoration and partial reconstruction of thePalace of Prince Romanov.\nAs of May 2024,citizens of more than 90 countries(including the UK, Canada and Australia) can visit Uzbekistan without a visa. The president has said he intends to create aGlobal Green Tourism Startup Labto bring together the country's commitment to a green economy with tourism. Crossing the border with neighbouring countries has also become easier. The region's first international railway route, theSilk Road railway tour, launched in November 2024 and now connects Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. –Kathleen Rellihan\nHaida Gwaii, an archipelago of more than 150 islands off the coast of British Columbia, offers more than breathtaking landscapes – it provides a profound connection to nature, culture and history. Isolated from the mainland, the ecologically rich islands are home to more than 6,800 species, including endemic birds, mammals and plants that have sustained the Haida People for at least 15,000 years.\nWhat makes Haida Gwaii a standout destination in 2025 is the groundbreakingGaayhllxid/Gíihlagalgang \"Rising Tide\" Haida Title Lands Agreement. This legislation marks a transformative moment in Indigenous rights in Canada, officially recognising the Council of the Haida Nation as the territory's governing body under federal law. This shift is working to revitalise Haida culture and strengthen their environmental stewardship.\nVisitors can explore long-abandoned Haida villages likeSG̱ang Gwaay, a Unesco World Heritage Site with ancient mortuary poles and longhouse remains; and encounter distinctive wildlife such as theHaida Gwaii black bear(calledtaanin the local dialect) and seabirds like puffins and ancient murrelets. Upon arrival, guests are introduced to Haida Laws, including the concept ofGina 'waadluxan gud ad kwaagid(\"everything depends on everything else\"), a teaching that underscores our shared responsibility to care for the Earth. –Diane Selkirk\nHome to mist-shrouded rainforests, emerald lakes, towering volcanoes and one of the Americas' oldest and most attractive cities (Unesco-enshrinedGranada, which celebrated its 500th anniversary in December 2024), Central America's largest country remains one of its least visited. That may soon change with the opening of the new Carretera Costanera: a $400m, 350km-long highway linking 53 beaches along the nation's Pacific Coast, from the Gulf of Fonseca in the north to the turquoise waters of Playa El Naranjo in the south.\nSet to be completed in 2025, the ambitious new infrastructure project makes it much easier to shoot south from Nicaragua's sprawling capital, Managua, to the tropical forests and the world-class surf hubs of San Juan del Sur and Popoyo along the country's 50km-long Emerald Coast – which has been luring in-the-know backpackers for years. More importantly, the Costanera is aiming to breathe new economic life into the nation, which isone of the poorestin the Western hemisphere and views itsgrowing tourism sectoras key to its economic growth.\nAfter learning to ride a wave at a locally ownedsurf campand sleeping in atreehousetucked inside a rainforest, venture to theRefugio de Vida Silvestre La Florat the highway's southern tip, where thousands of endangered olive ridley and leatherback turtles lay their eggs between September and October in a once-in-a-lifetime experience. –Eliot Stein\nDespite being ringed on all sides by the UK – Northern Ireland to the west, Scotland to the north, England to the east and Wales to the south – this cliff-fringed island isn't actually part of the Commonwealth. Instead, the self-governing isle is said to be ruled by the world's oldest continuous parliament, the Tynwald, and it's committed to preserving its distinct character and developing a sustainable tourism model.\nAwash with ancient historical sites, such asCashtal yn Ard(\"Castle of the Height\", the largest Neolithic tomb in the British Isles) andCastle Rushen(one of the most complete medieval structures in Europe), the 85,000-resident island is decidedly forward-thinking. In 2016 it was recognised as aUnesco Biosphere(the world's only self-governing territory whose entire land and sea area has such designation) for its commitment to environmental preservation and cultural heritage. This year, witness the isle's spectacular native bird species at the newManx Birdlife Point of Ayre National Reserve, which opened to the public in July 2024. Also on tap for 2025 is the 175th anniversary ofOkell's Brewery, so celebrate this iconic Manx brew by partaking in tasting tours that will be held throughout the year.\nIn addition to learning a few words in Manx Gaelic (the island's historical language) and familiarising yourself with the Manx pound (the island's unique currency), one of the best ways to understand this unique British Crown Dependency is toexplore it on foot. Taking advantage of the isle'smyriadof organisedwalking events, hikers will find rolling English fields, misty Irish hills and craggy Welsh coastlines – as well as dramatic Scottish Highland-esque peaks on the Isle's highest point, Snaefell mountain. On a clear day, trekkers can turn in a circle on its wind-whipped summit to see each country in the UK and Ireland. –Lynn Brown\nPakistan is one of the world's most populated nations, yet it remains one of the great surprises for travellers. That may soon change, as the country is hoping a slew ofresponsible tourism initiativesandnew sustainable effortswill lure eco-conscious visitors to explore its breathtaking northern regions; home to five of the planet's 14 peaks towering over 8,000m – including the world's second highest, K2.\nSalam Pakistan(Pakistan's first-ever national tourism brand, which launched in 2023) allows travellers to easily apply for e-visas and make bookings on the digital platform, including the coveted mountaineering and trekking visa. It only takes a quick glance at the list ofmountain peaksandtreksto see the scale of Pakistan's unmatched adrenaline opportunities.\nYet, Pakistan is much more than staggering mountain trails. The scenic Gilgit-Baltistan region – dubbed \"heaven's gate\" – is brimming with lush valleys, pristine lakes and glacial waterfalls. Cradled between trails are the Hunza Valley's fragrant cherry blossoms and apricot orchards, undulating Unesco-listedDeosai plainsand Shangri-La-esque mirrored lakes. Venture towards the Pakistan-China border to find the Khunjerab Pass, which will be operationalyear-roundstarting in 2025. –Aysha Imtiaz\nMarooned in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean some 1,500km west of Lisbon, this nine-island Portuguese archipelago is one of Europe's most isolated destinations and is known for its steaming natural hot springs, jewel-coloured lakes and sparkling lava tubes. The Azores already boast some of the continent's most dramatic black-sand beaches and bestwhale-watchingopportunities, but the islands can now add another superlative to the list:Europe's largest protected marine sanctuary.\nIn a groundbreaking piece of legislation approved in October 2024, the Azores' newly designated Marine Protected Area will extend 287,000 sq km (an expanse larger than all of Great Britain) and safeguard deep-sea corals, sharks and the 28 species of whales and dolphins found here. Protecting the long-term health and biodiversity of these coral reefs will be a boon for travellers eager to participate in whale-watching and sustainable marine research expeditions in the years to come.\nElsewhere, a scenic drive from the capital of Ponta Delgada,Furnas Valleyis home to two active volcanoes. Spend some time hot spring hopping your way across the bubbling geothermal valley, wander through lush botanical gardens or enjoy a leisurely stroll inTerra Nostra Park, arguably one of Europe's most beautiful parks. Dating back to 1775, the eponymousTerra Nostra Garden Hotelis a bonafide green retreat that will offer guests 24-hour access to their newly enhanced thermal pools and jacuzzis starting in January 2025. Don't leave without sampling thecozido das Furnas– a local meat stew buried underground and slow-cooked using the volcanic hot springs' natural heat. Nearby, sample purple volcanic tea atChalet da Tia Mercês, or plan a visit to the family-ownedGorreana Tea Factory, the oldest (and only) tea plantation in Europe. –Michelle Gross\nKansas City, Missouriis making 2025 its glow-up year. The city heretofore known as \"Paris of the Plains\" is busily promoting its creative arts scene and status as one of North America's barbeque capitals, all while launching an urban revitalisation plan that includes new museums, entertainment districts and hotels.\nAt the heart of the rebrand is theMuseum of BBQ, the world's first museum dedicated to the art of smoked meat. Slated to open at theCrown Centershopping district in spring 2025, the immersive experience will delve intoKansas City's deep barbeque culture, leading visitors through interactive exhibits culminating in a gift shop selling all manner of BBQ goods.\nTheBerkley Riverfrontwill continue to see new dining experiences, shops and apartment buildings among its incoming development.\nTheKansas City International Airportcompleted significant renovations in 2023, with the $1.5bn expansion replacing outdated terminals and improving passenger flow. This year will also see upgrades to theKC Streetcar; a 3.5-mile Main Street extension expected to open this summer that will make it even easier to reach some of the city's premier destinations, including theUnion Hillshopping district and theNational WWI Museum and Memorial– home to the world's most comprehensive collection of World War One objects and documents. And whenRock Island Bridgere-opens in spring 2025, it will become the site of a new entertainment district ­set 40ft feet over a river.– Eva Sandoval\nEven if you've alreadystargazedat the spacelikeUyuni salt flats(the world's largest) and trekked breathlessly around the hilly capital of La Paz (the world's highest), Bolivia is worth a visit in 2025. This August marks the country's 200th anniversary and it's celebrating with events and attractions throughout the year in the capitals of its nine regions.\nVisit from 24 February to 5 March for theOruro Carnival, which includes a multi-day folk-dance parade and has earned Unesco Heritage status for preserving oral tradition. In Potosí, sip abicentennialsingani(Bolivia's answer to Peru'spisco). This strong spirit, now a symbol of national pride, is said to have started viticulture in the region in the 1500s in what was once a booming mining town – and Potosí still has the colonial architecture to prove it.\nBolivia has thelargest proportion of Indigenous people in South America, with roughly two-thirds of the population directly related to the area's original inhabitants. Bolivia's prettiest city, Chuquisaca (also called Sucre), where the declaration of independence was signed in 1825, is home to many Quechua peoples. While there, be suer to visit theMuseo de Arte Indígenafor an up-close look at the country's ancient textile tradition. The Aymara people of the altiplano welcome visitors to the Isla del Sol (an island in the middle of Lake Titicaca) whose moonlike terrain makes for an incredible daylong hike. Elsewhere, a new network ofcommunity-based tourismbrings attractions (and work opportunities) to these sometimes-remote communities, such as theChalalan Ecolodgein the Amazon'sMadidi National Park, where capybaras, cougars and macaws make their homes. –Laura Norkin\nBotswana has been hailed as Africa's leader in green safari tourism due to its expansive wildlife reserves and the government's focus on high-income, low-impact ecotourism policies; a strategy that has traditionally meant allowing fewer tourists. But as the countryushers in a new governmentand continues to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, its tourism sector (and sustainable cache) only stands to grow in 2025, with an increased demand for sustainable and culturally immersive travel experiences. In a bid to bolster tourism and strengthen the economy, Botswana has granted visa-free entry to visitors from 104 countries in recent years – including those from the US, UK, Germany and Canada. This means more travellers can now explore Botswana's natural beauty, including the \"Elephant Capital of the World\",Chobe National Park, and the Unesco-listedOkavango Delta; a vast wetland in the Kalahari Desert that is one of the world's last havens for cheetahs and the black rhinoceros.\nThe Okavango Delta will also see a number of new openings, including the 100% solar-poweredMbamba Campin the delta's lagoon-and-savannah-dotted north, a luxury lodge offering a blend of comfort and family-friendly wildlife adventures that's slated to open in April 2025. Opening in May 2025 isMonachira Camp,where visitors can enjoy walking safaris, mokoro canoe rides andarmchair safariswhile coming face to face with elephants, lions and the Pel's Fishing Owl.\nStarting in April 2025, new Air Botswana routes will connect Gaborone to Cape Town, making it even easier for visitors to explore Botswana's magical nature for themselves – sustainably. –Eva Sandoval\n\"Is it even a city?\" arecent viral adfor Oslo, Norway asked. The tongue-in-cheek video nodded to how overtourism has sullied other European capitals while showcasing the Norwegian capital'sextreme walkability;world-class dining; and easy access to nearby fjords, islands and serenepostcard-perfect landscapes. Known for its modern architecture, sweeping waterfront and no shortage of trees (it's one ofEurope's most-forested cities), Oslo is luring the kinds of visitors who will do their part to ensure that it remainsone of the world's most sustainable cities.\nVisitors here are encouraged to refer to theVisit Oslo Responsiblyguidelines and theGreen Oslo Guide, which break down the concept of sustainable tourism into four categories: planet, people, prosperity and partnership. It's not unusual for hotels in the city centre to feature green roofs that produce food, reduce energy use, manage rainwater and support urban biodiversity.\nTravellers can ensure their visit has a positive impact on residents and the local environment by supporting local businesses like theNorwegian Adventure Company, which offers \"life-changing and sustainable experiences\" from its base in Oslo, like kayaking through glacier-carved fjords, and chasing the Northern Lights.After a long day of exploring the spectacular Nordic countryside, dine at one of the city's many farm-to-table restaurants,likethe Michelin-starredMaaemo, which utilises locally grown organic produce. So, is it even a city?

    "content": "Long associated with swim-up bars and endless beach time, all-inclusive resorts are rewriting the rules to meet the changing expectations of post-pandemic travellers.\nWhen international travel resumed following the easing of Covid-19-related restrictions in 2022, Gregor Nassief, owner of Dominica'sFort Young Hotel and Dive Resort, was preparing for what many were calling the era of \"revenge travel\". With demand surging for all-inclusive holidays, he considered launching simple, one-stop-shop holiday packages. But he quickly realised that Dominica – nicknamed the \"Nature Island of the Caribbean\" – is not your typical beach destination.\n\"Travellers who come here don't want to do the fly-and-flop, where you sit at the beach and do nothing else,\" says Nassief. \"People come here to explore Dominica. It would be impossible for an all-inclusive offering to succeed here if we don't include the island.\"\nNassief's realisation is part of a broader shift in resort travel. Long associated with swim-up-bars, buffets and endless beach time, all-inclusive resorts are adapting to meet the changing expectations of post-pandemic travellers. Many now crave both ease and adventure, seeking a frictionless stay with access to meaningful local experiences. From guided hikes and cultural outings to restaurant dinners and self-drive excursions, the all-inclusive model is expanding to include more of the surrounding destination. The shift, which began in earnest around 2022, continues to evolve in 2025 as more travellers prioritise connection, authenticity and exploration – all from the comfort of a five-star resort.\nNassief's \"island inclusive\" package launched in January 2022, offering guests not only full board and airport transfers, but a daily land or sea group excursion such as a trek to the spectacular waterfalls atTrafalgar Fallsor a guided visit to livelyRoseau Market. Despite requiring a five-night minimum booking and a significant upcharge (the island-inclusive package is $456 per person per night based on double occupancy, while the room-only rate starts at $302 a night), the programme now accounts for 30% of the hotel's all-inclusive leisure bookings.\nA similar model drew Manila-based lawyer Kathrina Sadsad-Tamesis toNay Palad Hideawayon Siargao, a recently trendy island in south-eastern Philippines, in 2024. With rates starting at $900 per person per night, a stay at the luxury resort includes made-to-order meals, massages and private off-property excursions like surfing classes, paddleboarding along nearby mangroves or visiting the picturesque Magpupungko rock pools.\n\"I like the fact that you don't need to check prices once you're there,\" Sadsad-Tamesis says, adding that she would love to see more resorts offering similar packages that build outings into their rate. To her, it encourages a more active trip. \"You don't need to think about what you are going to eat, you don't have to plan your activities, because they planned it all for you.\n\"Sometimes planning is the hardest part,\" she adds, \"so if the resort is already including activities, it is easier to participate.\"\nThis blend of ease and engagement appeals to many travellers. A'Rielle Thomas, a family and honeymoons specialist atFora Travel, estimates that 50% of her all-inclusive clients are now looking for experiences beyond the resort gates. \"They don't want just a flop-and-stop vacation. They want to interact with locals and with the destination,\" she says. Thomas believes that it's an opportunity for resorts to reimagine the guest experience – and tap into a new demographic of travellers who want the best of both worlds: a great beach resort and an opportunity for adventure.\n\"This is a blind spot for many resorts, because for a long time, getting guests offsite hasn't been their focus,\" she explains. \"If I'm staying at a resort but they offer a transfer and a guide to see Chichén Itzá, that's a totally different value proposition and will be more enticing to someone who might not want to sit at a beach the whole time.\"\nBut the excursions don't have to be as involved as a visit to a historical site or a day of island hopping. For some, a change of scenery for a meal could be enough, which is why Sandals launched theirIsland Inclusive diningprogramme in 2022 atSandals Royal Curaçao. The initiative offers guests in select room categories dinner at a local restaurant, complete with transfers and a $250 dining credit. According to Jessica Shannon, chief experience officer at Sandals, this has been a wildly popular perk with a vast majority of qualifying guests taking advantage. The company now plans to bring the activation to the entire Sandals portfolio of 17 resorts.\nOff-site meals are just one part of theLocal Discoveryinitiative atIkos Resorts, which operates seven hotels in Mediterranean hotspots like the island of Kos and the historic city of Marbella. Introduced in 2015, the initiative encourages guests to explore some of Europe's most beautiful regions for no extra cost. In addition to lunches or dinners at seafood taverns and family-owned eateries, visitors can also borrow a car for independent rides through the Costa del Sol or Mallorca's hilly interior.The Museum of Asian Arton Corfu,Pablo Picasso Museumin Marbella andAkrani wineryon Kos are just some of the venues included in the brand's Culture Pass programme, which offers Ikos guests free access.\nMore like this:\n•The 25 best places to travel in 2025\n•The seven travel trends that will shape 2025\n•The biggest travel trend for 2025? Staying away longer\nMeanwhile, in 2023Paradisus by Meliáunveiled their \"Destination-Inclusive concept\" for guests staying in higher rooms categories, which adds off-resort experiences to the all-in packages at many of their resort locations, from Los Cabos, Mexico, to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic and Gran Canaria in Spain. AtParadisus Palma Real Golf & Spa Resort, a guest might be whisked away on a catamaran to practice yoga on an unspoiled beach. AtParadisus by Meliá Gran Canaria, meanwhile, staying in a superior room can include a guided hike around Roque Nublo or a visit to the Banana Museum.\nAccording to Paula Forero, general manager of Paradisus Palma Real, hoteliers are learning that the needs of today's travellers – even those who are booking all-inclusives – have shifted as a result not just of the pandemic but also of social media. Now that travellers can easily consume content about the destinations of their upcoming vacation, they're feeling more intrepid, not wanting to miss out on the sights and sounds of the places they're scouting on platforms like Instagram and TikTok.\n\"Before, travellers were OK with spending seven days at a hotel, resting, enjoying, eating, not thinking,\" Forero explains. \"Now, no. Guests are more curious, because they have access to more information. They want more experiences, more adventures.\"\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "Once emptied of wildlife, South Africa's Babanango Game Reserve is now home to the Big Five – thanks to a bold rewilding project led by Zulu communities and global conservationists.\nDaybreak filters through the fever trees and umbrella thorns of South Africa's White Umfolozi River Valley, splintering orange light across a puckered grassland teeming with newly arrived wildlife. Bumping atop rough roads in an open-sided safari vehicle is field guide Eduan Balt, who's \"reading the bush newspaper\" – studying fresh prints on dirt trails for signs of apex predators.\nBalt drives along some of the valley's 600km of roads – many built in recent years – passingbomas(enclosures) holding quarantined buffalo and a pond where hippos with giant jowls yawn into the morning air. The smell of wild anise wafts over the vehicle as it careens toward the valley floor. Then, suddenly, a lioness darts across the golden grassland to our left, muscling her way to a fallen tree where three kitten-like cubs bound into view.\nThese are the first lions born in this part of KwaZulu-Natal province in at least 150 years. Lions, like most native animals, became locally extinct in the decades following theAnglo-Zulu Warof 1879, after which the British Empire gained control of the region, turning it into farmland. Zulu communities got large swathes of it back during the land reforms that followed the fall of apartheid. But after decades of cattle grazing and illicit hunting, the area was largely depleted of wildlife.\nThat changed starting in 2018, thanks to an innovative collaboration between philanthropic investors, local NGOs and three Zulu community trusts, who leased lands to create one of the most ambitious rewilding projects in South Africa in more than a decade. The 20,000-hectareBabanango Game Reservehas welcomed nearly 4,000 medium- to large-sized animals since the process of game translocation – and remediating landscapes – began, in earnest, five years ago. Many, like the lions, have reproduced. So, there are now about 5,000 wild animals roaming a landscape they were largely absent from for more than a century.\nGerman philanthropists Barbara and Hellmuth Weisser invested nearly 1 billion rand (£42.5m) to rewild these animals. They also bankrolled the tourist infrastructure that should support Babanango's future operational costs. \"I don't know of anyone else doing something quite like this,\" Hellmuth tells me over dinner at theZulu Rock Lodge, one of four safari lodges now spread across the park.\nThe 77-year-old – a former energy executive and keen photographer – has been visiting southern Africa since the 1980s. In retirement, he and his wife wanted to find a place for a park that would uplift communities while restoring biodiversity. \"The problem for us is that there was no supermarket for finding projects,\" he recalls.\nBabanango is south ofKruger National Parkin a poorer region of South Africa closer to Durban than Johannesburg that wasn't historically a safari destination. It appeared on Hellmuth's radar only because the NGOConservation Outcomeshad identified a community trust, Emcakwini, looking for a partner to lease its unpopulated lands.\nHellmuth visited Babanango in 2017 and says he fell in love with its wild topography, including the boulder-strewn hills that tumble down 700m from our hilltop perch at Zulu Rock. \"We didn't want to buy somewhere where there was an existing project that had been run into the ground,\" he recalls. \"When we got here, we found a landscape that was extremely interesting.\"\nIn 2018, the Weissers signed a contract with the Emcakwini Community Trust. Two smaller neighbouring trusts, Esibongweni and Kwa Ngono, came onboard in 2019 and 2020 respectively. All told, about three-fourths of the game reserve is now leased from these communities, who earn a rental fee and share ownership of the animals. The community trusts will also receive 25% of park profits when the project becomes solvent.\nBabanango transformed into a Big Five game reserve in record time, but the process was not without its challenges. First, there was the 2,600 cows, 300 goats and 35 donkeys that the community trusts promised to remove from the land; something that didn't happen for more than three years. Then, in 2022, finally free of livestock, the park could complete its 81km perimeter fence, though much of what was initially laid was cut by ranchers and poachers. A majority of the wild animals arrived beginning in late 2022.\n\"It was very important, becoming a nature reserve, that we have species that were endemic to the area,\" explains Chris Galliers, conservation manager at Conservation Outcomes, which consulted on the project. \"A number of species were completely removed from the system; others like kudu, bushbucks and warthogs were still there in low numbers, but we needed to top them up for genetic purposes.\"\nA few leopards roamed the land, too. Yet, rhinos, buffalo and lions were all reintroduced between May 2022 and March 2023. Elephants were the last of the Big Five to arrive in June 2023. \"It was a big milestone,\" says Galliers. \"It symbolised that everything we had to do to get to that point had been done correctly.\"\nAll rewilded animals live in bomas for several months before release to control for diseases such as foot-and-mouth. Most come from similar habitats to ensure they'll adapt and climatise as quickly as possible. There's also intense monitoring to ensure the balance of predator and prey remains intact. Efforts to discourage poaching includedehorning the rhinos(a procedure that conservationists use to increase the species' survival rates), which I spot my third day at Babanango behind fanning candelabra trees.\nGalliers is the first to acknowledge that the park is a massive disrupter for the region. \"People have, for a large part of the past 200 years, been trying to get rid of these animals because of the threats they posed,\" he says. \"Now, the animals are sitting on their doorsteps again. So, it's quite a thing to try and understand.\"\nOn my fourth and final day, I travel beyond the fence line, past browned fields trampled by cattle, to the village of Denny Dalton. Here, I meet with Thina Nyathi, manager of theAfrican Habitat Conservancy Foundation(AHC), a registered public benefit organisation that supports Babanango with its community development work.\nMore like this:\n•Zimbabwe's stunning 80km safari train\n•The African elephant in the room: Is there such a thing as guilt-free safari?\n•The vital tradition of naming baby gorillas\nNyathi, who was born in KwaZulu-Natal and is a native Zulu speaker, shows me one of the 17 solar-powered boreholes that AHC built to bring running water to neighbouring communities. She also tells me about AHC's efforts to remove invasive plants, such as black wattles, which suck up the region's groundwater. \"We see the direct impact this has on water scarcity because there are streams that were not flowing that, all of the sudden, are flowing again,\" she explains.\nThe foundation works with communities within a 10km radius of Babanango's fence line on everything from conservation education to agricultural support. It also runs vocational training, including classes on ceramics and Zulu beadwork so that the lodges in Babanango can sell crafts that uplift local artisans. \"It's about teaching someone to fish, and not just giving them the fish,\" Nyathi says. \"Working together means we also understand what their challenges are and support them to get to a point where they no longer need our help.\"\nAbout 75% of the staff at Babanango comes from the surrounding communities, and for many, it's their first salaried employment. Dudu Ngcobo, who works as part of the park's ecological restoration team, sent her two daughters to university, which for Nyathi demonstrates the ripple effects of higher-paying job opportunities.\nThe park hires locally for short-term projects, such as land rehabilitation, which helps build a greater understanding of the reserve's potential paybacks and long-term impact. The hope is that Babanango can become a kind a blueprint for other conservation areas on locally owned landscapes. \"Done right, we are able to have quite a big benefit on the environment,\" Nyathi says, \"but also the communities that surround it.\"\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "In Italy’s Dolomites, the ancient coral peaks glow pink at dawn and dusk in a rare natural phenomenon called the enrosadira – a magical moment that makes skiing here unforgettable.\nMaybe it's skiing beneath prehistoric, snow-capped spires or the combination of homemade pasta and Austrian apple strudel. But the après-ski scene just hits differently in Italy's Dolomite Mountains – and the \"enrosadira\" certainly has something to do with it.\nThis rarenatural phenomenonwashes over the Dolomites at dawn and dusk when the sun's rays reflect off the craggy peaks in steamy shades of hot pink and wildfire red. The revered towers and cliffs illuminate, transporting visitors back to when the ancientUnesco World Heritage-listedmountains were a coral reef ascending from the sea. And soon, these spectacular sunsets will light up for the entire world when the Dolomites co-host the Milano Cortina 2026 Olympics and Paralympics. But for now, you can still catch this wild, blushing beauty without all the crowds.\nIt's no surprise that enrosadira translates to \"turning pink\" in the Dolomites' ancientLadinlanguage (the world's last spoken Latin dialect). Like many Ladin traditions, tales of these mountains have been passed down for centuries. According to local legend, the magenta, amber and violet-tinged-bedrock that arrives every morning and evening is what's left of an elf king's beloved rose garden after his daughter was taken away by a suitor. Broken-hearted, he cast a spell forbidding anyone from seeing the beauty of his magical rose garden in the light of day again – only he left out daybreak and twilight.\n\"Enrosadira is deeply rooted in our Ladin tradition and linked to legends, emotions and a strong sense of belonging to the land,\" says Nicole Dorigo, a Ladin living in the Dolomites' Alta Badia region in the southern part of the Tyrol valley. \"The play of lights on the mountains creates a magical and evocative atmosphere, conveying a sense of peace and connection with our homeland and the natural beauty that surrounds us.\"\nOf course, the vibrant rock hues can also be explained by science. Back in the 1700s, French geologist Deodat de Dolomieu discovered that the range's peaks aren't pure limestone, as many previously believed. They're made of dolomite – a rock formed millions of years ago in acontinental collisionthat uprooted the coral reef and islands between Africa and Europe. Magnesium-rich seawater slowly transformed the limestone reefs into a pale gray and tan sediment that reflects and re-emits more light than regular limestone, explaining why these mountains shine so brightly and vividly.\n\"The dolomite layers were all covered by the sea in ancient times. All the sediment from the fish and mud became concrete when the water flooded around it, forming many unique rock shapes,\" says Andrea Milani, a climbing and ski guide forDolomite Mountainstours. \"In the morning and evening when the sun goes down, with a clear sky, the mountains turn pink.\"\nToday these ancient sea beds have become one of the world's premier ski regions, offering 12 interconnectedDolomiti Superskiresorts. So, after a day on the slopes, over long, deep snowy peaks and valleys where tectonic plates once collided, pull up a lawn chair and watch the sun rays reflect an intense mauve and deep orange. For the best show, face west at sunset or east at sunrise under a clear sky. The lower the sun sits on the horizon, the more dramatic the colours.\nApres-ski doesn't get better than Aperol spritz under enrosadira in crisp mountain air – unless you're lucky enough to find a fossilised seashell in the snow. Here are some of the best après-ski spots to watch the Dolomites blush pink:\nSip an apéritif on the terrace of this luxurySouth Tyrolean hoteloverlooking the famousCatinaccio(also called Rosengarten) mountains – the mythical setting of Ladin king Laurin's rose garden. In real life, these mountains frame Alpine meadows with a 17th-Century chapel, an old watermill and nature park. After your après-ski sunset experience, dine at the resort's restaurant on fresh, regionally inspired fare.\nOn a candlelit Lake Sompunt, nestled between the towering mastiffs, liesDelights On Icewhere tuxedoed servers on figure skates bring you Champagne, wowing you with waltz jumps, sizzles and glides as this small frozen pond reflects the rose-colored peaks at sunset. As sommeliers pour Teroldego and other South Tyrolean wines, local chefs dazzle with traditional Italian, German, Austrian and Ladin dishes like homemade silky polenta and spicy goulash.

    "content": "The Cook Islands is proving that sustainable tourism isn't just possible – it's essential. Here's how this South Pacific nation is preserving their paradise for generations for come.\nLanding on Rarotonga, the largest of the Cook Islands chain felt like stepping back in time. Gazing out of the taxi from Rarotonga airport to our resort, we were immediately struck by the absence of high-rise hotels, fast-food restaurants and corporate chains. There were no traffic lights, only coconut palms lining the road, the scent of salt and frangipani drifting through the air and the jungle meeting the ocean in a seamless panorama. It felt like Hawaii in the 1960s: uncrowded, laid-back and refreshingly authentic.\nOur taxi driver pointed to a low-slung resort along the shoreline. \"No building can be higher than a coconut tree,\" she said. This isn't just a local tradition but a law set in 1965 by the Cook Islands' first premier, Albert Henry, to prevent overdevelopment. She explained that only Cook Islanders can own land, ensuring that large corporations don't dominate the landscape. We looked out onto hotels blending naturally into their surroundings and white-sand beaches ringed with long green parks, all free from litter and crowds.\nWe soon learned that this preservation of paradise is deeply intentional. Cook Islanders have made a conscious effort to ensure that Rarotonga never follows the path of overdevelopment seen in places like Honolulu. Instead, locals have committed to conservation, low-impact tourism and sustainable practices that benefit both locals and visitors. \"People come here because it is a paradise uncluttered by overdevelopment,\" explained Jeremy Goodwin, regenerative tourism manager for the Cook Islands Tourism Corporation (CITC). \"Our sacred duty as custodians of the land is to look after our paradise.\"\nThe Cook Islands, an archipelago of 15 islands between New Zealand and Hawaii, has been self-governing in free association with New Zealand since 1965. With a total population of 21,000, the islands are divided into two groups: the Southern Cook Islands, which includes the more accessible Rarotonga and Aitutaki, and the remote Northern Cook Islands, made up of low-lying coral atolls. Cook Islanders have their own Māori language, with different dialects across the islands. And while tourism is a key industry, the islanders have ensured that sustainability remains at the nation's core.\n\"For hundreds of years, the protection of the Cook Islands relied on the traditional Ra'ui System where access to a particular resource or area is forbidden for a given period,\" explained Karla Eggelton, CEO of CITC. \"The system aims to conserve food resources and protect ecological conditions in lagoons, reefs and other marine resources.\"\nThis philosophy persists today – and extends beyond the sea. On the northern island of Pukapuka, for example, locals have practiced sustainable living for centuries, packing up their belongings and sailing by boat to another atoll within the lagoon for seasonal periods to prevent resource depletion. They fish and farm only what they need, maintaining a delicate balance with nature.\nOn arrival atThe Rarotongan Beach Resort and Lagoonarium, staff welcomed us with a warm \"Kia Orana\", a greeting that translates to \"may you live long\". It's a unique gesture of friendship from islanders renowned for their hospitality and warmth. The resort overlooks the Aroa Lagoonarium, a snorkelling haven and a sanctuary for butterflyfish, parrotfish and angelfish. Part natural lagoon and part enclosed habitat, it is designed to support marine conservation, serving both as a coral nursery and a protected area for marine life to flourish.\nAs the days passed, we saw how sustainability is woven into everyday life across the islands. At theMuri Night Market, a popular outdoor dinner option, we watched vendors prepare island dishes likeika mata(raw fish marinated in lime and coconut milk) andrukau rukau(taro leaves in coconut cream), all using local ingredients. We were struck by the market's Rent-a-Plate project, where visitors can borrow reusable plates and cutlery instead of using disposable plastic. Cook Islanders also promote clean water initiatives. We purchased reusable bottles from the visitor's centre and refilled them at free UV-treated water stations around the island, a project led by the Te Ipukarea Society to minimise plastic waste.\nBeyond sustainable dining, Cook Islanders have taken marine conservation to a global scale. In 2017, the country established theMarae Moana Marine Park, making the 15 islands the world's largest multi-use marine protected area, covering 1.9 million square kilometres. The legislation also bans large-scale commercial fishing and seabed mining within 50 nautical miles of each island.\n\"Marae Moana is the idea of shared space, a new concept of creating a sanctuary and the conservation effort that allows for shared, sustainable activity,\" said Eggelton.\nAlso offering opportunities for sustainable tourism is Aitutaki, a bucolic island neighbouring Rarotonga that's known for its snow-white sand beaches, volcanic rock, coconut palms and crystal-clear lagoons. Here thePacific Resort Aitutakihas launched a coral restoration project where guests can take part by affixing coral fragments to underwater mesh tables, helping regenerate the reef.\n\"The project is an example of Mana Tiaki or island conservation,\" explains Goodwin. \"Mana Tiaki means guardianship with a sacred purpose.\" He explained that culturally, for most Polynesians, the ocean is sacrosanct. \"The beaches bring tourists to this holiday destination, but they also connect Cook Islanders to the ocean.\"\nAs the days passed, we explored the endless powdery white-sand beaches that ring Rarotonga, from Aroa Beach where fiery, colourful sunsets painted the sky with hues of vivid orange and crimson to serene and scenic Titikaveka Beach. They were all pristine and uncrowded, lined by palm trees, parkways and picnic tables. Most were unobstructed, with no commercial buildings to obstruct the view.\nMore like this:\n•New Zealand's 'vanished world' of ancient megafauna\n•The 333 islands opening to the world\n•Saving the night sky: New Zealand's craziest experiment yet?\nAt Muri Beach, we opted for a sea turtle snorkelling tour. Our guide, Eric, explained the importance of turtles to the Cook Islands economically, environmentally and culturally. Daily tour operators earn an income by taking paying passengers to see these graceful, curious creatures. Plus, sea turtles are a key indicator of coastal ecosystem health, so monitoring and preservation are vital. Eric told us about a rescuer who found a turtle caught in a fishing net. Once freed, theTe Ara O Te Onu(Cook Island Sea Turtle Society) rehabilitated the turtle, as they have done dozens of times in the past. In addition to the society's efforts, visitors are encouraged to help track turtle movement through theCitizen Science Projectby taking photos and sending them into the programme.\nBy the time our trip had come to an end, we better understood how Cook Islanders have created a blueprint for preserving paradise by blending ancient conservation methods with modern environmental initiatives. \"It's about leaving both the people and the place better off than you found it,\" said Eggelton.\nGoodwin echoed the sentiment: This is our little paradise; if we all look after it, she will look after us.\"\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "The tiny Mediterranean paradise of Comino has long been overrun by tourists, many lured by social media to photograph its iconic Blue Lagoon. Now, the island is fighting back.\nSitting in a cafe in Marfa Bay, Malta, Colin Backhouse gazes out at a tiny landmass on the horizon: the 3km-by-5km islet of Comino, a sun-baked slab of rock surrounded by a shimmering sea that shifts from deep blue to bright turquoise. Once a near-empty haven, today it is one of the most contested tourist destinations in the Maltese archipelago.\nWith more than 51,000 followers on his popular Facebook page,Malta Holiday Experiences, Backhouse dedicates his time to recommending the best spots to explore across the Maltese Islands. But there's one place he refuses to endorse.\n\"It's wonderful at this time of year,\" he says, nodding toward the car-free islet located between Malta and Gozo. \"But in summer? You couldn't pay me to go near it. It’s hell on Earth.\"\nLuring tens of thousands of visitors annually from across the globe, Comino’sBlue Lagoonis a photographer's dream and one of the Mediterranean's most iconic destinations. The bay's vivid hue, caused by sunlight reflecting off the white limestone seabed, sparkles under the Mediterranean sun, making it a perfect subject for stunning photos.\nIn the December to February low season, the bay’s waters remain barely disturbed, except for the gentle ripple of a landing gull. The shoreline is silent, the coastline untouched. But summer tells a different story. Shoulder-to-shoulder crowds jostle for space, litter spills from overflowing bins and tangles in trampled rock rose shrubs, while gas-guzzling powerboats blast music and leave behind a trail of environmental damage.\nBackhouse remembers a time when Comino felt like a secluded escape. \"I first visited in 1980. Back then, you could have the whole place to yourself. Unfortunately, I've seen first-hand the destruction over the decades. I really don't know why people bother anymore.\"\nHe's not alone in his sentiment. Frustration over Comino's overtourism has been growing for years, with some disillusioned visitors going as far as to call the day-trip experience from Malta a \"scam\". Overcrowded boats, limited amenities and worsening environmental degradation have led to mounting pressure on authorities to act.\nIn response, activists have stepped in. In 2022, a local group called Movimenti Graffiti took matters into their own hands by stripping the island of its deckchairs and sunbeds,protestingwhat they saw as an exploitation of public space for private profit. Their message was clear: Comino should be protected, not plundered.\nMore like this:\n•Is this the end of the Mediterranean beach holiday?\n•The summer that tourism fell apart\n•Four countries that are actively welcoming travellers\nThe isle's ascent to a dream destination is an interesting one. Having served as a backdrop in films and series such as The Count of Monte Cristo, Troy and even briefly in Game of Thrones, The Blue Lagoon was already a well-known cinematic gem. But social media caused its popularity to soar. Its surreal iridescent waters began attracting travellers from around the world in search of the perfect photo.\n\"It's at the top of many visitors' bucket lists when they come to the Maltese islands,\" says Rebecca Millo, head of marketing and corporate communications at KM Malta, the country's national airline. \"Many people just want to go straight there.\"\nBut change is finally coming. This year, in an effort to curb mass tourism and relieve pressure on the islet, which is a designated Natura 2000 site, Maltese authorities are introducing a daily visitor cap – reducing the number of tour boat day-trippers from 10,000 to 5,000. It's a significant step in the right direction, but for environmental advocates like Mark Sultana, CEO of BirdLife Malta, it's only a partial fix.\n\"Limiting numbers is a good start,\" he says. \"But we need a public sustainability plan that doesn't just focus on crowd control but also on preserving Comino's fragile ecosystem. We are insisting it should have a ticket control system where only a capped number of tickets can be issued each day.\"\nComino's struggles are not unique. Across the Mediterranean, governments are tightening regulations tocombat overtourism. Venice has introducedentry fees for day-trippers, while Athens hascapped daily visitor numbersto the Acropolis. These shifts signal a broader push towards more sustainable travel.\nSeasoned Malta tour guide Joanne Gatt hears a recurring complaint from tourists: visiting the tiny isle isn't the experience they signed up for. \"They go to Comino expecting paradise and leave disappointed,\" she says. \"Overcrowded, chaotic. Hopefully the cap on visitors will make a real difference.\"\nWith the new regulations in place, the hope is that Comino can regain some of its lost charm, offering a more enjoyable experience while safeguarding its ecosystem. But some feel the damage is already done. \"With so many people wearing it down year after year, I just hope there's something left for future generations to enjoy,\" Gatt reflects.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

But now, the world's steepest cable car whisks travellers to the 430-person village.\nOn a freezing day in December 2024, I took a scenic three-hour train ride from Geneva toLauterbrunnen, an Alpine village nestled betweenInterlakenand the Jungfrau massif in central Switzerland. I was now at the gateway to the car-free mountain hamletofMürren.\nFor most of Mürren's history, residents would lead their mules three hours down to gather essential supplies in the valley before trekking back up. Then in 1891, a narrow-gauge railway opened, connecting Mürren to the nearby mountain village of Grütschalp and a funicular that reached Lauterbrunnen. In 1965, a single-track cableway opened that could ferry residents down to another traffic-free village, Gimmelwald, above the valley.\nBut the day I arrived, this formerly secluded 430-person hamlet perched 1638m in theBernese Oberlandbecame directly connected with the outside world and valley below through the opening of the world's steepest cable car: theSchilthornbahn, which whisks travellers 775m up through some of the Swiss Alps' most jaw-dropping scenery in just four minutes.\nAfter arriving at theStechelberg car park,I was soon being hoisted from the valley floor up in a glass-enclosed cabin, staring down towards the storybook cottages below and surrounded by craggy mountains and snow-covered pines. The trip up the vertical Mürrenfluh rockface was so smooth that I barely noticed the 159.4% gradient (the world's previous steepest cable car, theLoen Skyliftin Norway, rises 133%), until my ears started to pop.\nPerched on a natural terrace at the foot of theSchilthornsummit (2970m) overlooking the Lauterbrunnen valley, Mürren is a 13th-Century village with traditional stone and timber cottages that looks like it's clinging to the edge of a cliff. Because of its unique position, engineers have never been able to connect it to the outside world by road.\n\"Taking the cable car to school might seem unusual to many, but it was an everyday ritual for me,\" said Mürren native Michael Abegglen. \"Most everyday necessities and services are available in Mürren, but every time we need a doctor, hairdresser or dentist, we need to go down to the valley where many of us have our cars parked.\"\nAccording to Abegglen, the village's few year-round residents have long relied on one another. \"When you grow up here like I did, you know almost everyone, and there's a strong close-knit community,\" Abegglen adds. \"Some guests are like locals, as they return to Mürren every single year.\"\nAfter checking into theHotel Alpenruh, and admiring the awe-inspiring, 360-degree views of the Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau peaks from my balcony, I soon discovered that – unsurprisingly – this pocket-sized, car-free village is best explored on foot.\nMürren's few streets are lined with cosy inns; rustic restaurants serving Alpine cheeses and dry sausages; bars offering evening aperitifs; and quaint souvenir shops selling postcards, fine Swiss chocolates, cuckoo clocks and cowbells. One of Mürren's main landmarks is theHotel Mürren Palace, built in 1874 and nicknamed \"Switzerland's first palace\" after its history of hosting celebrity skiers and Hollywood actors like Rita Hayworth. Oozing elegance and grandeur, its ballroom served as a meeting point for high society back in the 20th Century. As the snow fell, I popped into the pub at theEiger Guesthouseto warm up over a mug ofglühwein(traditional mulled wine).\nDespite its diminutive size, Mürren is a major winter sports hub. This former sleepyWalser settlementtransformed in the late 1800s when British skiers discovered the village and fell in love with its scenery (and slopes).\n\"My great-grandfather Henry Lunn first came to Mürren in the 1890s and was smitten by its breathtaking beauty,\" said Bernard Lunn, a self-proclaimed \"ski bum\" and village resident. \"He soon started bringing British tourists here to witness the glorious 'triumvirate' of [the] Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau peaks. Later, my mountaineer grandfather Arnold Lunn and his wife Mabel started living here, and in 1922, Arnold founded the[world's] first slalom ski races. Mabel and a group of British Women established theLadies' Ski Clubhere as well.\"\nArnold's arrival also paved the way for the formation of theKandahar Ski Clubin 1924 and the inauguration of the country's first ski school in Mürren in 1930.A year later, the firstAlpine World Ski Championshipskicked off in this tiny town in February 1931.\nNearly a century later, the surrounding mountains are laced with 54km of fresh, powdery pistes connected through cable cars, funiculars and chairlifts. When snow conditions allow, you can ski 16km from the Schilthorn summit to the valley floor in Lauterbrunnen.\n\"A coffee at the peak and a trip down on skis with family and friends is how I love spending my winter days in Mürren,\" said Alan Ramsay, a sociable Scot who has called the village home for more than 25 years and helps organise theInternational Inferno, the world's biggest amateur ski race held in the town annually (21-24 January 2026).\nBut locals say there's more to Mürren than just skiing. From June through September, the area becomes a popular paragliding destination, offering magnificent birds-eye views over the region's soaring crags, turquoise lakes and more than 70 cascadingwaterfalls.You can also stroll the flower-studdedtrailsand meadows dotted with grazing sheep.\n\"The mountains are an ever-changing canvas,\" said Belinda Bühler, an avid trail runner who has lived her whole life in Mürren. \"In the winter, they wear a beautiful white coat. In the summer, the mood changes depending on whether we are having hot, rainy or foggy days. However, as winter slowly departs, you can already smell the scent of spring. As the earth starts to warm up, you see early summer blossoms and soon there are flower-filled meadows.\"\nBühler's main advice for those coming outside of ski season? \"Get out into nature onto the trails. You don't have to walk too far but as soon as you're on a trail, you're alone and can savour the stillness and beauty most palpably. The air is so pure and clean. I have grown up in Murren but I always call myself a local tourist, as I still tend to stop and take photos during my hikes. What I feel, see and hear on the trails in Mürren is indescribable!\"\nBernard's wife, Julia Lunn, who leads families and women on hikes in Murren added, \"People don't come here to shop or sightsee, but to experience life through skiing, snowshoeing, hiking, or simple pleasures like taking in the unrivalled views in solitude and dipping into the streams or the unspoiledGrauseelilake.\"\nAt Ramsay's advice, I decided to experience one of those simple pleasures for myself. After grabbing a wooden sledge from the localIntersportrental shop, I took the funicular up to the Allmendhubel mountain station (the starting point of the infamous 3kmBob Chasefeatured in the 1969 James Bond film On Her Majesty’s Secret Service). After a few quick practice runs, I whisked down the soft, powdery slopes of the Blumental Valley, peppered with pines and chalet-like holiday homes with a sense of wonder and a child-like grin plastered across my face.\n\"When growing up in Mürren as a child, I didn't realise how lucky I was because I took [this] all for granted,\" said Bühler. \"As a teenager, I even found the village too small and limiting. However, after I travelled around a bit and returned to Murren, I fell in love with it all over again, especially with the sense of freedom it gave me. Today, I often feel speechless when I wake up here and find it hard to describe Mürren, because no words seem to do its beauty justice. It is a place that needs to be experienced and felt.\"\nEven after just a two-day visit, I think I know what she means.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "In the male-dominated world of Delhi's kabootarbazi, one woman's passion for her birds has earned her respect, admiration – and a place in the sky.\nAs dusk descends on Old Delhi, the bustling streets grow even more crowded, with pedestrians inching forward through jam-packed streets and auto-rickshaws honking impatiently. But above the chaos, a quieter ritual takes flight. On rooftops across the old quarters,kabootarbaaz(pigeon keepers) release their cherished flocks into the sky. Whistles pierce the air and calls echo from rooftop to rooftop. And the birds respond, transforming the skyline into a swirling spectacle.\nPigeon keeping in Old Delhi is more than a pastime; it's an umbilical cord to the identity of Old Delhi that's rooted in the city's Mughal heritage. \"A kabootarbaaz takes immense pride in their pigeons,\" says Ratnendu Ray, who conducts heritage walks in Delhi for the Indian National Trust for Art & Cultural Heritage (INTACH). \"It's a sense of self, cultural identity and belonging.\"\nThe tradition of pigeon keeping, known askabootarbazi,dates to ancient times, tracing its roots to the era of theMahabharata(between 400BC and AD200) when the birds were kept in palaces to entertain royalty. \"Women of the court would often sit in theirjharokhas(balconies) and watch the pigeons in flight,\" says author and historian Rana Safvi.\nHowever, she explains, it was under the Muslim rulers that this pastime evolved into a popular sport.\n\"The sport reached its zenith under Emperor Jahangir, who likened kabutarbaazi toishqbaazi(the art of love) and brought expert pigeon trainers to Delhi, elevating the tradition to a new level of refinement.\"\nThousands of pigeon keepers across the city carry on this tradition, rising through the ranks fromshagird, or trainee, eventually rising to be akhalifa. \"[They are] finally recognised by the fraternity as anustaad– the highest level one can attain,\" says Ray.\nWhile kabootarbazi is traditionally a man's job passed down from father to son over the centuries, Shaheen Parveen has the distinction of being the only female pigeon keeper in Delhi.\nIn the neighbourhood of Khawaja Mir Dard Basti, Parveen transitions through various roles in a day, from devoted wife to mother to grandmother. However, as soon as she is alone, she climbs up the bamboo stairs that lead to the rooftop of her house, high above the crammed lanes where men savour kebabs frying in small eateries.\nShe starts her day inspecting her more than 100 pigeons, ensuring that each one is healthy before feeding them a custom grain mix. She then trains them through timed flights, using whistles or claps for recall. Evenings involve roll calls and nest checks; she also perfects their skills for competitions.\nAt sunset, Parveen's voice stands out from the myriad calls of men echoing for pigeons. As she raises her voice to the highest pitch, people peer out of their windows and from their terraces to catch a glimpse of their favourite pigeon keeper.\nBeing a kabootarbaaz is both tradition and passion, and Parveen says that spending time with the birds brings her a sense of peace and tranquillity. \"If I don't spend time with them, I feel sick; they are like my children,\" she says.\nParveen's rise to the respected status she now holds within the male-dominated community has been far from easy.\nShe credits her father for her love of the sport. \"Every day after returning from school, he would take me to the rooftop to see his pigeons and that is when my love for the birds began,\" she says. However, she had to contend with the disapproval of her brother, who forbade her from pursuing the hobby. Later, she faced criticism from others who claimed it was unbecoming for a woman.\nHowever, she persisted, driven by her love for the birds. \"When your skills are praised and the community respects you for them, you feel uplifted, then the voices of those who speak against you don't matter,\" she says. \"Let people say whatever they want to, I will continue doing what I want and what gives me peace.\"\nParveen has earned widespread respect across the community for her talents. \"People see the visit of an experienced pigeon keeper to their roofs as a blessing; I receive many offers from people requesting me to bless their pigeons,\" she says with a smile. However, she usually declines these offers: \"I don't get time from my own pigeons; also it is tiring.\"\nExperienced pigeon keepers like Mohsin Ustaad take out time from their busy schedules to support Parveen with feed and medicine, expenses that she sometimes struggles to afford. \"I came to her terrace because I respect her and have admiration for her skill,\" says Mohsin. Parveen smiles shyly: \"It costs thousands of rupees – thankfully Mohsin helps us.\"\nParveen's biggest triumph came when her pigeons won a major local race that drew hundreds of ustaads and hobbyists from Old Delhi and beyond – many of whom had trained their birds for months or years in preparation. In the race, the pigeons were released from a remote location and had to find their way back home. Judging was based on speed, endurance and how well the pigeons responded to their ustaad's calls.\nMore like this:\n•Thirteen photos that will make you care about the ocean\n•A 58-tunnel slow train through India's Eastern Ghats\n•Witnessing the synchronised dance of a million starlings in Denmark\nRace winners are awarded trophies, cash prizes and immense respect within the kabootarbazi community. Afterwards, scores of pigeon keepers presented Parveen with gifts. \"Some even gave me money. It was like India had won the World Cup, some put garlands on me, I was nervous and happy,\" she says, showing videos and pictures of the event.\n\"People recognised her, she got more respect,\" her daughter adds.\nPigeon keeping has also become an attraction for travellers visiting Delhi, who are intrigued to see a way of life they may have seen in Bollywood movies but never witnessed for themselves.\nKabootarbaazi, Ray says, is governed by a rich set of social structures, unspoken rules and codes of conduct. \"Pigeon-keepers often operate within specific territories, usually based around their neighbourhood or rooftop,\" he explains. \"Venturing into territory of others is seen as disrespectful. There are also competitions and tournaments; witnessing all of it is a traveller's delight.\"\nHis heritage walkPrayer, power and pigeon: A heritage walk and kabootarbazintroduces visitors to this world, walking through the winding alleys between houses and watching the birds soaring through the open city skies.\nContent creators are also flocking to Old Delhi to capture the sight of the birds soaring and swirling in the sky. As they climb up to the terraces, seasoned pigeon keepers spring into action. They tighten their grip on the mesh used to guide the birds mid-flight with swift, practiced motions; they whistle, clap and call out in rhythmic chants.\nThe pigeons, mid-flight, respond in unison, veering back toward home, their wings slicing through the air in a synchronised dance. \"I've been following pages of pigeon keepers on YouTube and other platforms for some time now,\" says Imran Ahmed, who came to take photos for his social media platforms. \"Today, I'm glad to finally be among them, capturing photos and being photographed alongside these beautiful birds.\"\nAs the day ends, Parveen climbs to her terrace and lets her birds out. When they reach a certain height, she calls them to return. They respond right away. \"I train each bird to recognise my voice, to know my call and trust me. It's a bond that you can't build overnight,\" Parveen explains, adjusting her pigeons' feed.\nThough not an official ustaad yet, her skill and status are undeniable. \"These birds feel my moods, and I feel theirs,\" she says, smiling. \"In this world of feathers and sky, they know me as I know them. That's something no one can take from me.\"\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "She jets around the world for her high-profile beauty career, but her heart is in Seoul. Here are her top K-beauty experiences in town, from face lasers to body scrubs.\nFor Chriselle Lim – style guru,digital creatorand creative director ofPHLURfragrances – self-care is a way of life. Especially when she visits South Korea, the birthplace of the viral \"K-beauty\"–  beloved for its multi-layer \"glass skin\" skincare regimens and high-tech sun creams.\n\"Beauty and self-care in Korea is a daily thing,\" says the fresh-faced and flawlessly stylish Lim, who spent her formative years in the glamorous South Korean capital and returns with her daughters each year. \"It's not about hitting a certain age and then taking care of your skin. You just do it since you're a very young girl. As we're trying to reverse [sun damage] here in the States, in Korea, the women have been taught to protect themselves early on. We were always embarrassed about our moms taking us around in their crazy massive sun hats and their gloves. But now I get it. I've become that lady.\"\nWhile innovative Korean products likecollagen sheet maskscontinue to dominate the international market, Korea is also seeing an uptick inbeauty tourism.Consumers can visit \"skin clinics\" for medical aesthetic treatments powered by ultra-modern Korean technologies; often not yet approved by the FDA. Adding to the appeal, patients can get several treatments – from Botox toTitanium skin liftingtoliquid laser sun spot removal– in one sitting with jaw-dropping transformations and little downtime – compared to Western protocols, which require patients wait 28 days between treatments.\n\"I have a lot of followers that ask me for tips and where to go,\" says Lim. \"It makes a lot of sense. One, the technology is there. And two, it's so much cheaper [than the US], at least by five times. The flight there, renting an Airbnb or a hotel; it actually makes a lot of sense because you are saving money in the long run.\"\nNot that Lim ever needs a reason to visit Seoul. \"It's a fast-paced city that is extremely clean, chic, sophisticated,\" she says. \"Just imagine fashion and art and beauty all combined in one. It's one of those places I go whenever I'm feeling like I need inspiration.\"\nHere is Lim's go-to plan for a self-care holiday in Seoul.\nGangnam, the stylish district made world-famous by acertain 2012 K-pop song, is consideredSeoul's K-beauty and medical tourism hot spot– and it's where Lim's self-care holidays start. First stop:Eun Skin Clinicin the affluent Cheongdam neighbourhood, south of the Han River.\n\"They do incredible lasers, the best I've experienced,\" says Lim. \"They speak really good English there, which is a big make or break for me because I'm not fluent in Korean. And because [the doctor] deals with a lot of English-speaking people, I think she realises that a lot of them are here to explore and have fun, so she doesn't want to be so aggressive with their face. They do a very customised approach.\"\nKorean skin lasers, notes Lim, are so gentle they can even be layered on top of each other to compound their transformative effects.\n\"It's very, very gentle,\" says Lim of her most recent visit. \"I did something calledRubytoning; helps with even skin tone and brightening. And there's another laser that I did calledMeDioStar®, which is brightening and tightening. And then on top of that, I didPRP[platelet-rich plasma treatment]. And then I also didmicroneedlingand thensalmon DNA. It takes maybe an hour and a half to do.\"\nShe cautions:  \"The next day, if you get five to eight treatments, your skin will be slightly bruised, but it goes away within, I would say, 48 hours. [These lasers are] effective on the deeper surface level, but on the topical level, you can't really tell that you've gotten anything done… But then after I went home, and people were like, 'Wait, did you, did you do something to your face? ' And you're like, 'Okay, I think it's kicking in'.\"\nLim recommends visitors hit skin clinics at the beginning of their trip – \"first thing when they land… because these clinics like to check up on you after three-to-five days. During that downtime, you could do coffee and check out some incredible museums and do some shopping.\"\nWebsite:www.eunskin.co.kr/\nAddress: 88-37 Cheongdam-dong, Gangnam District, Seoul\nPhone: +82 2 546 3322\nInstagram:@eunskinclinic/\nAs part of her downtime from skin procedures, Lim also likes to indulge in relaxing body treatments.\n\"There's this spa calledGogyeol,\" says Lim. \"I love this place to reset my body. They do a traditional Korean massage and scrub.\"\nLike Eun Skin Clinic, Spa Gogyeol is found in Cheongdam; a two-minute walk from the Gangnam-Gu Office metro station. Lim notes that Spa Gogyeol is a not ajjimjilbang(a public Korean bathhouse). \"A lot of people love Korean bathhouses [because] they do this intensive scrub where they literally scrub off all the dead cells off your skin and it just comes purging off your body. It's pretty disgusting. But [Spa Gogyeol does] that treatment in a private setting, so you can get the body scrub, the upgrade massage and a detox wrap. They literally scrub off every dead skin cell on your body, and it just feels so soft. You feel like you're floating.\"\nSpa Gogyeol also offers a rich menu of holistic medical treatments, working with the body'sfive Tae energies. \"In Korean health, a lot of it is about balance,\" says Lim. \"So they'll really analyse your body to see what they need to focus on, and they'll customise it for you.\n\"I think a lot of people that are on holiday just want to relax,\" she adds. \"A lot of tired mamas. It's a very calming space.\"\nWebsite:https://spa-gogyeol.com/\nAddress: 3F&4F, 13, Seolleung-ro 132-gil, Gangnam-gu, Seoul, South Korea\nPhone: +82 10-7682-1297\nInstagram:@spa_gogyeol\nWhere Eun Skin Clinic is expressly high tech and Spa Gogyeol takes a holistic approach, Lim's next spa pick –Trinity Spain Seoul's Yongsan District –  is all about pampering and beautification.\n\"It's a little tricky with Trinity spa because their English isn't the best,\" says Lim. \"But I think they're working on it. They're more of a general spa; that's why I feel okay recommending it. They do everything from amazing facials, really focussing on lifting the face and focussing on your lines, and brightening and tightening to body contouring, massages. They cover it all.\"\nTrinity Spa's array of facial and body treatments toe the line between technology and relief – like the Real Jade Stone V-line jaw contour treatment or the lymphatic drainage leg massages – all administered in private guest rooms with cushy spa beds designed for ultimate relaxation.\n\"It's just a very relaxing experience for someone that wants a general spa experience,\" says Lim.\nWebsite:www.trinityspa.co.kr/\nAddress: 3rd floor, Taeseok Building 116 Dokseodang-ro, Hannam-dong, Yongsan District, Seoul\nPhone: +82-2-420-0797\nInstagram:@the_trinityspa_official/\nThe Korean skincare craze began in the early 2010s; global cosmetic purveyor Sephora's website now features aK-beauty sectionand Lim herself often providesK-beauty product recommendationson social media.\nSo when in Korea, shop as the Koreans do.\n\"Everyone needs to go toAmorepacific World Headquarters,\" declares Lim. Known as the inventor of thecushion foundation, Amorepacific now also owns many popular Korean skincare companies includingSulwhasoo,Innisfree,CosrxandLaneige. \"It's open to the public, which a lot of people don't know,\" says Lim. \"In their lobby, you can get your face scanned; a lot of people go there to get their cushion foundation customised… they have a beauty store in their lobby, so you can experience all of their brands at once. [There's also] an interactive Amorepacific store calledAMORE Seongsu. It's in this warehouse-y cement building; it's like you're walking through a store, but with a bathroom installation in front of you while you try things. Everything is technology-driven; you can get customised lip treatments, customised foundation. I could spend hours there.\"\nLim adds: \"There's also theSulwhasoo flagship store, which is just beautiful in itself.\"\nSulwhasoo, a luxury skin line, is headquartered in Seoul's upscale shopping district Sinsa-dong, in a modular structure channelling a golden lantern. \"The shopping is great, and it looks like you're entering an installation,\" says Lim. \"It has two spas. You could have, like, a foot scrub [or] a therapist with the singing bowl around your abdomen.\"\nLim also enjoys shopping for her favourite Korean brands at Olive Young. \"It's the Sephora of Korea,\" she says. \"They're on every corner. But the key thing is to know which one to go to. There'sone in Myeongdong, which is the largest. Then thenewest one is in Seongsuand it's a lot more tech-driven.\" Apart from beauty shopping, the five-storey Olive Young in Seongsu houses a cafe and a skin and scalp clinic as well as professional makeup services and a \"trend pod\" showroom. \"Olive Young can be slightly outdated depending which one you go to,\" says Lim. \"But this one feels like the future of what Olive Young will be.\"\nWebsite:https://www.apgroup.com/int/en/our-culture/amorepacific-space/amorepacific-headquarters/amorepacific-headquarters.html(Amorepacific World Headquarters)\nAddress: 100 Hangang-daero, Yongsan District, Seoul\nPhone: +82-2-604-05114\nInstagram:@amorepacificgroup.official/\nWebsite:https://www.amoremall.com/kr/ko/store/display?storeCode=001(Amorepacific Seongsu)\nAddress: 7 Achasan-ro 11-gil, Seongdong-gu, Seoul\nPhone: +82-2-469-8600\nWebsite:https://www.sulwhasoo.com/int/en/flagship/dosan/index.html(Sulwhasoo flagship)\nAddress: 18 Dosan-daero 45-gil, Sinsa-dong, Gangnam District, Seoul\nPhone: +82 2-541-9270\nInstagram:@sulwhasoo.official/\nWebsite:https://global.oliveyoung.com/(Olive Young Seongsu)\nAddress: 300-65 Seongsu-dong 2(i)-ga, Seongdong-gu, Seoul\nPhone:+82 2-461-5290\nInstagram:@oliveyoung_global/\nTo cap off a day of beauty, Lim heads straight for the hair salon. \"This is actually quite common in Korea,\" she says. \"After you get all your skin treatments, you go get your hair done.\"\nLim favoursABYBOM, a massive, three-storey salon on Seolleung-ro that boasts a client roster of Korean celebs likeSandara Park. \"A lot of people that go to events get the full service of hair and makeup done,\" says Lim. \"They do amazing cuts. They style, they detoxify your scalp, if needed. They're incredible.\"\nAfterwards, Lim always likes to visit a café. \"Café life in Korea is so major,\" she says. \"Between cafés and skin, you will never see the end of day.\" One of her favourite stops is inside the Dosan ParkGentle Monsterbranch; 35 minutes outside of Seoul proper. \"Gentle Monster is a sunglass brand; they have the coolest shops ever,\" says Lim. \"It's like an art installation. Then downstairs, there is a cafe calledNudake;they have conceptual coffees and baked goods.\"\nNudake Café proffers itscoffees and whimsical pastries on stark countertops, like modern art displays. \"It sounds so ridiculous, but they have these tiny, tiny, tiny, miniature croissants,\" says Lim. \"They're literally the size of your pinky nail bed, but it's so good, and it's just so fun to take a photo with. [And] they have incredible coffee. It's actually quite hard to find non-dairy milks, but they have non-dairy milk there. So that's personally the reason why I like to go to that café, to just get my lattes without dairy milk.\"\n\"There's a lot of things that we have been doing in Korea that I feel like the world is finally noticing,\" adds Lim. \"It's something that I'm very proud of.\"\nWebsite:www.abybom.com/\nAddress: 3층, 40 Seolleung-ro 152-gil, Gangnam District, Seoul\nPhone: + 82-2-516-8765\nInstagram:@abybom__official/reels/\nWebsite:https://nudake.com/en\nAddress: 26 Seongsui-ro 7-gil, Seongdong-gu, Seoul\nPhone: +82-7-041-284408\nInstagram:@nu_dake/\nBBC Travel'sThe SpeciaListis a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "Chef Ruben Bondì knows that Rome's Jewish restaurants serve some of the best food in the city. Here are his picks in the historic Jewish quarter.\nIn 2025, millions of pilgrims and tourists are flocking to Rome and the Vatican City, the historic seat of the Catholic Church,in honour of the Jubilee year. But less than a mile from St Peter's Basilica, Europe's oldest Jewish community is thriving – and continuing a rich culinary tradition dating back to when Jews first settled in Rome in the 2nd Century BCE.\nFor Ruben Bondì, an influencer chef and member of the city's Jewish community, thetradizione giudaico-romanesca(Judaeo-Roman tradition) is not just a subset ofRoman cuisine; it's one of its cornerstones.\n\"Jewish cuisine is the true Roman cuisine,\" says Bondì, famed for filming his cooking videos on his balcony in Rome's Monteverde neighbourhood. \"Our food is very poor and simple. But it's incredibly flavourful.\"\nDeveloped over the centuries and influenced by waves of Sephardic migration when Jews were exiled from Spain and Portugal over the 15th and 16th Centuries, Roman Jewish dishes are often fried and typically feature almonds, artichokes, sour cherries, cod and preserved fish. Among these are some of the Eternal City's most beloved recipes – expressly kosher yet iconic throughout largely Catholic Italy – fromcarciofi alla giudia(fried artichokes) tostracotto(braised pot roast). Today, they can be savoured in the string of Roman Jewish restaurants clustered near the southern banks of the Tiber River, in what was once the city's Jewish ghetto.\n\"Every family has their own recipe, their own way of making a dish,\" Bondì says. \"Food is a strong presence in my home. Every Friday, before Shabbat, my grandmother would prepare the same thing – typical [Jewish] dishes likeconcia di zucchine[marinated fried courgettes] andabbacchio[roasted lamb] with potatoes.\"\nBut behind the delicious recipes and family traditions is a tragic history. As a target of persecution throughout history – from 1st Century CE purges by Roman emperors Tiberius and Claudius to almost three centuries of ghetto confinement under Papal rule from 1555 to 1815 – Roman Jewish identity was forged in response to oppression, and its food is no exception.\n\"In the ghetto, Jews were forbidden from trading, and this influenced many of our dishes,\" Bondì says. \"Like how ricotta cheese is hidden in our tarts [so]the Pope's Guards wouldn't notice. Or our famous fish soup [brodo di pesce] made of sardines, was because we weren't allowed to buy prized fish, only anchovies and sardines.\"\nToday, Rome's former ghetto – sandwiched between heavily touristed landmarks like the Roman Forum and Campo de' Fiori marketplace – is a picturesque, lively Jewish quarter of meandering cobblestone alleyways, bakeries and restaurants, but it still emanates the joy and pain of its roots.\nHere are Bondì's top ways to savour Rome's hidden Jewish soul.\nLocated at the Jewish quarter's heart, near theTempio Maggiore synagogueandPorticus Octaviae– the 1st-Century BCE ruins of an ancient Roman portico that eventually became a fish market, and the neighbourhood's symbol –Ba'Ghettois just about as quintessentially Judaeo-Roman as it gets... with a twist.\n\"They do a mix of cuisines, a bit of everything,\" Bondì says. \"Jewish Roman, of course, but also Middle Eastern and Arab Israeli food.\"\nAmong its Roman Jewish staples iscarciofi alla giudia– a delicacy that balances both freshness and fried heartiness.\nThe restaurant's menu features Middle Eastern and North African Mizrahi dishes, like hummus, falafel, couscous, Tunisian binik, tabbouleh, lahmacun, kebab and baklava, as well as kosher takes on pork-based Roman pasta recipes likespaghetti alla carbonaraand bucatini all'amatriciana, made with dried beef.\n\"Their aim is to unite these [foreign] cuisines with the Jewish Roman tradition,\" Bondì says.\nBa'Ghetto, which opened in 2007 and abides by strict kosher rules, now has branches inVenice,FlorenceandMilan. Its main restaurant – a chic, minimalist eatery covered in Hebrew inscriptions and black-and-white pictures – does not serve any milk-based products, preparing its desserts with vegan alternatives. For dairy delicacies and desserts, you can try the nearbyBa'Ghetto Milky.\nWebsite:https://www.baghetto.com\nAddress: Via del Portico D'Ottavia, 57, 00186 / Via del Portico D'Ottavia 2/A (Ba'Ghetto Milky)Phone:  +39 06 9674 0389 / 06 6830 0077 (Ba'Ghetto Milky)\nInstagram:@baghettorestaurants/\nRoman food is simple and unfussy by nature and its Jewish variant is no exception; often best savoured on the go.\nSo when local institutionRenato al Ghetto– where Bondì worked as a waiter in his younger days – realised it could replicate its success with street food, its hole-in-the-wall \"Rosetteria\" was opened, serving the best of the Roman Jewish tradition in a bun.\n\"Rosetteare a type of Roman bap,\" Bondì says, referring to the popular rosebud-shaped bread with a distinctively crusty exterior and soft, fluffy heart; the perfect vehicle for hearty sandwich fillings. \"I'd recommend beefstracottoor Roman artichokes.\"\nAmong the other sandwich topping options at the takeout spot, squeezed between the neighbourhood's multitude of restaurants, are the tomato-braised chickenalla cacciatora, beef jerky, lemon escalope and even a sweet soy chocolate variant, all of which come in under €12 (£10).\n\"It's very good,\" Bondì says. \"I advise it for anyone who wants a quick meal.\"\nAddress: Via di S.

As with other restaurants in the area, BellaCarne has also dedicated itself to street food, and you can find take-out options and lunchboxes at their grab-and-go spot, BellaCarne Street Food.\nhttps://www.bellacarne.it\nAddress: Via del Portico d'Ottavia, 51, 00186\nPhone: +39 06 683 3104\n@bellacarne/\nThe dishes of Roman cuisine are famous throughout Italy for being hearty and expresslycasereccio –homestyle, homemade.\nCasalino, whose name evokes the warmth of the Italian lunch table, promises a cosy dining experience, and its oak floorings and earthy colours create an inviting ambiance.\n\"It's hearty, homey Jewish Roman food,\" Bondì says.\nThe restaurant was opened by the Zarfati family in 2021, after the opening of their successfulDolce Kosherbakery, and follows the recipes of the household matriarch, nonna Letizia.\nAmong its dishes are distinctive spins on local classics, such as salt-cured cod with tomatoes, pine nuts and raisins; butter and truffle tonnarelli pasta; and the must-have carciofi alla giudia. Bondì emphatically recommends Casalino's roasts, but notes that the Zarfati family tightly guards the recipe.\n\"It's a secret,\" he says.\nWebsite:https://casalinoosteriakosher.it\nAddress: Via del Portico d'Ottavia, 1e, 00186\nPhone number: +39 06 7978 1514\nInstagram:@casalino.osteriakosher/\nWhile most of the quarter's restaurants follow kosher food rules (including forbidding pork and the preparation of meat and dairy products together),Il Giardino Romanohas adapted the Roman Jewish culinary tradition for a secular palate.\n\"It's the only Roman Jewish restaurant that isn't kosher,\" Bondì says.\nAs its name suggests, Il Giardino Romano (\"The Roman Garden\") has a green thumb – its menu focuses heavily on vegetables, from chicory and courgettes to artichokes, which Bondì calls the restaurant's speciality.\nThe mighty artichoke is a recurring character in many of the restaurant's takes on traditional Italian and Roman Jewish dishes that don't typically warrant its use – fromfettuccinealle vongole(pasta with clams) tocacio e pepeto even more idiosyncratic pairings.\n\"[Il Giardino Romano] has a particularly unique dessert,\" Bondì says. \"A ricotta crostata with artichoke.\"\nAnd if the menu does not succeed in evoking the bucolic delights of the Roman orchard, its setting certainly will – the restaurant has a small brick courtyard covered in trees and hanging ivy.\nWebsite:https://www.ilgiardinoromano.com\nAddress: Via del Portico d'Ottavia 18, 00186\nPhone: +39 06 6880 9661\nInstagram:@ristorante_il_giardino_romano/\nBBC Travel'sThe SpeciaListis a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "Bangkok-born actor Dom Hetrakul plays a hotel spa therapist in The White Lotus season three. Here are his top tips for visiting Phuket, Koh Samui and Bangkok.\nSince its tourism boom in the mid-20th Century, Thailand has become synonymous with paradisical landscapes and top-notch hospitality. In recent years, however, the Southeast Asian country has risen beyond its reputation as a spiritual and adventure haven, partially due to acclaimedfilm productionsandinfluential namesdrawing attention to its unique culture.\nToday, the country's cultural influence has reached nearly every industry, fromfashiontosportstoentertainment. For a prime example, look no further than the highly anticipated third instalment of HBO's seriesThe White Lotus, which premiered 16 February 2025. Following successful stopovers in Hawaii and Italy, season three features Thailand as its latest lush backdrop for intrigue and social satire. The islands of Koh Samui and Phuket are the main filming locations (with a smattering of scenes shot in Bangkok), while an ensemble of Thai actors including Blackpink'sLisa Manobal,Patravadi Mejudhon,Tayme Thapthimthongand actor, model and businessmanDom Hetrakuljoin the star-studded cast.\n\"The series is a very deep and dark comedy so it's going to be fun when it comes to Thailand, which has a different background compared to Hawaii and Sicily,\" says Hetrakul, who plays Pornchai, the beatific hotel spa therapist at the Thai branch of the fictional White Lotus resort. \"We have strong values and beliefs influenced by our religious background, but we're still dynamic in a way. That might be something very distinctive when you get close to the Thai community [and why] everyone is looking at Thailand as one of the most famous destinations for tourism.\"\nHetrakul, who was born in Bangkok and calls the city home, balances his career in entertainment with a job in the motorcycle trading business. But his packed schedule has never stopped him from travelling and finding inspiration in his home country: \"Apart from acting, sports and motorcycles take me everywhere. To find inspiration you need to get out of your comfort zone, that [means] more places and people to meet.\"\nHere are Hetrakul's favourite places in Bangkok, Phuket and Koh Samui.\nHome to theFour Seasons Resort Koh Samuiwhere much of the season's hotel scenes were filmed,Koh Samuiis perhaps the ultimate White Lotusset-jettingdestination. Indeed, a good deal of the season's drama and privileged behaviour unfolds on the palm-laden island, located in the Gulf of Thailand.\nMost visitors arrive in Koh Samui via the Samui International Airport, but ferries and other means of transportation are available from Surat Thani Province. \"You can take a cruise about 45 minutes from the mainland,\" Hetrakul says.\nWhile its rugged coastline, majestic mountain ranges and long, sandy beaches make it a travel-worthy getaway, the island's wellness offerings have stimulated tourism in recent years; something keenly noted in season three, with the surprise return of fan-favourite spa manager Belinda (Natasha Rothwell) from The White Lotus season one, whose story arc involves learning Thai wellness techniques from Hetrakul's Pornchai so she can improve her practice in Maui.\nKoh Samui's luxurious spas, remote resorts and holistic health centres provide wellness and spiritual therapies and retreats for meditation, Ayurvedic treatments and massages, but Hetrakul suggests immersing yourself in yoga. \"In Koh Samui, they have a lot of different training experiences like Thai boxing and yoga,\" he says. \"But [I'd recommend] yoga by the beach every morning with yogis from around the world... That's a very healthy community.\"\nAddress: Ko Samui District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nThai people's love for food runs deep so no trip to Thailand is complete without indulging in the country's culinary delicacies. \"Over here, we eat all day, all night – daytime, office hours – we just order food and eat all the time,\" Hetrakul says. \"Restaurants have to open all day.\"\nWhile you'll have to watch the upcoming episodes to see the exact dishes and restaurants featured in The White Lotus season three, Koh Samui is packed with delicious food options from Western-style restaurants (Hetrakul likesSummer by Coco Tam,The ShackandGusto Italiano) to local eateries like Hetrakul's favourite island haunt,Jun Hom. The unassuming beachside spot is recognised for its seafood and homemade traditional dishes like pineapple fried rice, silver sillago fish andyum tua pu(wing bean salad). \"Everything is from the local fisherman's market,\" Hetrakul says, citing the Fisherman's Village Night Market, another go-to spot for foodies in Koh Samui – and rumoured to be the setting for some of season three's Songkran Festival shenanigans. \"Those aromatic herbs, spicy chillies and coconut milk on all sorts of fish, crabs, and prawns – you name it – Jun Hom makes [it].\"\nhttps://www.facebook.com/JunhomKohSamui\nAddress: 7/3 Mu 5, Mae Nam, Ko Samui, 84330\nPhone: +66 77 602 008\nWhether at exclusive high-voltage clubs or vibrant festivals by the ocean, Thailand's much-revered party scene lives up to the hype. Previews of season three offer glimpses at the White Lotus' take on Thai nightlife; neon lights, fireworks and dance performances spice up the intricate plot entanglements in thetrailer.\nHetrakul's top Thai party hotspot isKo Pha Nganisland, about 38km from Koh Samui – eagle-eyed viewers may have spotted Phangan Mantra Inn located near Ko Pha Ngan's Haad Rin Beach in the trailer's party scenes. \"[Koh Pha Ngan] is famous for theFull Moon Party,\" says Hetrakul, referring to the monthly festival-style beach parties that take over Haad Rin Beach every full Moon night or the day after. Locals and visitors celebrate by gathering around stages lined up across the shore for performances of various musical genres.\nFor those wary of big crowds – the parties attract thousands of attendants – Hetrakul has an insider tip. \"Now, people are trying to host more parties, they call them the Half Moon Parties,\" he says. \"Full Moon is more exposed to the public, so you expect the crowds, but Half Moon [celebrations] are less packed.\"\nAddress: Koh Phangan District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nAbout 30km north-west of Koh Samui lies theMu Ko Ang Thong National Marine Park, an enclave of 42 islands surrounded by turquoise sea. The archipelago's clear-water shores welcome The White Lotus guests, serving as a fitting introduction to Thailand's stunning seascapes.\nThough camping areas and bungalows are available onKo Wua Talap, the park's largest island,  Hetrakul recommends planning a day trip to the archipelago to explore luscious tropical forests, azure beaches and rugged landscapes apt for any type of visitor, from those seeking a calm, stress-free retreat to adventure enthusiasts. \"There are white-sand beaches and mountain ranges on the island itself, so you can enjoy a beach tour or hiking, depending on which of those small islands you prefer,\" says Hetrakul. \"[Ang Thong National Park is also] great for snorkelling, diving, kayaking, canoeing or camping.\" For wildlife lovers, if you're lucky enough, you may even come across cadres of cute-looking spectacled leaf monkeys.\nAddress: Koh Samui District, Surat Thani, Thailand\nConnected to the mainland via the 600m-long Sarasin Bridge, Phuket is Thailand's largest island. It's also home to various locations featured in The White Lotus season three, from the opulent Michelin Guide-recommendedTa Khairestaurant, where characters are seen dining (and whining), to theAnantara Mai Khao Phuketresort, whose lavish spa serves as a backdrop for the interactions between Hetrakul's Pornchai and Rothwell's Belinda.\n\"Phuket's [highlights] are the nightlife and the beach – Patong beach, the bars and clubs,\" Hetrakul says. However, those who venture beyond will be rewarded with splendid natural views and zealously protected greenery.\n\"About an hour's drive from Old Phuket Town, in the north of the island, there is a well-preserved mangrove forest calledBaan Tha Chatchai,\" the actor says. Here, community-based ecotourism is king; away from crowds, visitors can engage in activities such as kayaking and canoeing along shallow and still waterways. \"Deep in the jungle it's very calm, so you don't have to worry too much. [For example,] in the western part of Thailand, the waves are stronger, [but this is] a different current.\"\nLocal dishes such asmee hokkien(chewy egg noodles) or Phuket lobster top off an excursion to the area. \"They have a lot of restaurants around, some deep in the forest. It's very very traditional – truly local – food,\" Hetrakul emphasises. \"They have seafood, fresh vegetables and fruit. But to be warned, the food is mostly spicy.\"\nAddress: Within Phuket Marine National Park Operation Centre 2, 92/7 Moo 5 Mai Khao, Thalang, Phuket 83110\nThailand's cultural appeal doesn't stop at its beloved spicy food and notoriously wild festivals. For decades, sports, especially Muay Thai, have driven the country's soft power strategy; in early February, the Thai government launched a year-long campaign titledGrand Tourism and Sports Year 2025, aimed at leveraging the sports calendar to boost tourism. The national passion for Muay Thai is reflected in The White Lotus season three, as various characters chat about the fights and take in a match at Phuket's Bangla Boxing Stadium Paton.\nAs a sports enthusiast – he practices Muay Thai – Hetrakul encourages visitors to soak up Thailand's sports tradition and learn about its origins. \"We do lots of [sports but] Muay Thai, previously called Thai boxing, has become mainstream,\" he says. \"If you're a fan ofUFC (mixed martial arts) fights, most elite athletes are here for training. If they're talking about the striking, Muay Thai [has] one of the best striking techniques.\"\nWhile you can witness Thailand's most famous combat sport or book a class nearly anywhere in Thailand – \"there are a lot of Muay Thai camps around [the country],\" Hetrakul says – the actor recommends stopping by theRajadamnern Stadiumin his hometown of Bangkok. Located just a few blocks from the Wat Benchamabophit temple, Rajadamnern was Thailand's first venue uniquely dedicated to Muay Thai and was responsible for introducing the sports' official ranking system and rule book. The stadium is also recognised for its architecture and circular ring – the only one of its kind in the world.\nThe venue hosts combat every night, but Hetrakul advises visitors to get tickets for Friday and Saturday when the most anticipated clashes are generally scheduled.\nhttps://rajadamnern.com/\nAddress: 8 Ratchadamnoen Nok Rd, Pom Prap Sattru Phai, Bangkok 10100\n@rajadamnern_stadium\nProminently featured in season three's storyline, Thai wellness and healing practices need no introduction. Nuad Thai, or Thai massage, for example, was inscribed in 2019 onUnesco's List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. This manual therapy, aimed at realigning a person's body and energy, is one of Thailand's most popular and widespread cultural attractions; Hetrakul's Pornchai even performs Nuad Thai on Rothwell's Belinda when showing her his \"signature treatment.\"\nThe Buddhist templeWat Pho, credited as thebirthplace of Nuad Thai, is Hetrakul's recommendation to experience and learn about Thai massage. The complex, which houses Bangkok's largest reclining Buddha, was the city's first public education centre. Inside, the walls document centuries of knowledge on Thai healing techniques with a series of engraved marble slabs dated to the 19th Century.\nAs home to theWatpho Thai Traditional Medicine School, today the temple lures visitors interested in undergoing massage therapy. \"It's a place [to receive] traditional Thai massage,\" says Hetrakul. \"[But] they can [also] certify you with the approval of the Ministry of Health. You just need time to apply if you're interested in traditional Thai massage.\"\nhttps://www.watpomassage.com/EN/about\nAddress: 392 / 33-34 Soi Pen Phat 1, Grand Palace, Maharat Road Phra Nakhon district, Bangkok 10200\n*This article, originally published on 26 February 2025, provides a companion to fans tuning into the Season 3 finale on 6 April.\nBBC Travel'sThe SpeciaListis a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "Oracle Red Bull Racing's driver Yuki Tsunoda talks us through the must-see places in Tokyo ahead of his home race at the Japanese Grand Prix.\nWheneverYuki Tsunodareturns to fast and furious Tokyo after months of (literally) racing around the globe, it's the city's bountiful food options that help remind him he's home.\n\"When I'm back I always make a detailed plan of where I'm going to eat,\" declares the young Red Bull driver; known for being one of Formula 1's biggestfoodies. \"On every single street and every single block there are so many great restaurants. The competition for food is so high as currently Tokyo has thehighest concentration of Michelin star restaurants in the world.\nA native of Sagamihara city, around 47km south-west of Tokyo, Tsunoda – who now lives in Milan, Italy – heads straight to Tokyo whenever he's back in Japan.  \"Even when I return to Japan now, which happens around three times a year, I normally stay in Tokyo,\" he says. \"That's where I can do business, enjoy the food and experience the nightlife. It's always so fun to be back there.\"\nEach April, Tsunoda's return to Tokyo is particularly triumphant when he races in his home Grand Prix. For Tsunoda, what separates the Japanese Grand Prix from the other tracks is the scintillating and contagious atmosphere, which he insists he \"can feel in the car\". Every time Tsunoda emerges at the Suzuka Circuit, he's greeted with a tidal wave of cheers and support that only increases when he's in the car and racing around the circuit.\nThe excitement was particularly vibrant at the2024 Japanese Grand Prix, when he finished 10th to become the first Japanese drive to score points since 2012. \"As soon as I got out of the car, I could see so many people were happy,\" he says. \"With that kind of support, you just feel like a hero. You also feel extra pressure too, and responsibility. But it's a special feeling.\"\nAfter the race, Tsunoda had no shortage of ways to celebrate. As the world's most populous metropolitan area, home to more than 41 million residents as of 2024, Tokyo is constantly abuzz with energy and excitement. Visitors (and locals) get lost in its bustling markets and bask in its futuristic, neon-lit shopping and nightlife sectors, while the city's many parks, gardens and ancient temples mean there's also room for contemplation and self-reflection.\nHere are Tsunoda's top ways to enjoy Tokyo – off the grid.\nThe city now known as Tokyo began life as asmall fishing village called Edo, inhabited since ancient times. Today, its centuries of rich history are proudly on display in its captivating backdrop of modern skyscrapers set against historic temples. Each of the city's 23 wards offers unique sights – like youthful, trendy Shibuya with its iconic \"scramble\" street crossing; and Ginza, lined with elegant luxury boutiques.\nWhen Tsunoda wants to soak up Tokyo's modern-meets-ancient scenery, he heads toAsakusa, a serene neighbourhood known for its traditional charm and for being one of Tokyo's main geisha districts. \"If you want to see the traditional side in Japan, theSensō-ji templeis so nice,\" says Tsunoda. Known for its majestic Hozomon Gate, Sensō-ji is the oldest temple in Tokyo; a five-storey pagoda and Buddhist place of worship that instantly transports you to 7th-Century Japan. Visitors to Asakusa can also stroll down Nakamise-dori; one of Japan's oldest shopping streets.\nAnd for a mile-high view of the city, Tsunoda suggests visitingTokyo Skytree. The tallest freestanding tower in the world at 634m, Tokyo Skytree offers stunning, all-encompassing views of Tokyo and beyond. \"It's the highest building in Tokyo and you can see the whole city from there,\" says Tsunoda. Visitors can also enjoy the mammoth tower's 300-plus shops and restaurants. Reserving a ticket in advance is strongly recommended to avoid queues.\nhttps://www.senso-ji.jp/english/\nAddress: 2 Chome-3-1 Asakusa, Taito City, Tokyo 111-0032Phone: +81 3-3842-0181\nhttps://tokyo-skytree.net/\nAddress: 1 Chome-1-2 Oshiage, Sumida City, Tokyo 131-0045, Japan\nPhone: +81 570-550-634\nhttps://www.instagram.com/tokyoskytree_official\nWhenever he's in Tokyo, Tsunoda always hitsOsoba no Kougain Minato City for their soba (buckwheat) noodles. Helmed by Hiroshi Kouga – who has been making soba for more than 20 years – the elegant space remains one of Tokyo's most affordable Michelin-starred soba noodle shops.\nTsunoda also insists that visitors try wagyu steak when they're in Tokyo. Translating to \"Japanese cow\", wagyu is globally regarded as premium beef for its flavour and tenderness, made rich and juicy by the distinctive marbling pattern of fat. Tsunoda insists, \"Wagyu just tastes different when it's from a cow fed in Japan.\"\nTsunoda's favourite place to enjoy wagyu steak isUkai-Teiin the upscale Ginza district, lauded for its opulent mixture of Art Noveau and Japanese design. Watching its chefs prepare dishes on a teppan grill adds to the entertainment factor.\nhttps://osobanokouga.com/\nAddress: 2-14-5 Nishiazabu, Minato-ku, Tokyo 106-0031\nPhone Number: +81 3-3797-6860\nSeafood is a staple in Japanese cuisine, taking the starring role in dishes from traditional breakfasts of grilled fish and rice to delicious, rainbow-coloured sushi.\nFor the best fish in town, Tsunoda heads toTsukiji Outer Market, locally known as Japan's \"Food Town\". Located next to the historicTsukiji Marketwhere the city's famous tuna auctions were held for decades, the lively market is crammed with stalls selling the freshest seafood. Some of the city's most famous restaurants come here to get their fish, but the market is also packed to the brim with hole-in-the-wall spots where you can snack on some of Japan's most famous foods, liketamagoyaki(omelette on a stick),mochi(glutinous rice cake) and wagyu beef skewers. It's also where Tsunoda says you can find some of Tokyo's best sushi.\n\"There are many sushi restaurants at Tsukiji Outer Market,\" he says. \"And since it is a fish market, the fish is very fresh, especially in the morning when you can enjoy it right there… It's just really great to watch people, walk around the fish market and soak up the atmosphere.\"\nhttps://www.tsukiji.or.jp/english/\nAddress: 104-0045 Tokyo, Chuo City, Tsukiji\nPhone number: +81 3-3541-9444\n@tsukijicity\nWith scores of luxury and indie boutiques, Tokyo is a shopper's paradise – and there are a variety of areas that cater to Tsunoda's eclectic tastes. \"I go toHarajukuwhen I want more street-style fashion that younger people wear. There's a lot there,\" he says. Located just east of Shibuya, Harajuku – known as Japan's top fashion district – is full of colourful street art, while its mass of clothing and cosplay stores, hip bars and alluring dessert shops means it's constantly buzzing with youthful vigour.\nTsunoda's first port of call in Harajuku isGR8, which is home to many of the city's up and coming designers, selling popular clothes and footwear from the US and Europe. Its neon interior and wooden entrance makes it one of the most distinct shops in the city, too. But if Tsunoda is after vintage fashion, he heads to theShimokitazawaneighbourhood, regarded as one of Tokyo's most bohemian areas, full of music venues, cafes and clothing stores. \"That's where you'll find more casual stuff,\" he says. When in Shimokitazawa, Tsunoda shops atBABEstore, a used and vintage clothing shop where you can easily spend hours looking for lost gems amidst its mass of items.\nFor luxury clothes shopping, Tsunoda suggests the very fashionableOmotesandodistrict, sometimes referred to as the Champs-Elysees of the city. \"That's where you get the brand stuff,\" he says. \"The items that are higher in price and where the most famous brands are.\"\nTsunoda likes jumping from store to store in the Tadao Ando-designedOmotesando Hillsshopping complex. Home to high-end designer boutiques and imports from across the world, there's also the occasional vintage store and fine dining option, too.\nhttps://www.gr8.jp\nAddress: 4 Chome-12-10 Jingumae, Shibuya, Tokyo 150-0001\nPhone: +81 3-3408-6908\n@________gr8\nThe one drinking establishment Tsunoda always tries to frequent when he's in town is Bar Centifolia, located in the laid-back Azabu Juban neighbourhood; home to embassies as well as a smattering of bars and restaurants.\nThe tiny bar has an exclusive, intimate feel with just 12 seats, and its theatrical bartenders have earned the spot a reputation for doubling as a performance space — tipplers will witness staff ferociously throwing bottles into the air, using liquid nitrogen and blue fire to create a specific taste and even chopping ice with a katana.\n\"Its bartender Yuzo Komai recently went viral because of the drinks that he makes,\" says Tsunoda. \"A lot of famous people have started going there. A lot of tourists, too. But it's such a nice bar.\" Komai's attention to detail when making cocktails, mixing each drink with surgical precision, recently saw him land theSuntory Cocktail Award Champion, one of the most coveted bartender prizes in the city.\nAddress: 6F, 1-6-5 Azabu-Juban, Minato-ku\nPhone Number: +81 3-3478-6228\n@bar_centifolia\nBBC Travel'sThe SpeciaListis a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "The musician, producer and Real Housewives: Atlanta breakout star loves her hometown. Here are her top local picks, from brunch at Toast to people watching at the Beltline.\nAtlanta – the state capital of Georgia and the unofficial capital of the American South – started its life as arailroad terminusin 1837 and has served as a hub for American culture ever since.\nRanking among thetop cities for US tourism, Atlanta consistently draws visitors with its dynamic contemporary art scene and iconic soul food, as well as its abundance of greenery and sprawlinghistoric estates. One of the main epicentres of thehip hop industry, it has also secured its place in music history, nurturing a long line of homegrown talent – likeKandi Burruss, the Atlanta-born singer, songwriter, producer and star ofThe Real Housewives of Atlanta.\nThe future songstress was raised in the Atlanta suburb of East Point, where she attended Tri-Cities High School of Visual and Performing Arts and met the other members of R&B girl groupXscape; later going on to co-write the 1993 hit No Scrubs for TLC. Burruss joined the Real Housewives of Atlanta cast for its sophomore season in 2010, becoming a fan favourite and one of the longest-tenured housewives before leaving the show in 2024. Her latest venture takes her to New York City as she and her husband, Todd Tucker, co-produce the new Broadway production ofOthello at the Barrymore Theatre, starring Academy Award winners Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal.\nBut Burruss is an Atlanta girl through and through. \"I was born and raised in Atlanta, so I am Atlanta,\" she says. \"This is home base for me.\"\nHer time on Real Housewives allowed her to celebrate her Atlanta roots, and chronicled meeting her husband and the birth of her son, Ace. \"It's been kind of cool to say I can go back and watch 14 years of my life,\" she says. \"It was a great experience.\"\nCameras followed Burruss and her co-stars as they crisscrossed the city to attend fashion shows; local restaurants, like 80-year-oldMary Mac's Tea Room; and major landmarks like theGeorgia Aquarium, which set the scene for one of the show's beloved end-of-season reunions.\nBurruss owns various enterprises in town, includingtworestaurantsand her business campThe Kandi Factory HQ(\"You have to have an invite,\" she says), which put her at the heart of Atlanta's often over-the-top social scene.\n\"Atlanta is a vibe,\" she declares. \"It’s a great place for work, fun, and the weather hits all four seasons; it’s such a place to be.\"\nHere are Burruss's favourite ways to experience her hometown of Atlanta.\nIf visitors are looking to drop some major coin, Burruss isn't against hitting up some of the most recognisable spots in Atlanta.\n\"People always go toLenox [Square]orPhipps [Plaza]if they want to shop,\" she says.\nBoth malls are in the city's upscale Buckhead neighbourhood and include the designer labels that Burruss and her co-stars wear on the show, like Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Dior. TheWaldorf Astoria Atlanta Buckheadand theInterContinental Buckhead Altantahotels, both located nearby, played host to the Real Housewives of Atlanta for various events, like Nene Leakes'sweddingin 2013.\nWebsite:https://www.simon.com/mall/lenox-square/\nAddress: 3393 Peachtree Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30326\nPhone: +14042336767\nInstagram:@lenoxsqmall\nWebsite:https://www.simon.com/mall/phipps-plaza\nAddress: 3500 Peachtree Rd NE, Atlanta, GA 30326\nPhone: +14042620992\nInstagram:@shopphippsplaza\nAtlanta has 53 restaurants listed in theMichelin Guide(and eateries likeFishmongerandStaplehousehave taken top spots on Bon Appétit'sBest New Restaurantslistingsin recent years), but diners can also enjoy the city's iconic Southern dishes like fried chicken atThe Busy Bee Cafeand peach cobbler atMs Ruby's Peach Cobbler Caféin Buckhead.\nAnyone looking to refuel after a late night or keep the party going after a big celebration can opt for brunch; another reality TV standby. While Burruss famously doesn't imbibe, she's happy to recommend her favourite spot.\n\"If I wanted to get up and go to brunch, it's a place calledToast. They have a great brunch,\" Burruss says of the trendy eatery, found just outside of Atlanta's Buckhead neighbourhood. \"The food is really good.\"\nVisitors can feast on \"New American Brunch\" dishes like strawberry-shortcake French toast or fried catfish and grits, while fans of Real Housewives will recognise the restaurant as the spot where Burruss feuded with her co-star Marlo Hampton at Shereé Whitfield'sKeepin' it Gucci brunchin 2023.\nWebsite:https://www.toastonlenoxatl.com/\nAddress: 2770 Lenox Rd Suite B-1, Atlanta, GA 30324\nPhone: +14047484594\nInstagram:@toastonlenox\nAs Burruss knows, getting a group of girlfriends together is no easy feat. So she looks for venues with good vibes and good music to accompany any tea that might get spilled (gossip) when she and her girls get together.\n\"My friend Rasheeda owns a place calledFrost Bistro. We might hang out there, because they play good music,\" Burruss says. Fans of reality TV may also remember the restaurant from VH1's Love & Hip Hop Atlanta.Rasheeda and Kirk Frost, who have headlined the show since 2012, opened the casual Southern-style bistro back in 2020, offering a breakfast and brunch menu full of inventive cocktails and modern, stick-to-your-ribs Georgia-style dishes.\n\"I like the oxtail and grits, the snapper and the French toast,\" says Burruss.\nWebsite:https://frostbistro.com/\nAddress: 281 Peters St SW, Atlanta, GA 30313\nPhone: +14049635495\nInstagram:@frostbistro\nAtlantic Stationis a favourite for locals and tourists, thanks to its views, restaurants and family-friendly attractions.\nThe building was once a steel mill and has since been transformed into a collection of boutiques, eateries and apartments. Its location between Atlanta's West Side, Home Park and South Buckhead makes it easy for visitors to get to no matter where they're coming from.\n\"You want to go to Atlantic Station. They always have a lot of kids hanging out and playing,\" Burruss says. \"I just took my son and his friends to Skyline Park at Ponce City Market. [They] have great restaurants in that building and on the rooftop is where Skyline Park is. So, you get an amazing view of the city.\"\nJust 15 minutes from Atlantic Station,Skyline Parkincludes a miniature golf course, a three-storey slide, and Heege Tower, which gives riders a 360-degree view of Bucktown, Midtown and downtown Atlanta.\nWebsite:https://atlanticstation.com/\nAddress: 1380 Atlantic Dr NW, Atlanta, GA 30363\nPhone: +14049007900\nInstagram:@atlanticstation\nIn a past life, Atlanta'sBeltlinewas a rail corridor that circled the city.

    "content": "Nienke Panis-Ringersma has made a career out of following the region's famous blooms. Here are her favourite ways to experience the season, from road trips to bulb picking.\nFew images are as indelible as the sight of candy-coloured tulips bursting through the dark winter ground. But in the Netherlands – the world's largest exporter of the magical bloom – venerating tulips is a way of life. In the weeks leading from icy winter to spring, rows of flowers stud the country's landscape in technicolour streaks, most famously in the Bollenstreek \"Bulb Region\", stretching between the towns of Haarlem and Leiden, arching towards the North Sea. And with tulips come tourists; eager to experience the blooms for themselves.\nWe spoke to Nienke Panis-Ringersma, the lens behind the popular Dutch-based tulip photography blog,Tulips in Holland, to find the best tulip bloom experiences in the Netherlands. \"People in the Netherlands are very down to earth,\" says Panis-Ringersma, whose images and tulip facts receive thousands of likes per month onFacebook. \"They are quite used to the flower fields. You know when it's tourist season, because the roads are clogged with people on a bike who are not used to riding bikes.\"\nNonetheless, Panis-Ringersma adores her nation's iconic bulb flower – enough to have made it her career. \"I think it's the excitement,\" she says. \"It starts around December when we can buy tulips in the florist shops. And around the third weekend of January, we celebrateNational Tulip Day. Around 300,000 tulips are placed on the museum square in Amsterdam with a beautiful backdrop of theRijksmuseumor theVan Gogh Museum. It's the start of many tulip festivals leading up to the start of spring. It's a magical place and I love the flower, the fragrance. Every tulip is unique. There is a great story to tell.\"\nHere are Nienke Panis-Ringersma's favourite ways to experience tulip season in the Netherlands.\n1. Best overall: Keukenhof\n\"So, you ask for absolutely number one place? VisitKeukenhof,\" says Panis-Ringersma.\nEstablished in 1949, Keukenhof Gardens is undoubtedly the most popular tulip experience in the Netherlands; its lushly landscaped \"inspirational\" tulip gardens and windmills drawing over a million visitors each year during its eight-week season. \"Around 7 million bulbs are planted by hands, not by machine, every year,\" says Panis-Ringersma, whose budding love for tulips was ignited by childhood visits to Keukenhof, where her grandfather volunteered as a ticket taker. \"It's the most beautiful spring garden in the world.\"\nVisitors enjoy a wide variety of experiences at Keukenhof including picnics, flower exhibitions and didactic \"whisper boat\" cruises through the gardens, where contemporary art sculptures dot the grounds. But plan ahead; Keukenhof is open for just two months, usually from the first day of Spring to the first week of May, depending on the weather (in 2025, 20 March to 11 May). \"The best time to go is the $1m question,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"It's different every year… right now we have an extremely warm winter. I think the best time to visit for this year is around the middle of April.\"\nWebsite:https://keukenhof.nl/en/\nAddress: Stationsweg 166A 2161 AM Lisse\nContact: info@keukenhof.nl\nInstagram:@visitkeukenhof\n2. Best cultural experience: Catching the Bloemencorso Flower Parade\nTo truly get swept up in the excitement of tulip season, be sure to catch theBloemencorsoFlower Parade.\n\"A flower parade is a very festive flower festival,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"It's about 20 different floats, marching bands, cars very lavishly decorated with all kinds of flowers, people enjoying themselves, street entertainment… every town is a very festive atmosphere.\"\nThe Bloemencorso parade takes place each year on the third Saturday of April, marching along the road from Noordwijk to Haarlem, through the Bollenstreek and past Keukenhof. \"It's a full day,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"People line up at least three four lines thick to see. Some people get their seats ready at least three hours before the parade to make sure… it's like a Disney parade. People are sitting down on the streets waiting for the parade to pass by.\"\nPanis-Ringersma's tip: watch from Noordwijk. \"Lots of people try to see the parade around Keukenhof because it passes the gardens,\" she says. \"But that's an extremely busy spot. Go to Noordwijk early in the morning. It's a beautiful seaside town.\"\nWhile waiting for the parade, feast on Dutch Stroopwafel cookies, or have lunch at Panis-Ringersma's casual Dutch dining pick,Hudson Restaurant. \"It's a very festive day,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"Every town is having markets … it's an absolute must-see for people traveling to the Netherlands.\"\nWebsite:https://bloemencorso-bollenstreek.nl/en/\nPhone: +31 (0)252 428 237\nInstagram:@bloemencorsobollenstreek\n3. Best interactive experience: Visiting a tulip farm\nFor those who aren't satisfied merely admiring the blooms from afar, Panis-Ringersma suggests visiting a tulip farm. \"Because everybody really wants to go into the fields, which is not allowed,\" she says. \"So, please go to a tulip farm where it is allowed!\"\nPanis-Ringersma's three farm recommendations are all found in the heart of the Bollenstreek. \"All three are founded by bulb growers,\" she says. \"So, they know absolutely what they are doing. They're all a very hands-on experience.\"\nThe family-runTulip Experiencein Noordwijkerhout is Panis-Ringersma's first pick; home to nearly 1 million tulips. \"You can go to the field where you can see at least 700 different types of tulips,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"You can visit the tulip market with all kinds of products made of tulips or with tulips on it. You can pick your own tulips. It's a very fun experience.\" What sort of tulip products? \"Beer with tulips, tulip vodka, tulipAperol Spritz, soap smelling of tulips, vases, napkins with tulips, wallets with tulips,\" she says. \"If you can name it, everything with tulips.\"\nAlternatively, visitTulip Barnin Hillegom just 30 minutes outside of Amsterdam, where visitors can immerse themselves in the 750,000 tulips sprawling across the farm's gardens and production field. \"They are more focused on making Instagrammable photos,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"So, for a bit younger target audience.\"\nHeading further south, Panis-Ringersma also likesDe Tulperijin Voorhout. \"You can go together with the bulb grower,\" she says. \"You're walking into the fields. He will dig up some tulip bulbs and will show you how they are growing and what they are doing each year to make them grow. It's a very interesting environment.\"\nWebsite:https://tulipexperienceamsterdam.nl\nAddress: Delfweg 37, 2211 VK Noordwijkerhout, Netherlands\nPhone: +31651368784\nInstagram:@tulipexperienceamsterdam\n4. Best for kids: Tulip picking\nFor visitors with antsy kids (and a car), Panis-Ringersma loves tulip picking in the Bollenstreek. \"Not in the regular fields where you can say as you're walking, 'Oh, I like this one!'\" she says. \"No, just go to a to a picking farm and pick your own tulips.\"\nThere are several picking farms in the Bollenstreek area, but Panis-Ringersma recommends heading toAnnemieke's Pluktuin, a tulip nursery in Hillegom run by husband-and-wife team, Annemieke and Pieter. \"Pluktuinis literally 'picking garden',\" explains Panis-Ringersma. \"Tulip picking is an absolutely brilliant experience, especially when you go with children to walk into the field and get the tulip with the bulb and you can take the bulb and the tulip with you back home or to the hotel.\"\nWebsite:https://www.annemiekespluktuin.nl\nAddress: Haarlemmerstraat 15A, 2182 HA Hillegom, Netherlands\nPhone: +31653839979\nInstagram:@pickinggardenholland\n5. Best for tulip aficionados: Hortus Bulborum\nFor Panis-Ringersma, whose passion for tulip photography led her to become an expert in tulip horticulture, theHortus Bulborumhistorical bulb garden in Limmen is a sacred institute of learning.\n\"It's like a living museum,\" she says. \"Tulips entered the Netherlands around the 16th Century. And people loved them from the very beginning. And right now, there is one place in the Netherlands that keep the bulbs alive from the 16th Century and later on. So, this is a place where you can visit and find the oldest bulbs of the Netherlands still blooming.\"\nThe Hortus Bulborum houses more than 4,500 varieties of historical spring bulbous plants, from tulips to daffodils to hyacinths, which are rarely cultivated in modern day. The garden's star bulbs include a specimen of Fritillaria Persica, dating to 1557, and the ancient 16th-Century tulip Duc van Tol Red and Yellow.\n\"So, you can visit and it's a very small garden,\" says Panis-Ringersma. \"They have great apple pie! So absolutely visit and drink some coffee with apple pie over there and have a look at all the different kinds of flowers.\"\nWebsite:https://hortus-bulborum.nl/en/\nAddress: Zuidkerkenlaan 23A, 1906 AC Limmen, Netherlands\nPhone: +31617291643\nFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/hortusbulborum/\nThis article was originally published 31 March 2024 and has been updated to reflect the 2025 opening and closing dates for Keukenhof Gardens.\nBBC Travel'sThe SpeciaListis a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\nIf you liked this storysign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "Alberto Angela has made a career out of exploring his hometown. Here are his favourite spots to unearth Rome's millennia of secrets, from the Vatican Museums to Ostia Antica.\nFrom the 1st-Century BCE ruins of the Imperial Forum to the Trevi Fountain’s Baroque splendour, Rome packs such an overwhelming myriad of postcard-worthy landmarks that digging through its historical layers can make any visitor feel like they've turned into an archaeologist.\nAlberto Angela, a TV presenter, global ambassador for Italian heritage, art, history and culture, and a familiar face in Italian living rooms for nearly four decades knows a thing or two about his hometown's 2,000 years of history – and he's ready to help visitors discover it, especially as this year'sJubileenewly puts it into the limelight.\n\"Rome has two faces,\" says Angela. \"The Papal – that of the rich – and its working-class soul, the one that is closest to us… the most interesting,\" he says.\nIn a city where grand basilicas lie next to shady alleyways, Angela recommends exploring without cramming in too many sights – so that one can \"immerse oneself in the world of the ancients\".\nHaving followed in the footsteps of his famous father, Piero Angela – Italy's most well-known documentarist often called a \"national treasure\" – the younger Angela attributes his career and love of history to growing up in the Italian capital.\n\"You breathe history here,\" he says. \"Anyone who comes to Rome can see the same afterglow Caesar would have seen. You aren't in a place that doesn't exist anymore. Rome was rebuilt on top of its ancient structures.\"\nFor Angela, this is what makes Rome so unique. \"The city did not cancel its history, unlike many others,\" he says. \"Living here, you understand the ancients.\"\nEmerging from a small market settlement on the Tiber, the city of Rome was at an intersection between the Mediterranean and mainland Europe, making it a crossroads that swelled into the world’s first true metropolis. Angela believes that the city's immense global-reaching political and symbolic impact throughout history means everyone has a \"piece\" of Rome inside them – which is why it can have such a profound impact on those who visit it.\nHere are Angela's favourite ways to experience ancient history in modern Rome.\nMuch of central Rome's labyrinthine urban grid is a direct heir of the former imperial capital, with public spaces like the Baroque Piazza Navona or Campo de’ Fiori piazza taking their shape from a bygone stadium and theatre, respectively.\nBut on thePalatine Hill, the mythical birthplace of Rome, you can actually walk on the same stones where emperors Augustus and Nero once dwelled.\n\"It's the place where the Caesars lived and died,\" Angela says.\nAs the legend goes, twin brothers Romulus and Remus received an omen from the gods and decided to lay the foundations of a new city on the Palatine Hill in 753 BCE. In the subsequent centuries, the Palatine developed into an exclusive neighbourhood of patrician villas and Imperial palaces – indeed, it’s where the word “palace” takes its root.\nOne of the legendary seven hills of the ancient city, offering an incomparable vantage point with a 360 panorama, Palatine Hill offers what Angela describes as \"a beautiful walk\", with arguably the best views of the Colosseum – the unmistakable \"star of ancient Rome\".\nVisiting the Palatine is a full immersion into the life of the Roman empire, with a plethora of impressive ruins, including the mosaic floors of Augustus's palace, Domitian's hippodrome and the balcony overlooking the Circus Maximus racecourse.\nWebsite:https://colosseo.it/en/area/the-palatine/\nAddress: Parco archeologico del Colosseo, Via di S. Gregorio 30, 00186\nPhone: + 39 06 21115 843\nInstagram: @parcocolosseo\nAs the centre of Catholicism and one of the most important sites in Christendom, the Unesco-listed Vatican is firmly entrenched among Rome's unmissable sights. In honour of the 2025 Jubilee, tourists and pilgrims alike are flocking toSaint Peter's Basilicato walk through its Holy Door, opened for the occasion every quarter of a century.\nBut while much of the Holy See's architectural majesty is immediately apparent – from the Michelangelo- and Giacomo della Porta-designed designed dome of Saint Peter's all the way to the Sistine Chapel and Vatican Museums – some of its greatest treasures are hidden underground.\n\"Once in Saint Peter's, you walk on beautiful marble floorings, you look up to the Baldachin,\" says Angela, renowned for his 2015 TV miniseries Alla Scoperta dei Musei Vaticani (Discovering the Vatican Museums). \"But you can go underground. The Popes' tombs can be found underneath, but under those is the ancient Roman graveyard where Peter the Apostle himself was buried. The foundations of [the Basilica] are a graveyard.\"\nThe Vatican Necropolis, excavated only in the 1940s, features mausoleums belonging to citizens of many faiths, as well as a cluster of tombs called \"Field P”, suspected by some scholars to hold the burial chamber of the Church founder himself.\n\"It's a trip into ancient Rome that you wouldn't expect to find [there]\", Angela says. \"It makes you understand how Rome really is.\"\nVisitors must book visits to the Necropolis on the official website of Saint Peter’s Basilica. The dress code mandates covered shoulders and below-the-knee clothing.\nWebsite:https://www.basilicasanpietro.va/en/san-pietro/the-necropolis\nAddress: Piazza San Pietro, 00120 Città del Vaticano, Vatican City\nPhone: +39 06 6988 5318\nInstagram: @basilicasanpietro.va\nRome has more than 900 Catholic sites of worship built over the course of the centuries. Now and then, there's one that best encapsulates the city's multi-millennial history, like Angela's pick, theBasilica of San Clemente.\n\"This Basilica conceals the three souls of Rome – Baroque, medieval and ancient,\" Angela says. \"Anyone who comes across it is enchanted.\"\nTucked behind the Colosseum and a composite of two different churches, San Clemente – dedicated to the third pope of the same name – has been a site of worship since ancient Roman times, when it served as a temple for the Zoroastrian cult of Mithras.\nThe temple eventually swelled into its grand current form, featuring an intricate overlay of architectural styles – from its Renaissance courtyard and the Mannerist facade of the main Basilica, all the way to its underground, early medieval second structure, which hides ancient Roman remnants.\n\"The exterior is beautiful and well-maintained, from the 16th Century, with a Cosmatesque [geometric] marble flooring, and then you take the stairs and arrive at the medieval Basilica,\" says Angela. \"And you find yourself right in ancient Rome, in a Roman temple.\"\nWebsite:https://www.basilicasanclemente.com/eng/\nAddress: Piazza di S. Clemente, 00184\nPhone: +39 06 774 0021\nInstagram: @sanclementeroma\nFrom 17th-CenturyVilla Borgheseto theCapitoline, the city’s oldest art gallery, Rome has no shortage of museums displaying a vast array of artefacts – matched by equally colossal crowds of spectators.\nWhile Angela certainly recommends visitors enjoy the time-worn classics, he also suggests a quieter, quirkier alternative:the Museo della Comunicazione Scritta dei Romani.\nConveniently located a mere five-minute walk from the Termini train station, the museum is found inside the Baths of Diocletian, where the majestic 4th-Century Imperialtermaehave survived in remarkable condition. It is also home to a curious collection of esoteric Roman artefacts, showing how the ancients dabbled in the occult.\n\"It's a museum dedicated to how Romans expressed themselves,\" Angela says. \"But there's a part dedicated to magic, voodoo of sorts.\"\nSuperstition was the unspoken crux of ancient Roman life, but one that we often overlook. \"It's a world that often gets left behind, that of spiritual beliefs,\" he adds. \"They found the objects in a parking lot.\"\nAmong the objects on display is a large copper cauldron, curse tablets (defixiones), ritual tools and even Christian spells.\n\"For someone coming from the station, especially if it rains, it's quite an intriguing thing to visit,\" says Angela.\nWebsite:https://museonazionaleromano.beniculturali.it/terme-di-diocleziano/il-museo-della-comunicazione-scritta-dei-romani/\nAddress: Viale Enrico de Nicola 78, 00185\nPhone: +39 06 684 851\nInstagram: @museonazionaleromano\nThe 16th to 18th Centuries were a crucial time for Rome's urban development, as the city's aristocratic families – including the Farnese, Borghese, Doria and Pamphilj – vied for social dominance through commissioning lavish building projects, all designed in the Baroque style favoured by the Papal Counter-Reformation.\n\"I'd advise anyone coming to visit Rome to see the palaces of the powerful Roman families,\" says Angela.\nWhile listing a few examples – Palazzo Colonna and Palazzo Farnese among them – few rival the opulence of thePalazzo Doria Pamphilj, Rome's very own \"Versailles\", in Angela's words.\nThe product of an alliance of noble families, what resulted was a Baroque fantasy come to life and an impressive art collection featuring the works of many of Italy's greats, from Titian to Raphael.\nIts crown jewel is its Hall of Mirrors, commissioned by Gabriele Valvassori in the 1730s and featuring whimsical frescos, gilded Venetian frescos and ornate gold-plated furniture.\n\"I had never been prior to shooting [a TV special] and it's truly spectacular,\" he says. \"It truly surpasses anything else.\"\nWebsite:https://www.doriapamphilj.it/roma/\nAddress: Via del Corso 305, 00186\nPhone: +39 06 679 7323\nInstagram: @galleriadoriapamphilj\nMany visitors coming to Rome don't know that the city has what Angela considers its very own \"Pompeii\" around 32km from the city centre: Ostia Antica.\nOnce Rome's sea port, potentially from as early as the 7th Century BCE, Ostia Antica developed into a bustling seaside suburb, reaching a peak of 75,000 inhabitants in the late Imperial age. While the city declined after the empire’s fall, and the coastline ended up advancing by 3.2km, much of the ancient town that once stood there has been preserved.\n\"You lose yourself there, you can see everything,\" Angela says. \"Bakeries, public bathrooms (latrines), homes, apartment blocks… street businesses, not too dissimilar to those of today.\"\nA tour of Ostia Antica can show you much of the amenities and features of ancient Roman life – from its 1st-Century BCE theatre, to its forum, public baths and necropolis.\nFor Angela, Ostia Antica best preserves the \"popolare\" (working-class) soul of ancient Rome – one which its newer counterpart, the beach suburb Lido di Ostia, has carried on in modern form.\nOstia Antica is a roughly 30-minute drive from central Rome, and can be reached in around the same time by taking the Metromare commuter rail from the Porta S Paolo station.\nBBC Travel'sThe SpeciaListis a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "Soca musician Machel Montano shares his recs for enjoying his home nation during Carnival season and beyond.\nTrinidad and Tobago, a twin-island nation in the southern Caribbean renowned for its annualCarnival celebration(3-4 March 2025), has far more to offer visitors than just massive parades.\nThe birthplace ofsoca(a musical genre blending calypso, African, Caribbean and South Asian rhythms), Trinidad and Tobago stuns with its incredible beaches, lush rainforests and diverse wildlife. But despite the islands' dynamic music and festival culture, locals' favourite pastime isliming– simply hanging out.\nWe asked Trinidadian native and \"King of Soca\"Machel Montanofor the best ways to lime on his home islands. \"We are an island country of party and style,\" says the award-winning singer, songwriter, producer and actor. \"We celebrate through struggles and strife and especially celebrate our joys. Everything is a reason to come together.\"\nNo matter which island you’re on (it’s about a three-hour ferry ride between the two), you can expect to feel a lively spirit. \"Trinidad and Tobago are two pieces of one puzzle but they give you different experiences… so you get the best of both worlds,\" says Montano. \"Trinidad is where you come to experience the Carnival culture and steelpan orchestras, while Tobago, with its blue water, white-sand beaches and relaxed attitude, is somewhere you can chill and unwind.\"\nLocal island culture reflects the country's history of colonisation. \"Our style developed through the cultural influences of Spanish, English, French, Dutch, Caribbean, African and Indo-Trinidadian communities interacting with each other over time… we really blur the lines of culture,\" Montano says. \"We are a 'douglarised’ nation, meaning we’re a true mix of African and Indian cultures. We don’t just live side by side; we share our food, fashion, music and traditions.\"\nHere are Montano's favourite ways to experience Trinidad and Tobago.\nFor Montano, the best food in Trinidad and Tobago is found in the streets.\n\"Our most famous street food,doubles[curried chickpeas served on two fried flatbreads, topped with condiments like mango chutney and tamarind sauce], is available on nearly every corner. It’s a food that [harks back to] our cultural roots. It’s affordable, tasty and something we're known for internationally.\" His pro tip: find a vendor selling fresh coconut water, as locals do. \"Coconut water is the perfect pairing with any meal!\"\nWhen pressed to name a sit-down dining experience, Montano cites theBreakfast Shed: \"You know when you’re looking for good food, you’re always looking for your grandmother’s cooking? We call it the Breakfast Shed, but it’s not really a shed. It’s what you would call a modern-day food hall. They cook only local dishes with what we like to call a 'sweet hand'; this means they use the best seasonings. Everything is so tasty.\"\nMontano recommends ordering the callaloo, which is a popular Sunday dish in Trinidad and Tobago. \"[It's] a mixture of bushes [dasheen bush, also known as taro leaves] with okra and spinach and all these different things in there.\" He also recommends trying traditional stews,curries, pies or plant-based ingredients like pigeon peas: \"We call those plant-based dishes 'ground food'. Healthy food.\"\nMontano especially loves people watching at the Breakfast Shed: \"There are a lot of people from every walk of life, from salespeople to shopkeepers to students. Everyone is always rolling up to the Breakfast Shed.\"\nAddress: JFXP+M8M, Wrightson Rd, Port of Spain, Trinidad & Tobago\nMusic is a way of life in Trinidad and Tobago, whether you're catching a live soca performance or simply hanging out at a dive bar. Montano enjoys visitingKafe Blue, a calypso jazz cafe in Port of Spain, also known as Kaiso Blues Café. \"It’s owned by one of our favourite musicians, Carl Jacobs, who was one of the biggest producers and singers in Trinidad and Tobago when I was growing up,\" he says. \"You can see some of the greatest musicians in Trinidad… people like Leston Paul, a great jazz musician. You can also see calypso and reggae there, and pop music and even gospel music… It's a nice place to hang out with people and chat.\"\nAnother classic musical experience is visiting a panyard, a communal rehearsal space for steelpan bands. \"Even though pan music [music played on the steelpan] is associated with Carnival, travellers can also come to the islands anytime and visit a panyard,\" says Montano. \"Some of them are not active during the year, but a lot of them are, likeRenegadesandAll StarsandInvadersandPhase 2. You might pass and hear some calypso or some soca or even some classical music being played. You’ll hear all sorts of contemporary pop songs being played, too, because these bands tour the world.\" He adds: \"Nowhere else in the world would you be able to walk into an orchestral rehearsal and be a part of it and have a little lime.\"\nAddress: MF3J+JPQ, Wrightson Road, Port of Spain, Trinidad & Tobago\nPhone number: (868) 477-2262\n@kafeblue.tt\nTrinidad and Tobago is famous for its lush beaches, like Montano's pick;Maracas Beach, a tropical escape on Trinidad's north coast, about a 45-minute drive from Port of Spain through the leafy green Santa Cruz mountains; found in Maracas Bay.\n\"It's surrounded by beautiful mountains and the breeze is cool, so it brings serenity to a lot of people,\" Montano says. \"The people watching is always a delight as well… people are always having fun there.\"\nHe also notes that it's one of the most popular spots on the islands to get bake and shark, an iconic Trinidadian street food sandwich made from fried shark and fried bread and topped with condiments ranging from cucumbers to pineapple to \"special things\" likeshado beni(\"like a cilantro sauce\", Montano explains). There are multiple places to get it, Montano says, includingRichard's Bake & SharkandPatsy's Bake & Shark. Just be sure to top it with whatever speaks to you most. \"Everyone has their own way of doing it,\" says Montano. \"It’s all about your personal preference.\"\nWebsite:https://mtca.gov.tt/tourism_facilities/maracas-beach-facility/\nHitting the beach isn’t the only way to commune with nature in Trinidad and Tobago. Montano recommends spending time in theNorthern Range; a lush string of mountains running throughout northern Trinidad that covers about 25% of the entire island.\n\"There are amazing forest reserves, hiking trails and waterfalls there that offer a peaceful yet breathtaking experience,\" says Montano, who suggests paying close attention to the birds. There are more than 430 different species of birds in the Northern Range, not to mention more than 100 species of mammals including red howler monkeys, ocelots, and deer. “The Northern Range is really ideal for nature lovers,\" says Montano.\nAlso known as Independence Square, the street vendor- and busker-linedBrian Lara Promenaderuns through Port of Spain’s downtown area and is a fun spot to sit and people watch. \"It’s named after one of our most famous cricketers and is always buzzing with people,\" says Montano.\nOnce you’ve absorbed the rhythms of Trinidadian life, Montano suggests strolling toQueen’s Park Savannah, a 260-acre urban park. \"You’ll see lots of joggers, food vendors and the 'Magnificent Seven' [a group of seven colonial mansions],\" Montano says. \"[It's] a great mix of daily life and cultural heritage.\"\nCarnival is \"the heart and soul of our culture\", says Montano, so make it a point to visit while it's happening – traditionally the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday. \"Visitors can playmas(join in with a costume), meet incredible people, taste authentic local foods and immerse themselves in music and dance. It’s a full spectrum of art, expression and unity that showcases the creativity of our people.\"\nTo make the most of Carnival, Montano suggests heading to Trinidad and Tobago one week before the big celebrations and making sure to wear festive attire. \"The parties start the [week] before Carnival Monday, and continue every night right into J’ouvert,\" he explains. Known as the kick-off to Carnival, J’ouvert is a lively celebration that begins before sunrise on Carnival Monday morning in which partygoers dance through the streets covered in paint and mud and other substances. To do it right, wear clothes you don’t mind ruining, advises Montano. \"It’s the most fun to be dabbed in paint and powder and sometimes even chocolate,\" he says. \"Then you go home around 06:00 or 07:00, take a shower, take some rest and get back out on the road for what we call 'Monday Wear', which is when you usually wear a designer swimsuit and a little bit of your Tuesday costume.\"\nOn Tuesday, revellers dress up \"proper\" with feathers, beads and other \"fancy-looking, bright-looking, colourful-looking costumes,\" says Montano. Whatever you do, he advises, be wary of heels. \"You want to wear flats, because it’s all about jumping and waving and dancing. And having fun.\"\nWebsite:https://visittrinidad.tt/things-to-do/carnival/\nBBC Travel'sThe SpeciaListis a series of guides to popular and emerging destinations around the world, as seen through the eyes of local experts and tastemakers.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "summary": "This car-free isle off Donegal's coast was last inhabited full-time in the 1970s. Now, Owey locals are resurrecting a lost way of life – and adventurous travellers are welcome.",
    "content": "Located off Donegal's coast, this car-free isle was last inhabited full-time in the '70s. Now, locals are resurrecting a lost way of life – and adventurous travellers are welcome.\nFriday night on Owey Island and it's like we've been time-warped into the Ireland of years gone by. Smoke from burning turf fills the air as the small cluster of locals potter in and out of their well-maintained houses, sharing freshly caught fish and odd jobs. Friendly dogs roam free and chickens strut about. And as the roar of the sea and rustling of the reeds harmonise with warm, convivial chatter, it's hard to believe this lively haven lay dormant for decades.\nLocated off the coast of west Donegal in the Atlantic Ocean, the remote island of Owey (orUaighin Irish, meaning \"cave\") is approximately 15 minutes by boat fromCruit Island, which is joined to the mainland via a short car bridge. There is no ferry service to Owey, visitors can only access the island by kayak or private boat. There's also no electricity or running water, so only the distant lights twinkling from the mainland hint of civilisation – and modern-day pressures – further away.\nLast inhabited full-time in the 1970s, the island was home to around 100 residents and about 30 families at its pinnacle. But the lure of modern conveniences on the mainland led to a dwindling population, with the last remaining islanders leaving in 1977 and the place lying abandoned for more than 25 years.\nI was spending a long weekend on Owey with theWild Women of the Woods (Northern Ireland), an organisation of more than 4,000 members that aims to connect women from all over Ireland to experience nature and adventure together in wild, untamed settings. Outdoor enthusiast Rachel Pedder, who set up the organisation, wanted to bring the group \"somewhere that was off the beaten track and not generally accessible\".\nShe explained: \"It is hard to get to. At any of the other islands you can rock up at on a ferry and have a dander about and stay, whereas Owey it very much belongs to the community. You have to be very respectful of the fact that it's really their island and as long as you respect that, then they are welcoming.\" she added.\nPaul Cowan, one of the first wave pioneering Owey's renaissance, spent his teenage years on Owey, having moved here with his family in the early 1970s to escape the unrest on the streets of Belfast at the height ofthe Troubles. \"My mother's from Rutland Island, which is the next island to it,\" explained Cowan. \"The Troubles had got really bad and my father thought the best way out was to buy a house on an island. That was it. We all moved [to Owey].\"\nHaving since returned to Belfast to marry and settle with their own families, Cowan and his brother decided to take their kids on a boat trip to Owey in the early 2000s for a change of scene.\nDespite finding the island deserted, with many of the old cottages and outhouses turned to ruin after more than 25 years of neglect against the Atlantic breeze, the brothers saw the potential in the place as a peaceful escape from their busy, city lives. Along with some of their other siblings (there are 12 of them altogether) they set about fixing up the old family home and started building new houses.\nSeeing fresh life breathed into the place, other descendants of the island, who like Cowan had spent time there throughout their youth, were inspired to return and fix up the old properties in an attempt to return Owey to its former glory. Resurrecting the dilapidated houses was no easy task, however, with all supplies having to be brought over by boat. But around 20 homes are now standing, with a seasonal community of 20-30 people living here during the warmer months. There is also one hostel that sleeps up to six people (and a spot for wild camping), but no shops or other facilities.\nOwey's isolation is what attracts both locals and travellers. The seasonal community are passionate about keeping the island untouched by present-day conventions. Visitors are generally wanting to disconnect from the fast pace of life elsewhere or seeking adventure, with the rugged landscape attracting kayakers for the sea caves and rock climbers for the sea cliffs, as well as hill walkers.\nSix of our 14-strong group were staying inOwey Island Cottage Hostel, which islander Niall McGinley opens up to visitors in summer, and others were camping in the next-door-neighbour's garden.\nThe hostel was once McGinley's grandmother's home and the last house on the island to be lived in, so it has weathered the decades of neglect better than most. Still retaining much of its original furniture, the cottage has two bedrooms off the main living space, where there's a gas stove, table and chairs and an open fire for everyone to gather around in the evenings. Befitting how the islanders have always lived, amenities are limited to a compost toilet in an outhouse, just a stroll away at the back of the cottage.\nOne local, Frankie Gallagher, calls the island home because it's the birthplace of his father, and after growing up in Scotland, he now divides his time between Owey (weather permitting) and the Donegal mainland. \"Certainly we would never be looking to get electricity into the island because we can actually do well around it,\" he said.\nAlongside using gas and solar for heat, light and power, the islanders use tanks on the roof to collect rainwater. This allows Gallagher to have a gas shower in his home with the water pump running off solar. \"But it is slightly limited because there's only so much water that you can store so you have to be conscious about how long you're in the shower,\" he added.\nGallagher says this simpler lifestyle means sunsets are spectacular, with no light pollution and highly visible star constellations. He said apart from the occasional roar of a quad bike, the greatest noise pollution is from a corn crake, a rare – and noisy – bird that was once native to the island and often returns in summer.\nThe hostel is about 10 minutes on foot from where the boat docks, and after picking my bed for the night (with the help of a couple of curious free-range chickens) I sauntered down to the nearby ravine for a dip, catching the last of the sun as it glistened across the water.\nThe car-free island measures just more than 300 acres in total. The southern end is grassy and fertile with a small harbour for boats to berth. Steep steps from the pier bring you to a dirt path leading to the \"village centre\" where all the homes are built on either side of a long, narrow, gurgling stream, backed by undulating hills as far as the eye can see.\nFragments of the olden days remain in the form of crumbled stone ruins, including the old schoolhouse (there was once a school, a shop and a post office on the island) alongside signs of new life, like wheelbarrows and fishing tackle interspersed among vegetable plots and flowerbeds.\nBy contrast, the northern end of the island is exposed, rocky and barren – too rough to live on – with jagged cliffs jutting out from the sea caves that give the island its name, accompanied by vertiginous sea stacks rising majestically from crashing waves buffeted by the northern winds.\nA highlight of my trip was an adrenalin-fuelled kayaking tour of the sea caves withSelkie Sailing, a family-run business where husband and wife team, Gareth and Amanda Doherty, guide large groups across the water from Cruit Island on sit-on-top kayaks. We spent an exhilarating three hours on Saturday afternoon negotiating the waves around the rocks on the environs of the island, squeezing through soaring granite structures and meandering in and out of crevices so cinematic it was like we were extras in a movie.\nTo enjoy this unspoilt beauty in a more laid-back way, on Sunday afternoon, our group went in search of a clifftop lake, hidden amongst the rocks at the back of the island with a panoramic view of the sea. It's where one of the islanders told us they often go for a wash and a dip. To reach it, we climbed wild path north of the hostel, ascended a grassy hill that led to a plateaued cliffside and then carefully made our way down glistening pink and grey granite to discover the lagoon in all its glory.\nPlunging into shiny, black freshwater flanked by moss-covered rocks, we swam, washed and laughed – engulfed by the surreal beauty of being in a clifftop lake overlooking the ocean. I surprised myself by how relaxed I felt around people I'd only just met and a sense of peace enveloped me. We were blissfully marooned together on island time. Our roles as mums, grannies, professionals and partners were whisked away with the Atlantic wind. There was nowhere to be and nothing to rush for.\nMore like this:\n•The incredible reinvention of Ireland's 'awful' tourist town\n•The UK's network of free hiking 'hotels'\n•Ireland's heartbreaking walk of forced emigration\nOur last night on Owey was similar to the other evenings on the island: we prepared vegetables outside the cottage while the sun went down, cooked on the gas stove in candlelight and feasted on bean stew and wine around the campfire where the small group of locals – who we'd got to know over the course of the weekend – joined us for more revelry and a rapturous sing-song.\nSitting outside, watching the flames of the fire dance in the wind and listening to a group rendition ofthe Rare Auld Times, one of my campmates turned to me and said, \"We're winning aren't we?\". Even though I'd only met her a couple of days before, I knew exactly what she meant: the fresh air, the island's stories relayed through song, the stars so visible in the night sky… the peacefulness of Owey.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "With season three of The White Lotus drawing fresh waves of visitors to the already bustling shores of Phuket and Koh Samui, a very different story is unfolding across the Gulf of Thailand.\nAs season three ofThe White Lotusprepares to thrust Thailand's islands into the global spotlight, drawing fresh waves of visitors to the already bustling shores of Phuket and Koh Samui, a very different story is unfolding across the Gulf of Thailand. Here, a speck of an island named Koh Mak has quietly positioned itself as a model for sustainable tourism, offering a rare vision of what the future of travel in Thailand could be.\nHeading towards Koh Mak's southern shores by speedboat, my first impression was disarmingly simple: golden sand curving into clear shallows while coconut palms leaned towards the sea as though caught mid-bow. There were no high-rises, no blaring beach clubs. Instead, low-slung bungalows peeked through the trees and bicycles outnumbered cars on the island's quiet roads.\nI checked into theMakathanee Resortnext to the jetty and studied a map to get my bearings. Just 16 sq km in size, Koh Mak is flat apart from a few gentle hills, perfect for exploring by bike. Eager to tap into the island's slow rhythm, I pedalled north-east through plantations of rubber trees and coconut palms to Laem Son beach. Here, I found little more than a shack made of coconut trunks and fronds and a few deck chairs facing a blissfully empty stretch of sand. I ordered a coconut shake and enjoyed a delicious half hour soaking up the silence before heading across to the settlement of Ao Suan Yai. Even here, there was little to detract from the island's natural beauty, just several tastefully designed, low-key resorts tucked away behind a white-sand beach and a line of palms all leaning at the same angle towards the sea.\nAs I completed my brief tour, I was amazed to realise that during my bike ride I had seen no international hotels or shopping malls, no McDonalds or KFCs and not a single 7-Eleven, which seem to be on every street corner throughout the rest of Thailand.\nPromoted by the Tourist Authority of Thailand (TAT) asthe country's first low-carbon destination, Koh Mak has become a testing ground for how small islands can thrive without sacrificing their soul to mass tourism. Unlike its larger, better-known neighbours ­– party-friendly Koh Chang to the north and exclusive Koh Kood to the south – Koh Mak is charting a slower, quieter course. Its approach, driven by the island's long-time landowning families, has earnedinternationalrecognitionfor sustainable tourism. But it is the lived reality that truly sets it apart. This is not an island clinging to an imagined past; it's one that is actively shaping a different kind of future.\nWhile many Thai islands fall under the jurisdiction of the Thai government, Koh Mak remains in the hands of five families, descendants of a civil servant named Luang Prompakdee who purchased the island's coconut plantations in the early 20th Century. Yodchai Sudhidhanakul, president of the Koh Mak Tourism Club and one of Prompakdee's descendants, told me that this tight-knit ownership structure has been key to protecting the island's tranquil character and encouraging slow tourism.\n\"It's not that we don't want tourists; in fact, many residents depend on tourism,\" Sudhidhanakul said. \"But we hope to attract a particular type of visitor – those who are respectful of others and appreciate the benefits of a quiet life.\"\nIn 2018, residents formalised their vision in the Koh Mak Charter. The agreement bans vehicle ferries from docking at the island, restricts motorbike rentals to 70% of room capacity, prohibits loud music after 22:00 and noisy water sports like jet skis, and bans the use of foam or plastic containers.\n\"We never worried about overtourism,\" said Sudhidhankul, \"as our available accommodation has remained at a steady 750 rooms, but we wanted to be part of the low-carbon initiative. Thus, most resort owners use renewable energy where possible and make efforts to recycle and dispose of waste responsibly.\"\nThis ethos extends beyond policy. Local initiatives like theKoh Mak Coral Conservation Groupoffer snorkelling trips where visitors can learn how to propagate corals using recycled PVC pipes. Waste disposal is a collective effort, with regular beach cleanups coordinated byTrash Hero, a voluntary group with the motto, \"Every week we clean, we educate, we change\". And at the island's coconut plantation, visitors can learn how to harvest coconuts and make cold-pressed coconut oil, while tie-dye workshops teach traditional fabric-dyeing techniques using natural pigments.\nMore like this:\n•Measuring the 'White Lotus effect': How TV and film locations impact travel\n•Here's where Asia's best female chef goes for pad Thai in Bangkok\n•Thailand's cooling rice dish to beat the heat\nI spent the next few days earnestly practising slow-life activities: reading in a hammock, snoozing in a deck chair, swimming and taking long walks along the beach looking for shells. Unfortunately, most of what I found would only be of interest to the Trash Heroes – plastic bottles, old shoes and torn fishing nets. There were plenty of other activities to choose from, including diving and snorkelling trips, kayaking, paddle boarding, classes in massage and cooking, Thai boxing and yoga.\nI took part in a game of disc golf (aka frisbee golf) and joined atie-dyeing workshop, where I made a shirt that gave me a great sense of accomplishment. Workshop leader Rodjamarn Sirirut showed us a display of more than 20 natural dyes made from local plants such as indigo, malabar, mango, mangosteen and coconut shell; impressive evidence of the island's natural diversity. These pursuits made a change from lounging at swim-up pool bars or stuffing myself at buffets as I might have done if I had been staying at an international resort.\nOne day I joined a snorkelling trip to Koh Rang, an island to the west of Koh Mak that is part of theKoh Chang Marine National Park. On the boat I chatted with Rong Rong Zhu, a former research scientist in the US who now spends most of her time on Koh Mak. \"When I travelled in Asia in 2018, I found Koh Mak to be a very walkable and bike-friendly island,\" she said. \"I was able to rent a house with a beautiful view and now I have many digital nomad friends who spend half the year here.\"\nKoh Mak is not immune to the challenges facing small islands. Plastic debris still washes up on its shores, swept in by ocean currents. And while the island's co-working hub,Koh Mak Campus, set up by Sudhidhanakul in 2020, encourages longer stays and digital nomads, balancing tourism and development remains a delicate task. \"We want to attract seasonal inhabitants, and we need to develop more expertise in the use of renewable energy.\" Sudhidhanakul told me.\nYet, as I slipped into the island's rhythm – cycling from one beach to another, sipping coconut shakes under palm trees and chatting with residents who spoke of their home with both pride and protectiveness – it became clear that Koh Mak offers something increasingly rare in Thailand.\nIt is a reminder that a different kind of tourism is possible, one that doesn't require sacrificing a place's spirit for progress. As the speedboat carried me back towards the busy mainland, I found myself hoping that Koh Mak's quiet revolution might inspire others to follow its lead.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "You can’t book them and you don't know who else will be there, but they're an excellent way to explore Britain's most remote corners – for free.\nHiking up to the top of a valley in Wales'Cambrian Mountains, I was struck by the silence. The noise of the modern world that we've trained ourselves to filter out becomes conspicuous by its absence. This is probably the best indication that you've entered one of Britain's remote places, and a good sign if you're trying to find a bothy, one of the free-to-use shelters that dot the country's wild areas.\nFounded in 1965, theMountain Bothy Association (MBA)is a registered charity that maintains \"simple shelters in remote country for the use of all who love wild and lonely places\". The organisation manages more than 100 bothies in Scotland, Wales and Northern England.\nThe system is simple. Bothies are free to use and open to anyone. They can't be booked in advance, and there's an unwritten rule that the bothy is never full (although groups of six or more and commercial groups are asked not to use them). As long as you follow the MBA'sBothy Code, which is based on respect for other users, the bothy and the surroundings, you're welcome.\nThat is if you can find them. Although the grid references are availableonline, don't count on phone signal when looking for them, and even with a well-marked map, they can prove elusive.\nI was hiking a network of trails in an area known as the \"Green Desert of Wales\" because of its lack of settlements, roads and infrastructure. I planned to sleep atNant Syddion bothybefore heading to Aberystwyth, the largest nearby town, the next day. Given the relative scarcity of buildings in the landscape, I'd expected to locate the bothy easily. But climbing up and down a succession of forestry tracks as the sun began to set, I began to wonder if I was going to find it at all.\nWith relief, I finally caught the reflection of a window through the trees and climbed down a steep path to a two-storey stone building that looked like a home transported into the middle of nowhere, complete with a spiral of smoke climbing out of the chimney. And that's exactly what it was. Nant Syddion used to be home to a lead miner and his family and now provides a temporary home for hikers.\nEvery bothy is an adapted building with a previous life. Most are old shepherd's huts, farmsteads or workers' accommodation. In the early 20th Century, hill farming declined and fewer and fewer people lived in remote locations, leaving many buildings derelict. After World War Two, hiking and mountaineering as leisure pursuits dramatically increased in popularity and those exploring the outdoors began using these abandoned buildings as shelters. The MBA was created by Bernard Heath and a group of friends to restore and maintain them for like-minded individuals.\nRemote upland country takes its toll on buildings; the wind and rain age, erode and wear almost everything. However, arriving at the bothy, I found that everything was watertight and functional. Even the gate and the front door had recently been painted.\nKeeping 100 buildings habitable in some of the remotest parts of Britain is no mean feat. When you factor in that this work is all done by volunteers (and where bothies have toilets, it involves carrying the waste out), it's a step beyond altruism. Each bothy has two maintenance organisers, and work parties are organised for any large-scale or structural jobs, which, Neil Stewart, head of communications at the MBA, told me, are rarely lacking in willing hands.\nAlthough they're maintained, bothies are by no means luxurious. You won't find electricity or running water and will be lucky to have a long-drop toilet. Most will have a stove, but there's no guarantee a supply of fuel will be there. Your comforts are carried in, and you should pack as if you're camping, including a tent if the bothy is overcrowded or you don't fancy the company.\nThe company you find in bothies, and the fact that it's completely unpredictable, is one of their unique attractions, according to Phoebe Smith, authorThe Book of the Bothy. \"In a world where everything is bookable and controllable, I love that you can't do that with a bothy,\" she said. \"You just have to go and turn up, and you could have it all to yourself or you could meet some incredible people and share some incredible memories. [Bothies] connect you with other people.\"\nWhen I arrived at Nant Syddion, there were already two cyclists in the main room who were doing an off-road tour of the area. I laid out my roll mat and sleeping bag in the last unoccupied upstairs room and went to join them.\nAfter introducing myself to the cyclists, Alex and Simon, I prepared a quick meal over my gas stove while they battled to get the fire to take. Built to withstand its exposed position, the bothy had thick walls and small windows, so when the light began to disappear, it got dark quickly. We lit a succession of candles and arranged our chairs in a semicircle around the roaring fire.\nOne of the best parts of bothying for me is that people are drawn to socialise together – although you're under no obligation if you want your own space. As we warmed up by the fire, one, then two bottles of whisky (something of a traditional drink for bothies) did the round and stories began to flow. We talked about recent hiking trips in the Dolomites and our bothy experiences, arriving at one to find it full of ex-soldiers in the middle of a reunion drinking session. Hours passed and laughter continued until we remembered we had to hike and cycle back out the next day, and reluctantly left the warmth of the main room to sleep.\nA feature of every bothy is the bothy book, where people record their experiences and motivations for visiting. The next morning, I read through accounts ranging from people sheltering from the rain to alleged supernatural happenings. There was an entry roughly every couple of days, indicating a steady flow of people passing through.\nHowever, it's only been in the last decade and a half that bothies have shifted away from being something of a closed society. In 2009, the locations of the MBA bothies were shared online by the organisation. \"It used to be quite a secretive organisation in the sense that people found out where the bothies were by joining the association or just coming across them in the wilderness areas,\" Stewart explained. \"But that was unsustainable with the internet and people using the outdoors. And it was against our charitable aim. If we're providing buildings for people to use, it's logical we have to tell them where they are, we can't leave them secret.\"\nThis move wasn't unanimously popular. Part of the concern was that the people might begin using these spaces as places to party as opposed to a shelter while enjoying outdoor pursuits. But, as Stewart told me, it's not a problem that's unique to bothies. \"We have had examples of drinking parties in bothies, but we're not particularly bothered with that… There are problems with wild camping in many areas of the country. Up in Scotland, there's a ban on wild camping in one of the national parks because people were littering, leaving rubbish [and] cutting down trees for fires.\"\nMore like this:\n•Japan's car-free town that autumn hikers love\n•The US homes made from waste materials\n•Norway's simple answer to greener, cleaner living\nThe MBA has no way of accurately recording visitor numbers, but anecdotal evidence from their maintenance teams suggests their use has increased with the greater availability of information around them. Smith said, \"There's a whole debate to be had, but the fact of the matter was that bothy users and volunteers, who were fixing them and repairing them, were ageing out and we need younger people coming in.\"\nWhile the locations of the MBA bothies are no longer a mystery, these aren't the only bothies that exist in the UK. There are others, maintained by estates or climbing clubs, where the old system of secrecy endures. As well as the adventure of seeking out hidden bothies whose locations still can't be found online, every bothy experience is unique. With a constantly changing cast of people seeking shelter, the sheer unpredictability is a rare chance in the modern world to embrace serendipity, and that's what inspires me to continue seeking them out.\nHiking out the next morning, I stopped at the bend in the track behind which the bothy would be lost in the trees. It would remain open the next night and the next, for anyone needing shelter, and I thought about all the stories and experiences I'd read through in the bothy book. The MBA network continues to grow and develop. Compostable toilets are being added to more sites, and Stewart shared that two new bothies are currently in the pipeline. That means plenty more stories to come.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "Nearly a decade before Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg was even born, Växjö set itself on a path to a new vision of green urban living.\nThe 1,000-year-old Swedish city of Växjö sits 450km south-west of Stockholm in the central region of Småland amid a lush tapestry of sylvan landscapes dotted by hundreds of lakes. This is a land known as theGlasriket(\"Glass Kingdom\") that's home to a string of globally renowned glassworks such asKosta BodaandOrreforswho have created crystalline gorgeousness from fiery furnaces since the 1740s.\nBut that glassmaking heritage is now matched by changemaking: this compact city of fewer than 100,000 inhabitants has become a global beacon in the battle against climate change. Nearly a decade before Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg was even born, Växjö set itself on a path to a new vision of urban living that's now been emulated worldwide.\n\"It was a seminar in 1996 led by the mayor, which asked the question: 'What would it be like to live in a fossil free city?',\" explains Henrik Johansson, environmental strategist for Växjö Municipality. By the end of that meeting, a unanimous vote saw Växjö become the first city in the world to commit to become fossil fuel free. This has now evolved into a bigger target ofclimate neutrality by 2030– 15 years ahead of Sweden'snationwide commitment.\nVäxjö's groundbreaking 1990s commitment drew media coverage from as far afield as Japan, with TV crews ironically taking fuel-guzzling long-distance flights to visit the place Johansson wryly describes as \"this crazy town looking to go fossil free\". None of it seems crazy now, however, with Växjö's per capita carbon emissions slashed bymore than70%from 1990s levels, all while the city has grown in population by a third and doubled its per capita GDP.\nHere, local buses and council vehicles run on biofuel made from domestic household organic waste. More than 90% of the city's energy, meanwhile, is sourced from forestry by-products and other biomass, with plentiful material coming from the vast surrounding forests. This ranges from sawdust from local timber mills to branches left from tree-felling to make goods for IKEA – the global design giant born just a half hour train ride away in the town of Älmhult.\nThe few CO2 emissions that linger in the air stem from personal car users who are still not taking advantage of one of Sweden's best provisions of electric car charging stations, plus places to fill up on non-fossil biofuels such as ethanol.\nThe boldest transition, though, has seen Växjö become perhaps the world's leading showcase for large-scale timber architecture, with half of all new builds required to be in wood, sourced from the same sprawling forests that once provided fuel to fire the glasswork furnaces.\nI arrive in Växjö by train and can't help but start snapping pictures of a station interior unlike any I've ever seen. Stepping off the platform, I enter a seven-storey edifice that hosts both theCentral Station and Växjö City Hall, and everywhere I look, there's wood. Here, timber is used for both structure and decor in a calm, soaring space that also includes a tourist office, exhibition area and eye-catching artworks made from pale wood. It's such a welcoming space that it's been nicknamed the city's public \"living room\".\nA wooden bridge connects the station with a museum quarter that I explore the next day, featuring theSwedish Glass Museumwithin theSmålandMuseum; plus theHouse of Emigrants, which tells the often revelatory story of Swedish mass emigration to North America.\nThe museum enclave is also home to myriad relocated buildings from past centuries – I particularly like the windmill as a symbol of ancient green power, built from timbers painted the iconic Swedish shade known as Falu or Falun Red, named after its historic source from mines around the eponymous town.\nHeading down to the shore of Lake Trummen – one of two nearby lakes, along withsculpture-lined Växjösjön– I potter alonga trail of modern sculpturesthat provides a cultural promenade of contemporary works chosen and voted for by residents. Glass art is celebrated too, with contrasting crystalline creations placed along the cosmopolitan length of Sandgärdsgatan that runs through the heart of the city centre to the iconic double-spired cathedral.\nIt's a beautiful stroll, and I wonder whether people would have been so keen to leave Sweden if 19th-Century life had offered what the 21st-Century nation does. Alongside enviable public services and a famously equable society, I'm getting housing envy staring up at contrasting high-rise wooden apartment blocks that make up the award-winningKvarteret Geologenresidential complex (also known as Trummens Strand), standing tall and proud by the lake.\nHere, I'm joined by Olivia Thim, a sustainability expert for property management firm Vöfab. \"For a long time, we had thetallest wooden buildingin Sweden,\" Thim says. \"But also a diversity: apartments, sports arenas, schools. We just thought that we should try to build everything in wood first.\"\nAlso with us is architect Karin Hård Af Segerstad from leading Växjö practiceArkitektbolaget, who tells me about the super-strong cross-laminated timber (CLT) used for structural frames, augmented by cedar shaving facades and various interior woods. This swaddling in natural materials is as pleasing to the residents as it is to the eye, she says: “People report an improved sense of well-being living surrounded by wood.\"\nMore like this:\n•10 sustainable travel destinations to visit in 2024\n•Nordhavn: The Danish 'city' that's been designed for an easy life\n•How the youngest Canary Island escaped mass tourism\nFor architects and engineers, Växjö's showcasing of innovative timber builds has been a valuable learning curve. \"People weren't so knowledgeable about wooden high-rise buildings, so we have close collaboration with the local university,\" says Segerstad. \"Every time there was a question, there would be research done.\"\nThis includes sensors within buildings to record how the structures perform over years and changing seasons. \"Now we have researchers coming from around the world,\" she continues. \"Many from Austria and Germany, but also places in Africa such as Congo.  We have become world pioneers to build in wood. Aesthetic principles are as important as ecological ones.\"\nThe environmental drive underpinning Växjö's modern wood architecture is matched by how the city powers its 21st century life. Exploring the city centre, I can see innovative new wooden structures next to historic clapboard buildings, many transformed into trendy shops or atmospheric restaurants, such asKafe de Luxewhere the traditional Swedish dishes rely on produce from the surrounding land and water.\nMeanwhile, at modern design hotelPM & Vanner, the restaurants focus on local, seasonal and organic dishes, including produce from the hotel's own garden – while dishes are cleaned using an energy- and water-saving dishwasher. Food waste is turned into biofuel, and the hotel is also part of an innovative textile recycling system.\nBefore I leave, I walk around the wood-decorated offices of local power generator VEAB with CEO Erik Tellgren, who tells me how forest and wood product \"waste\" taken from around Växjö easily provides all the electricity requirements of the city, in a manner that also helps the battle to mitigate climate change.\n\"Forest residues left to decompose generate CO2,\" says Tellgren. \"So, using it up helps cut emissions.\" And, he adds, the ash produced from the burned wood is returned to the forest floor as anexcellent compost.\nHe smiles as he recalls how Växjö's first power plant, which fired up here beside the lake in the 1880s, burned wood, and now some 140 years later, the town is again relying on the material as it leads the world away from fossil fuels\n\"So we began with wood, and now we come back to it again,\" he says.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "The baba is often served at Easter in Poland, with the most extraordinary version – the muslin baba – made from a rich dough of flour, yeast, butter and quite a lot of egg yolks.\nDepending on where it's baked, thebabaorbabkatakes on many different forms. In the US, it's a braided brioche-like bread that often has chocolate, nuts or other ingredients mixed in. Europeans might be more familiar withbaba au rhum, a desert popular in France and Italy that is soaked in liqueur and served in individual portions.\nBut in Poland, the word \"baba\" can refer to a variety of baked goods. Some are made in Bundt pans, while others are loaf shaped. Some are more bread-like and use yeast while others more closely resemble pound cake, like the lemon baba I made for my son's birthday. And some, like the potato babka so popular in Poland's Podlasie region, are savoury instead of sweet.\n[jump to recipe]\nThe typical yeasted baba is often served at Easter and added to the Easter basket brought to church to be blessed, with the most extraordinary version being themuslin babanamed for muslin cloth because of its lightness. It's made from a rich dough that contains flour, butter, yeast and a lot of egg yolks – 96 of them for every kilogram of flour.\nOne food websitesays to \"take a deep breath\", as the home version of the muslin baba recipe calls for just 250g of flour, so you willonlyneed 24 egg yolks. By contrast, the Easter baba recipe I usually make contains six egg yolks for 500g of flour (or 12 egg yolks per kilogram), and I already consider that to be a lot.\nThe original recipe for muslin baba is often credited to the 19th-Century food writer and journalist Lucyna Ćwierczakiewiczowa, an extremely popular and successful cookbook writer at the time. I came across the recipe in two other cookbooks: Jak Gotować (How to Cook) by Maria Disslowa, first published in 1931, and then again inOld Polish Traditions in the Kitchen and at the Table(published in 1979) by Maria Lemnis and Henryk Vitry, both pseudonyms of Polish musicologist Tadeusz Żakiej, which provides fascinating insights into the life and traditions of pre-war Poland.\n\"The cook, the lady of the house and all the women locked themselves up in the kitchen,\" Żakiej writes. \"They sieved the whitest of flours, mixed hundreds of egg yolks with sugar in clay bowls, dissolved saffron in vodka.\"\nThis is not the easiest of recipes. It requires long mixing and rising times and keeping an eye on the oven during baking to prevent burning (not to mention having to crack so many eggs). In other words, making baba was serious business.\nSome say that the name \"baba\" (the word for \"woman\" in Polish) referred to the fact that the dough was finnicky and moody, \"just like a woman's temperament\". And men weren't allowed into the kitchen during baking as it was thought their presence could lead to a failed, undercooked cake. While the dough was rising, it would be covered in a linen tablecloth and doors and windows were sealed to prevent drafts. After baking, the baba rested on cushions, and because it was thought to be so sensitive until it fully cooled, everyone would whisper because it was believed loud noises would cause it to collapse. Sometimes, after taking the baba out of the oven, the kitchen would be filled with sobbing: \"A burned or collapsed baba was a terrible faux pas,\" Żakiej writes.\nBut one question remains, why the extreme amount of egg yolks?\n\"Egg yolks contain lecithin, which acts as natural leavening agent,\" says Jacek Malarski, the co-founder ofLukullus, a Warsaw-based bakery that sells the 96-egg yolk baba (or as they call it, Baba 96). \"Adding a large amount of yolks results in a tender and fluffy texture, and adding an extreme amount of egg yolks results in an extremely fluffy texture, like a cloud.\"\nBecause of their high fat content and emulsifying properties, the egg yolks also make the baba last for longer without having to add any preservatives and give the finished product a beautiful golden-yellow colour.\nIn the past, serving such a rich pastry was a status symbol. \"Fat was more expensive than even the most expensive of meats,\" says Jarosław Dumanowski, a food historian at the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń. The recipe also calls for 400g of butter for every kilogram of flour, which acts as carrier for the vanilla flavour. Some households even added saffron, one of the most expensive spices. \"These were exotic things from far away so that rich people could distinguish themselves from the rest,\" Dumanowski says.\nMore like this:\n•Poland's famous gingerbread from Torun\n•The dumpling that comforts Poland\n•Bebinca: a multi-layered egg yolk cake\nWhen Malarski and his partner, Albert Judycki, decided to offer a baba at Lukullus bakery, they tested several dozens of versions, both old and modern, before deciding on a clear winner: the muslin baba. \"The muslin baba was beyond compare. It melted in your mouth and remained fresh for longest,\" Malarski says. They use bourbon vanilla from Madagascar and cover the Baba 96 in homemade lemon glaze. The muslin baba has been making a regular appearance at Lukullus at Easter ever since.\nWhen I ask Malarski about the popularity of this particular baba despite it being so rich and labour-intensive, he replied: \"It's the best. If someone tries it, they never want to go back. They miss it too much.\"\nMuslin baba recipe\nAdapted from Old Polish Traditions in the Kitchen and at the Table\nIn a heated bain-marie, beat the egg yolks and sugar (what remains after separating out 1 tsp) until white and fluffy. The original recipe calls for half an hour by hand with a whisk but with an electric mixer, 10 minutes should be enough. Set aside to cool.\nHeat up the milk until lukewarm and add the yeast, 1 tsp sugar and 1 tsp flour. Let rest until bubbly, around 5 minutes.\nAdd this mixture, with the remaining flour and vanilla bean seeds or vanilla extract to the egg yolks and sugar and beat for another 10 minutes.\nAdd the melted (but not hot) butter, beat for another 10 minutes, then leave the dough to rest in a warm place until doubled in size. The dough will be loose, more like a cake batter than yeast dough. (You won't be able to knead it, not by hand and not with the dough hook. Even the stretch-and-fold technique, typically used when handling wetter doughs, will fail here.)\nWhen it has doubled in size, carefully transfer it to a buttered 4-liter-sized Bundt pan.\nAllow it to rest in a warm spot until the dough has risen out of the form. In the meantime, preheat the oven to 170C/340F.\nCarefully transfer the baba to the hot oven and bake for 35-40 minutes but keep a good eye on it as the high amount of egg yolk and sugar may cause it to burn easily. A toothpick inserted into the baba should come out clean. Allow to cool.\nRemove from the pan, then decorate with lemon glaze (a mix of lemon juice and powdered sugar to taste), or candied orange peel if you wish.\n* If 24 yolks seems excessive to you, you can halve the recipe and make a smaller baba.\n** Some people online have suggested decreasing the amount of yeast to 45g.\nThis story was originally published in 2024.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "In a quiet corner of North Carolina, bees produce a violet-hued honey so rare and unpredictable that even experts can't explain it – and that's what makes it magical.\nIn theSandhills regionof North Carolina, between the capital of Raleigh and the Nascar Hall of Fame in the sport-mad town of Charlotte, visitors may not even realise what a rare ecological niche they're stepping into. This is where the Atlantic once met the venerable Uwharrie Mountains, 145km inland; when the ocean pulled away, it left behind the grit that gave the region its name.\nThe region is one of the last homes for unique flora and fauna like the southern hognose snake and the Carolina gopher frog, both of which are endangered. What it's also known for, though, is something that has university researchers, foodies and conspiracy theorists all scratching their heads. It's a rare and coveted honey in a deep shade of aubergine-purple, and no one knows for sure what gives it the hue.\nPeople largely travel to the Sandhills region for open-air adrenaline pursuits and laid-back rural charm – think corn mazes, trout fishing and country fair-style Americana.\nThe prestigious Pinehurst Golf Resort, commonly referred to as the \"cradle of American golf\", is here (don't miss its celebrated No 2 course), as is thehorse riding hub Southern Pinesand its abundance of equestrian trails and backcountry trekking. Kayakers and canoers flock to Drowning Creek, drawn by the scenic 13-mile route from Turnpike Road to Highway 401.\nHunting classic Southern game like white-tailed deer, wild turkey and wood ducks is popular in these parts, with extensive land preserves designated for conservation to support the pursuit. The longleaf pine forests are themselves a thing of simple beauty, and twitchers come here to search for northern bobwhite quails, bald eagles and – the star attraction – imperilled red-cockaded woodpeckers with their binoculars.\nBut travellers also come to the region to seek out something even more extraordinary than threatened species and unique biomes. Here, if the conditions are exactly right (a mystery even to the experts) and the timing is perfect (a secret only the bees know), apiarists will visit their hives and find not just frames brimming with a slow and sultry river of liquid gold, but perhaps one that gleams with deep violet treasure.\n\"It is true that nobody knows what causes purple honey,\" says Paige Burns, who has a degree in horticulture and works with farmers and foresters in her role as the Richmond County Extension Director. Theories abound, both of the folklore and pseudo-scientific variety, and much like a porch swing, everybody here has one.\nBurns tells me a few of the more popular speculations: that it's the alkalinity of the soil changing the honey's colour as it does hydrangeas from blue to pink; that it's wild berries surrounding the bee's territory; and, the one that sparks the most vociferous debate among locals, that it's the deep violet flower of the invasive (and wildly reviled)kudzu vine. Beekeepers in the area have reported finding the jewel-hued honey in their hives for years, but even so, its appearance is so sporadic and at the whim of chance, it continues to be a surprise when it does appear.\nDon Dees, who owns and operatesDees Bees Apiaryin nearby Aberdeen, North Carolina, has purple honey on his website, but it's sold out. It's impossible to pre-sale for this year's harvest since no one knows how much, or even if, the bees will deign to colour the combs in plum or in the customary amber. Instead, he invites people to check hisFacebook pagefor updates from mid-July. His pure raw honey costs $16.50 (£13) for 900g. Purple honey, when he has it, goes for $75 (about £58) for an 85g glass jar. Talk about finding treasure; this is a limited edition in every sense of the word.\nDees'take on the phenomenon? He refutes the lore that aluminium in the terrain plays a factor and insists that kudzu isn't part of the equation, reasoning his apiary would produce it every season if so. Purple honey is most likely to arise under drought-like conditions, he says, and Dees believes that blue-black huckleberries that grow on shrubs rooted in thirst-tolerant clay feed the hard-up-for-food bees that can't locate traditional more water-dependent blooms.\nHowever, Rusty Burlew, a master beekeeper who directs the Native Bee Conservancy of Washington State, says that a lot of circumstantial evidence points to the inky-violet flower of the kudzu, and she doubts that bees have the jaws necessary to pierce fruit for nectar. Flavour-wise, she says, \"to my untrained palate, the honey really does taste purple, in a grape-y sort of way\".\nBurns tells me that she's never been one of the lucky ones to harvest the jammy-sweet treasure. \"One of the beekeepers I work with, she's probably, as the crow flies, two miles from me. I'm on the creek; she's on the creek. Obviously, we're in a very similar environment. She regularly gets purple honey; I've never gotten it.\" Laughing, she adds that it's a surprise even to the bee farmers when they open the hive and find it. \"Some years you get it, and then 10 years you don't.\"\nMore like this:\n•The unexpected origins of Houston's favourite po' boy\n•The US island that once belonged to Russia\n•The US's ancient, underrated culinary capital\nAnd here I am, a native to the state, with no idea such a wild-foraged wonder existed. Turns out some mysteries aren't just hidden; they're hidden in plain sight. That's the beauty of travel: not just the landscapes that render you speechless or the food that rewrites the rules, but the stories you stumble into along the way. The ones that don't come with tidy explanations or easy answers. There aren't many of those left.\nThere's something incredible about standing under a sky unbothered by city lights, surrounded by the literal hum of a place still untamed, knowing that not even the beekeepers – who spend their days elbow-deep in the stuff – can tell you why this honey defies nature's colour wheel. Maybe we'll never know. And perhaps that's the point. Some places keep their secrets – and that's precisely what makes them worth the trip.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "The sweltering heat during Buddhist New Year calls for Thailand's cooling khao chae, a fragrant and refreshing bowl of rice delicately scented with flowers.\nBy the timeSongkran, Thailand's new year based on the Buddhist calendar, arrives in April, the temperatures in the Southeast Asian country are soaring. The sky is typically blue and spotless, so reprieve under the shade of a passing cloud is non-existent while the humidity is as thick as a fleece blanket. One way to cool off is in the country-wide water fights that take place during the annual celebrations (this year from 13-15 April), which include water guns, buckets and coloured powder smeared onto the face like war paint. Another way to celebrate and cool off is to eatkhao chae.\nKhao chae (soaked rice) is an icy, seasonal treat that marks the beginning of summer in Thailand. The history of the dish can be traced back hundreds of years to theMon people, an ethnic group that originated throughout Myanmar and Thailand and integrated into what was then Siamese society in the 16th Century.\n[jump to recipe]\n\"The form of khao chae that we're looking at right now, especially in Bangkok, has very little resemblance to the Mon khao chae,\" says Leela Punyaratabandhu, a Thai scholar and the author of the 2017 cookbookBangkok, which includes a recipe for khao chae. In the 16th Century, the soaked rice porridge was served in terracotta pots to keep the dish cold because ice wasn't readily available. The accompanying side dishes were also not nearly as intricate as they would eventually become.\nIt was within the kingdom of Siam's royal family, dating back to King Rama IV's rule in the 19th Century, that the dish blossomed into something far more complex – a metamorphosis of its humble origins. A lot of effort was made to ensure that khao chae looked visually beautiful, so side dishes included delicately carved vegetables shaped into flowers. In addition, ice, which was impossible for commoners to get at the time, distinguished kaho chae as an exclusively royal dish.\nThe recipe that exists now has been passed down through generations of royal cooks and aristocratic families. The dish starts by vigorously washing jasmine rice to remove all the starch. \"You have to wash the rice more than regular steamed rice so it doesn't stick together when cooked,\" explains Max Wittawat, the executive chef of New York City'sBangkok Supper Club. Wittawat grew up in Bangkok and was taught to make khao chae by culinary artist and teacher Jantararat Hemvej, who is known in Bangkok for having perfected khao chae.\nSince the rice also needs to withstand being soaked for long periods without falling apart, which would render the dish cloudy, washing it is especially important. After it's steamed, the rice is submerged in ice water that's perfumed with the scent of flowers, ranging from jasmine, ylang ylang, damask roses and bread flowers. \"It's a mark of summer when the flowers bloom,\" adds Wittawat.\nPunyaratabandhu has childhood memories of her grandfather using a spreadsheet to track the specific times that the flowers bloomed in his garden. \"All of this was very systematic,\" she says. It's important to pick the flowers at the precise time – typically the evening before preparing khao chae – in order to achieve the optimal fragrance. From there, the flowers are submerged in water for at least two hours to imbue their aroma.\nEven the process of soaking the flowers is very intentional. If the flowers are left in the water for too long, they will bruise and go bad, leaving the water with a pungent and off-putting flavour. If they aren't steeped long enough, the bouquet will not be impactful enough to stand up to the side dishes served alongside khao chae. To enhance the dish's fragrance even further, aThai culinary candleknown astian opmay be used to smoke the flowery water.\nAnd that's just the base of the dish. Khao chae is an experience that includes many elaborate accoutrements. \"It's not only hard to make, but it's hard to eat as well,\" says Punyaratabandhu. This is because there are a lot of pungent, salty and fishy flavours that could be unfamiliar to some. \"Shrimp paste balls mixed with fish and then dipped in egg and fried? It's a far cry frompad see ew[stir-fried noodles].\"\nWhen Punyaratabandhu began writing her cookbook, she struggled with whether or not she should include a recipe for khao chae, knowing how impractical and challenging the dish can be to prepare at home. \"I knew it was going to be a tough sell, but also it's a part of Bangkok,\" she explains. \"My job was to be faithful to whatever is happening in Bangkok.\"\nMore like this:\n•A rice dish with 'sexual power'\n•The 3,000-year-old new year's celebration\n•The Thai noodles eaten for breakfast\nEven Wittawat admits that khao chae, outside of the aristocratic society of Bangkok, was not really in Thailand's zeitgeist until the past 10 years, when many chefs began reflecting on their Thai heritage and exploring culturally significant and historical dishes. \"Before that, it was very old school and not common in restaurants,\" he says. \"But nowadays, with technology, the flowers can bloom throughout the year, and it has risen so much in popularity.\"\nRecently, khao chae has become asocial media darlingdue to its myriad side dishes, like shrimp paste dumplings, elaborately carved vegetables, stuffed shallots and peppers, sweetened beef and pork jerky and delicate egg nests. It's visually stunning, especially when served in traditional Thai pots or tiffins. \"Sometimes, it's too pretty to eat,\" Wittawat says.\nThere is a particular way to enjoy the dish to avoid muddying the crystal-clear flower-scented water. \"You're not supposed to put all the condiments with the rice,\" Wittawat says. Instead, you should alternate eating the rice and side dishes. Vegetables and pickles can cut through the heavier flavours of sweetened beef and salty shrimp paste. \"This is the fun thing about khao chae,\" Wittawat says, acknowledging that the various flavours work in tandem to keep the meal fresh and exciting. \"You can continue eating more and more.\"\nWittawat is happy that khao chae, once exclusive to the royal family and upper echelon of Thai society, is now more readily available and accessible to everyone – especially during Songkran, when Thailand is so hot. \"Thai people are returning to their roots,\" he says. \"They're appreciating their history and culture.\nKhao chae recipe\nby Max Wittawat\nThis is a general overview of how to make the rice for khao chae, along with two side dishes. Feel free to include additional sides to your liking.\nRinse the jasmine rice in water 4 to 5 times. Cook the rice in boiling water until half-cooked, then strain. Wash the rice in water again, using your hands to rub the rice; rinse and repeat until the water becomes clear. Transfer the rice to a steamer and steam until fully cooked. Let cool.\nTo make the shrimp balls, blend all the ingredients (except the eggs and oil) in a blender until smooth. Pour into a large nonstick frying pan and cook until thick paste forms. Let cool slightly, then roll into small balls.\nHeat the oil in a medium pot. Dip the shrimp balls into beaten eggs, then deep-fry until golden brown. Set aside. (Reserve the oil for the green peppers.)\nPound the coriander, garlic and peppercorns in a mortar with a pestle until smooth, then mix with the minced pork and shrimp. Season with sugar and salt. Stuff the mixture into the green peppers. Set the peppers into a steamer and steam for 10mins.\nTo make the egg net, reheat the oil in the pot. Beat all the eggs together and strain through a sieve. Dip 5 fingers in the beaten eggs and shake into the pot of heated oil left to right, then up and down to form an egg net. When the eggs turn golden brown, transfer the egg net to a kitchen towel and place the steamed stuffed peppers on top, then roll the egg net around the peppers. Repeat with the remaining peppers.\nSpoon the steamed rice into bowls and pour the cold scented over it. Enjoy the khao chae with the shrimp balls and stuffed peppers, as well as sliced cucumber, green mango, scallion and lesser ginger.\nTo make the scented water, steep jasmine, ylang-ylang (กระดังงา) and chommanard (ชมนาด) flowers with drinking water and (if using) smoke with a Thai aromatic candle (เทียนหอม) overnight. Once the water is infused, strain it, then chill thoroughly.\nThis story was originally published in 2024.\nBBC.com'sWorld's Table\"smashes the kitchen ceiling\" by changing the way the world thinks about food, through the past, present and future.\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us onFacebook, or follow us onX,andInstagram.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday."

    "content": "Home to three Michelin-starred restaurants and a royal gingerbread legacy, the unassuming Lancashire town of Ormskirk is fast becoming the UK's most delicious destination.\nWhen it comes to UK destinations for a gourmet weekend away, there's a new name on the lips of serious foodies. Forget the metropolitan streets of Chelsea, Mayfair or even Edinburgh. Britain's latest gastronomic hotspot is in the rural hinterlands of deepest Lancashire.\nHolidaymakers journeying to this historic county in north-west England – a key location in theEnglishandIndustrialrevolutions – would have traditionally been heading for Blackpool, the classic British seaside resort whose best-known epicurean delight isBlackpool Rock, a tooth-shatteringly tough cylindrical stick of boiled sugar and glucose syrup.\nBut, for those with more refined palates – or more delicate dental work – the tastiest rewards are to be found in Ormskirk, a bustling market town that wasonce a Viking settlement, and in Aughton, the small village next door.\nIt's in this small village where Mark Birchall serves as chef patron ofMoor Hall, a produce-driven restaurant within the grounds of a Grade II-listed, 16th-Century manor house. And at this year's Michelin awards, he was the only chef in Britain and Ireland to have been awarded athird Michelin star. As such, he has become one of only 10 chefs in the country (and fewer than 150 in the entire world) to hold the three-star accolade, a designation signalling that, according to thetyre company's inspectors, a restaurant isworth making a dedicated journeyfor.\nNo stranger to recognition, Moor Hall was votedBest Restaurant in Englandin the 2023 National Restaurant Awards, and also possesses agreen Michelin starfor the sustainable cooking practices used to create its 18-course tasting menu. Additionally, Birchall's \"neighbourhood restaurant\",The Barn(offering more casual dining at a lower price point), is a mere 30 second stroll around the lake from Moor Hall and possesses a Michelin star of its very own too.\nAs if that weren't enough, less than 10 minutes' walk away is Chef Tim Allen's restaurantsō-lōwhich has a Michelin star as well, bringing the total to a rather stellar six in the space of less than half a mile.\nSo what makes the food so special in this part of Lancashire, I ask Birchall as he forages for micro herbs and other ingredients on Moor Hall's six-acre country estate, dotted with secluded luxurygarden roomswhere diners can stay.\n\"Aughton and Ormskirk have a deep-rooted connection to the land, and that plays a massive part in why the food here is so special,\" he tells me. \"The landscape, the soil, the weather – it all contributes to the quality of the produce. We're lucky to have incredibly fertile, well-draining soil, which means the fruit and vegetables – particularly leafy greens, brassicas and root veg – even the grass that feeds the livestock, are all packed with flavour.\"\nIndeed, the West Lancashire coastal plain between Preston and Southport is often referred to as \"the salad bowl of England\". According to the National Farmers Union, England's north-west region accounts for 15% of the country's food production, leading them to call it \"Britain'sfarming powerhouse\".\n\"The climate, too, plays its role,\" Birchall continues. \"We get just the right balance – enough rain to keep things abundant, but not so much that it drowns the land. That allows for a longer growing season, and when you combine that with generations of skilled farmers who understand how to work with the land, you get outstanding ingredients. It's that connection between produce and place that really sets the region apart.\"\nAllen agrees with Birchall, with whom he consulted before opening sō-lō. He has seen an influx of foodies not just from London (which is a little more than two hours away by train) but from right across the globe. \"We get people coming from America, Mexico, Norway, Finland, even Singapore,\" Allen tells me.\n\"But also, because we're located midway between Liverpool and Manchester – whose football teams (Everton, Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United) are massive – you get a lot of people travelling for the football. And many of them, it turns out, quite like eating Michelin-starred food.\"\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, these discerning fans eschew the plastic platefuls of pie and chips usually consumed on the terraces to partake of Allen's altogether more elevated offerings; dishes made with ingredients such asLouet Fessier oysteremulsion, Oscietra caviar and salt-baked celeriac (which he employs somebody to grow purely for sō-lō'sseven-course tasting menu).\nBut this part of Lancashire offers more than the ultra-modern cordon bleu cuisine of Moor Hall and sō-lō; travellers in search of the area's deepest culinary roots may find them at the famousOmskirk Market. Held on Thursdays and Saturdays, it is one of the country's oldest (King Edward I granted it a Royal Charter in 1286) and is where you can sample the town's original claim to culinary fame: gingerbread.\nAs far back as 1732, recipes for the spicy baked treat were being passed down through generations of Ormskirkers. Sellers – almost exclusively women identified by their white shawls and aprons – would tout fresh gingerbread to passengers on the stagecoaches that stopped at the inns along Aughton Street on their way from Liverpool to Preston. When Ormskirk railway station opened in 1849, the women switched to targeting train passengers.\nMore like this:\n•The English wine that's rivalling Champagne\n•Is the future of French cheese at stake?\n•The surprising 'lesbian capital of the UK'\n\"They would make their way along the platform, loudly knocking on all the carriage windows crying out 'Gingerbread! Who will buy my freshly baked gingerbread?',\" explains Kathryn MacDonald of theOrmskirk and District Family History Society. \"There were so many of them and they were such persuasive sellers that Ormskirk's gingerbread women became well known around the region. So when, in 1885, the Prince of Wales alighted here – he was going to a shooting party at nearbyLathom House– there was a welcome reception put on for him at the station and three of the gingerbread women were allowed to present the Prince with a gift of Ormskirk gingerbread. A few years later, when he became king (Edward VII), he'd stop the royal train at Ormskirk on his way up to Balmoral, and stock up with supplies for himself and the royal family. So, he obviously must have really liked our gingerbread!\"\nThe white-aproned women no longer ply their wares at the station, but one baker of Ormskirk gingerbread can still be found today in the town.Mr Thompson's Bakeryis a family business run by Neil Thompson, his wife Janet and daughter Lilli who bake the treats in a converted shed in their back garden.\n\"Back in 2010, we revived an ancient Ormskirk gingerbread recipe but made some tweaks, such as using less salt, to suit modern tastes,\" says Lilli, who mans their stall each week at Ormskirk's famous food market.\nThe Thompsons' bakery, which has appeared in an episode of BBC TV'sThe Hairy Bikers Go West, is also carrying on the town's tradition of reeling in royalty with its legendary gingerbread. Janet reveals how she and Lilli were given the honour, when Princess Anne visited Ormskirk in 2022 to open a new facility atEdge Hill University, of including some of their gingerbread in a welcome hamper.\n\"Has she come back since to stock up with supplies, like her great-grandfather Edward VII did?\" I ask.\n\"Not as far I know,\" she laughs, \"but I'd like to think there's a secret stash of Ormskirk gingerbread somewhere in one of the larders of Buckingham Palace!\"\nEach year the town hostsOrmskirk Gingerbread Festivalwhich, this year, is scheduled to take place on 13 July. The family-friendly event allows locals and visitors to learn more about the town's culinary heritage, and some women dress up in white shawls and aprons to honour Ormskirk's most famous gingerbread hawkers.\nIt's also an opportunity to celebrate this unassuming pocket of Lancashire that has quietly become a food lover's destination in its own right – no small achievement in a country where most culinary trends tend to point south. Whether you come for the royal gingerbread, the six Michelin stars or the rich farming roots that nourish it all, Ormskirk delivers the goods… and they’re anything but half-baked.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "For 16 generations, master gardeners in this one family have dedicated their lives to preserving one of the nation's most cherished – and highly sought-out – symbols.\nEach spring duringsakura(cherry blossom) season, theNinna-jiandDaikaku-jitemples in Kyoto's leafy Ukyo ward are overwhelmed by busloads of tourists who come to snap photos of the temples' blooming cherry trees. But little do they know that only a few kilometres away, there's a secret sakura garden hiding in plain sight.\nThis 1.5-hectare public plot, known as theSano family garden, is an oasis of calm; found just off an unassuming street near traditional woodenmachiyatownhouses. But this isn't just any ordinary cherry blossom tree grove; it's also the domain of 97-year-old Tōemon Sano: Japan's most renownedsakuramori(cherry blossom guardian).\nFor more than a millennium, Japanese people have admired the delicate sakura petals as a symbol of transience and beauty. Today, this national pastime has blossomed into an international obsession, withmillions of touristsfrom across the world descending on Japan to sip seasonal sakura-themed Starbucks drinks and participate inhanami(cherry blossom viewing) picnics and festivals from March to May. But while the world waits with bated breath for the cotton candy-coloured blossoms to burst each spring, one of the most important and least understood roles in the trees' maintenance lies with their behind-the-scenes caretakers.\nAccording to Naoko Abe, cherry blossom expert and author ofThe Sakura Obsession, skilled sakura arborists have existed in Japan since time immemorial. But thanks to the popularity of the 1970s novel Sakuramori about a sakura-infatuated tree expert, communities began bestowing this title to deserving specialists in the years that followed. Typically a professional gardener or tree surgeon, a sakuramori is a combination of Lorax, botanist and spiritual guide dedicated to studying sakura and promoting their preservation.\nAs Asada Nobuyuki, the secretary general of the Japan Sakura Association, explained, there are roughly 100 sakuramori in Japan today, but one stands out. \"It can be said that Tōemon Sano is most deserving of the title sakuramori,\" said Nobuyuki, crediting the breadth of Sano's long, productive career and his family's generational wisdom.\nOn a Friday morning earlier this month, I crunched through gravel at this historic sanctuary to meet Sano himself. He is the 16th generation in a distinguished line of farmers who began cultivating the nearby land (known for its late-blooming dwarf cherry trees) in the mid-1600s. When his father died in 1981, he assumed the first name Tōemon, per family tradition, and took the reins of Uetō Zōen, the landscaping firm his family started in 1832 that is headquartered in the garden.\nFor more than 80 years,Sano has utilised his specialised knowledge to steward the survival of sakura trees in gardens throughout Japan and the world – including at the Isamu Noguchi-designedJapanese garden at the Unesco headquartersin Paris. Sakura Taikan, his most famous book, is the definitive tome on the trees and the culmination of research begun by his grandfather during the Taishō period (1912–1926).\nBut just before our visit, the nonagenarian became ill and was rushed to hospital. Still, he arranged for me to meet his son, Shinichi Sano, who oversees operations at Uetō Zōen and who will one day succeed his father and carry on the family legacy as the next Tōemon and sakuramori.\nAs we strolled through the garden, Shinichi paused at an umbrella-likeshidarezakura(weeping cherry), its swooping branches covered in geisha-blush blossoms. Shinichi said this 40-year-old tree was grown from the seeds of the most iconic sakura in Kyoto: the dramatic weepingcherry tree in Maruyama Park, which was originally grown in the Sano family garden and replanted in its current public spot by Tōemon's father, the 15th Tōemon Sano.\nThough sakura have attracted hanami lovers for generations, Shinichi said a major threat now looms over them: climate change. According to theJapan Meteorological Agency, cherry blossoms have started to bloom 1.2 days earlier per decade since 1953. A recentstudyfound that the peak bloom of Kyoto's cherry blossoms in 2020, 2021 and 2023 were the earliest in more than 1,200 years.\n\"If global warming continues at this rate, I believe there will eventually be regions in Japan where cherry trees no longer bloom,\" Shinichi said, noting that winters with elevated temperatures could nip blooms in the bud entirely, as trees require a sustained chill to initiate the blossoming process. If this happens, a major part of Japan's springtime tourism appeal would be jeopardised – as well as an integral part of the nation's cultural identity.\n\"The reason Japanese people are fond of cherry blossoms is because, after enduring a harsh winter, the vivid flowers bloom in the monochrome landscape as if to herald the long-awaited arrival of spring. This quiet presence is what draws people in and resonates deeply in our hearts,\" Tōemon later told me over email after being released from hospital. \"Out of 365 days a year, the cherry blossoms endure wind and snow for 360 days, only to bloom gloriously for five days before gracefully scattering. I believe this fleeting yet dignified cycle reflects the Japanese perspective on life. There may be a sense of personification in the way we view the cherry blossom, as if it embodies a spiritual or moral belief that, through patience and perseverance, one will eventually bloom.\"\nCherry blossoms are integral to the Japanese psyche and soul. In ancient Japan,kami(deities) were said to reside in the trees. Beginning in the 800s, Emperor Saga (whose former residence is up the road from the Sano family garden at Daikaku-ji) ushered in the practice of hanami with official cherry blossom viewing parties. For samurai during the Kamakura period (1185-1333),sakura became a unifying military symbolfor the warriors to fall with dignity and grace – a message echoed during World War Two for kamikaze pilots. In light of this national importance, protecting sakura and ensuring their sustainability is something Japan takes seriously.\nToday, according to Abe, many of the mostfamous placestravellers go to see sakura in Japan, such asMount Yoshinoin Nara andMatsumae Parkin Hokkaido, each have a dedicated sakuramori. Interestingly, Tōemon and his family's unbroken line of Japanese gardeners may not have risen to the level of sakuramori were it not for a British botanist.\nIn 1902, English naturalistCollingwood \"Cherry\" Ingrambecame fascinated by Japanese cherry trees during his first visit to the nation, but he lamented how industrialisation and cloning had led to a decline in their diversity. In an effort to protect them, he sent 50 endangered varieties back to England and planted them in his garden. When he eventually tried to propagate the varieties back in Japan come the 1930s, including the rare Taihaku cherry that had ceased to be cultivated in Japan, the trees didn't survive long.\nGiven the Sano family's generational expertise, Ingram sought out Tōemon's grandfather, who developed a way to transport the trees successfully so they wouldn't sprout before arriving in Japan. From that little shipment of Taihaku trees, it is thought that tens of thousands of Tahihaku now flourish across Japan and were saved from national extinction.\nTōemon's grandfather became something of a Johnny Appleseed for sakura – taking grafts and growing saplings, venturing to far-flung places like the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin before he died in 1934. Tōemon's father then took up the mantle while training his son to continue the family legacy.\nToday, travellers enjoying the mesmerising weeping cherry in Maruyama Park have Tōemon to thank, as the city asks him to care for the tree throughout the year. Visitors can also admire Tōemon's work at the Ruriko-in estate, where sakura stand in stunning harmony on the property close to the Golden Pavilion of Kinkakuji; the Katsura Imperial Villa; the Shukaguin Imperial Villa; Ninna-ji Temple garden; and, of course, at the nearby Sano family property.\nEven at 97, Tōemon still collects information on different types of sakura and makes detailed drawings of the blossoms' anatomy from the stamen and pistils to the bracts and peduncles – all to better understand how to help sakura flourish.\n\"My feelings toward cherry blossoms are something that has been ingrained in my daily life,\" Tōemon said. \"My daily life follows the old Japanese way of lifeseikō-udoku, 'working in the fields when it's sunny and reading when it rains'… If I am asked to preserve rare cherry blossoms, I respond by grafting or sowing seeds.\"\nMore like this:\n•The 96-year-old painter who saved a village\n•The 89-year-old woman who is still travelling the world solo\n•Japan's unusual way to view the world\nTo that end, he has successfully propagated cherry trees in the atomic bomb-ravaged soil of Hiroshima and saved a 150-year-old Oshima cherry tree in Yokohama that was destined to be cut down. In that instance, when the local community enlisted him to relocate the storied sakura 100m away to preserve an iconic view of Mt Fuji, he took careful stock of the three layers of soil surrounding the tree. Before digging, Tōemon ceremonially placed sake and rice crackers in the dirt as an apology for the disruption, added charcoal and provided an octopus offering. Also known to hug trees, Tōemon embraced the trunk tightly upon its successful replanting.\nAs I toured the Sano family garden, falling cherry petals fluttered to the ground like snowflakes, a phenomenon calledsakura fubuki. In addition to kami, the souls of ancestors are also said to reside in the flowering cherry blossoms, connecting the Sano family to their forebearers and representing the fleeting nature of each generation. Amid this transient beauty, the Japanese concept of \"mono no aware\" (the wistful recognition of life's ephemerality and the beauty in that impermanence) feels especially present.\n\"Cherry blossoms reflect the way of life of the samurai in the old days: beautiful in the way they fall with grace and dignity,\" Shinichi said. Shinichi's 38-year-old son, Tomoaki, who has started to take over day-to-day responsibilities in the family business, has one child – a daughter. It would then be possible to have the first female sakuramori in this line.\n\"It will depend on her decision,\" Shinichi said.\nFor now, though, the family is allowing the 16th Tōemon Sano to focus his attentions on what he does best.\n\"While my father is healthy, he will be the one to take care of the sakura,\" Shinichi said. I then asked if he felt he would one day be ready to assume the role of Tōemon Sano and sakuramori.\n\"I won't really know until I actually become the 17th generation,\" Shinichi said. \"I think I will truly feel the responsibility for the first time when I actually inherit the name… I'll do what I'm asked to.\"\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "He had tea with the Queen, was blessed by the Pope and spread Hawaiian culture across the globe. More than a century later, a festival dubbed the \"Olympics of hula\" honours his legacy.\nSilence engulfed the audience at Edith Kanaka'ole Stadium in Hilo, Hawai'i, as a group of hula dancers appeared on stage. They moved gracefully in unison, rhythmically depicting a scene of an ancient Hawaiian myth as they bellowedmele(chants). The hula performance, which was part of the annual Merrie Monarch Festival, wasn't a mere spectacle; it was a powerful celebration of Hawaiian culture – and for years, it was banned.\nThe week-longMerrie Monarch Festival(which takes place 20-26 April 2025 and is celebrating its 62nd anniversary) has been called the \"Olympics of hula\" and perpetuates the sacred, centuries-old practice of dancing and chanting that preserves and portrays our native Hawaiian language, history, religion and culture. Every year, thousands of Hawaiians descend on the Big Island to attend the event, while thousands more watch live broadcasts of Hawai'i's 23 besthālau(hula groups) compete on TV. Yet, the festival is more than just a hula contest; its dance performances, arts and craft exhibitions, and a royal parade through downtown Hilo is considered the biggest display of Hawaiian culture in the world.\n\"It's the one week out of the year where we celebrate being Hawaiian,\" saidKū Kahakalau, a Hawaiian language and culture expert. \"And it's all thanks to the undertakings of King Kalākaua.\"\nFondly dubbed \"The Merrie Monarch\", King David La'amea Kalākaua was the last king of Hawai'i. He ruled the Kingdom of Hawai'i from 1874 until his death in 1891, but his ascension to the throne was nothing short of contentious. Shortly after the death of King Kamehameha IV, whose family had ruled the kingdom since 1795, Hawai'i's legislature decided to elect a nativeali'i(noble chief) instead of the king's widow. The decision incited a full-blown riot. As the queen's supporters stormed the Honolulu courthouse, British and American sailors stationed at Honolulu harbour were called in to quell the fighting and Kalākaua took the oath of office the following day.\nBy the time of Kalākaua's reign, Native Hawaiian heritage was at great risk. Christian missionaries had begun arriving on the islands in 1820, introducing diseases that killed Native Hawaiians, converting islanders away from our traditional polytheistic religion and infiltrating the political system to suppress local culture and beliefs. One of the most significant ways they did this was by banning public performances of the hula, a dance missionaries deemed \"vile heathen chants\".\nKalākaua sought to restore a unified sense of national pride among Hawaiians, and his reign marked a period of cultural renaissance across the islands. He lived by the mottoHo'oulu Lāhui(Increase the Nation) and sought to remake Hawai'i for Hawaiians – all of which resulted in the revival of traditional customs such as language, music, arts and traditional medicines that had long been suppressed during the missionary-influenced era of his predecessors. One of his crowning achievements was preserving the hula. As Kalākaua famously proclaimed: \"Hula is the language of the heart, and therefore the heartbeat of the Hawaiian people.\"\nTo many people around the world, \"hula\" may conjure images of tiki bars, plastic dancers shaking their hips on car dashboards or something that only happens at beachside resorts. But long before hula was commodified and appropriated, it was a sacred dance among Native Hawaiians – an ancient practice that served as an archive of our stories, beliefs and way of life. Prior to the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778, there was no written language in Hawai'i. Instead, ancient Hawaiians used oral tradition and hula to pass on their identity and culture from one generation to the next. Even when practice was prohibited, Hawaiians took hula underground, continuing to teach the forbidden dance in secret in caves and far-flung areas.\nAs part of Kalākaua's Ho'oulu Lāhui policy, hula experienced a resurgence. In fact, the king's lavish two-week coronation ceremony was essentially a celebration of Native Hawaiian culture, featuring traditional music, hula and lū'au – all of which had previously been banned. To commemorate his 50th birthday three years later,ho'opa'a(chanters) and'ōlapa(dancers) performed in public for the first time in years, while a parade wound its way through downtown Honolulu. Today, the Merrie Monarch Festival pays tribute to the proud sense of Hawaiian identity Kalākaua revived.\n[Kalākaua] was deeply committed, proud and knowledgeable about his Hawaiian heritage,\" said Kahakalau, noting that the king was also the first person to have theKumulipo(a creation chant that also includes the genealogy of Hawaiian royalty) written down.\nYet, Kalākaua wasn't just content to revive Hawaiian customs in Hawai'i; he wanted to share the Kingdom's culture around the world. So, in 1881, the \"Merrie Monarch\" continued the proud Hawaiian tradition of long-distance seafaring byspending 281 days circumnavigating the globe, becoming the first head of state to travel around the world.\nDuring Kalākaua's international diplomacy tour, he was greeted by the Emperor of Japan to the sounds ofHawai'i Pono'ī(the Kingdom's national anthem, which Kalākaua had written); he proposed immigration policies with Chinese politicians; he toured the Great Sphinx with the Khedive of Egypt; he was blessed by Pope Leo XIII in Rome; he had tea with Queen Victoria of England, and he boarded a train that was struck by a bull in Spain. In New York, Kalākaua met with Thomas Edison to discuss the possibility of getting electricity to Honolulu. In 1886, the king's wish came true.'Iolani Palace(which is now a museum and the only royal residence in the United States), became illuminated with electric lights – five years before the White House did.\n\"He was able to build important relationships, create liaisons, and sign treaties with multiple countries [that benefitted our people],\" said Kenneth \"Aloha\" Victor, akumu hula(master hula teacher) and designer ofKaulua'e, a made-in-Hawai'i clothing and lifestyle brand. In addition to sending envoys to Europe and Asia, Kalākaua maintained consulates and legations in more than130 citiesacross the globe. The Kingdom had13 consulates in Great Britain alone.\nBack at home, during an era of increased literacy, Kalākaua met with traditionalna kahuna(priests) andna kapuna(elders) to compile many of the ancient Hawaiian myths and chants that are portrayed through hula and mele and write them in Hawaiian. In 1888, he took things one step further and translated these stories into English for the first time in the book,Legends and Myths of Hawai'i, which he often presented as gifts to foreign dignitaries so they'd get a better understanding of Hawai'i, its culture and its people.\nMore like this:\n•The word embodying the spirit of Hawai'i\n•A lei maker's guide to the real Honolulu\n•Hawaii's ancient land management system\nKalākaua's mission to integrate Hawai'i with the rest of the world also resulted in the creation of theHawaiian Youths Abroad Program, in which the king selected young Hawaiians whom he felt could become future leaders of the Kingdom and sent them abroad to study things like medicine, law, engineering, foreign languages and art. More than 100 years later, the programme's legacy still echoes across the islands:Princess Abigail Kawānanakoa, the granddaughter of one of the students the king sent abroad, played an instrumental role in restoring 'Iolani Palace and was a staunch supporter of native Hawaiian rights until her death in 2022.\nA multi-hyphenate in every sense of the word, Kalākaua embraced modernity just as much as he valued Hawaiian culture. He was a voracious inventor, designing blueprints for tornado-proof ships, fish-shaped torpedoes, sealed bottle caps and rangefinder scopes. He even had a telephone installed that connected 'Iolani Palace where he lived and worked to his private boathouse less than a mile away, where he'd often be foundhosting royal lū'ausfor foreign dignitaries and heads of state.\nFor Hawaiians today, Kalākaua is much more than just a Renaissance man. \"When Kalākaua travelled [abroad], he promoted and shared our culture with the world,\" said Ana Kon, a Hawaiian cultural specialist based in Hilo. \"It's why, more than a century later, we continue to honour his legacy today at the Merrie Monarch Festival.\"\nFor those unable to snag tickets to the Merrie Monarch Festival's highly coveted hula competitions, there are still plenty of opportunities to participate in the festivities. Hilo's Afook-Chinen Civic Auditorium and Butler Buildings host a vibrant arts and crafts fair featuring the creations of more than 150 local artisans and brands from across Hawai'i. \"Our 'aloha wear' is a celebration of hula,\" said Victor, of his clothing, which he said honours the people, places and movements in Hawaiian culture.\nOf course, Kalākaua's legacy lives on beyond the festival. In many ways, every hula step, lū'au gathering and Hawaiian-language phrase is a nod back to our last king's efforts to revive our customs at home and introduce them around the world. Visitors can experience this first hand at O'ahu'sPolynesian Cultural Center, which hosts a traditional Hawaiian lū'au paying homage to Queen Lili'uokalani (Kalākaua's sister, who succeeded him until white businessmenoverthrew the Kingdom in 1893), while theQueen Emma Summer Palacein Honolulu offers contemporary hula lessons for adults.\nOn Maui, immersive experiences at theGrand Waileainclude anE Ala Eoli(chant) in the mornings on the beach, while interactive language lessons teach guests how to pronounce words inʻŌlelo Hawai'i(Hawaiian). Beachside resorts likeOutrigger Reef in Waikiki Beachare adopting a regenerative tourism approach at itsA'o Cultural Centerby allowing guests to meet traditional Hawaiian navigators and canoe builders, teaching them how to use traditional Hawaiian tools and – yes – participate in hula lessons.\n\"It all spawns back to [King Kalākaua's] creed,\" said Victor. \"That hula is the heartbeat of our Hawaiian people.\"\nCORRECTION:A previous version of this story stated that US sugar planters overthrew the Kingdom of Hawai'i.

    "content": "As the UK celebrates the writer's 250th birthday, there's never been a better time to explore the dramatic bluffs and picture-perfect villages connected to her most famous novel.\n\"There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire,\" wrote 19th-Century novelist Jane Austen in Pride and Prejudice, arguably her most famous novel. Indeed, its idyllic stone villages and towns, verdant valleys, deep caverns, towering gritstone edges and windswept moorlands make the East Midlands county one of the best places to enjoy England's great outdoors.\nDerbyshireplayed a starring role in Austen's novel, shining particularly in the latter half when its heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, travels north from Hertfordshire to thePeak Districtand is reunited with the book's romantic hero, Mr Darcy. Joe Wright's 2005 film adaptation brought the stunning scenery to the big screen, leadingtravellers to flock to Derbyshireand see the sights through their own eyes.\nYet, according to Hazel Jones, editor of theJane Austen Society's Annual Report, there is no evidence that Austen actually ever visited Derbyshire. Instead, Austen would have read romanticised descriptions in contemporary journals of the county, which experienced a Georgian period boom in tourism, and completed \"scrupulous research\", says Jones.\n\"We just have to trust Jane Austen's instinct that Derbyshire is the perfect county for Pemberley [Mr Darcy's home] says Jones. \"It is, after all, far enough away from Mrs Bennet.\"\nThis year not only marks the250th anniversary of Austen's birthbut also the 30th anniversary of the adaptedBBC miniseriesand the 20th anniversary of the four-time Oscar-nominated film – which will bere-released in select cinemas in the UK, US and Australia starting 20 April. As the weather warms and wildflowers blanket the region, it's an opportune time to explore the many landmarks and filming locations connected to one of the world's great love stories.\nAny tour of Austen's Derbyshire should begin atChatsworth House. Fittingly, the opulent Grade I-listed estate and stables were transformed into Pemberley, the home of Pride and Prejudice's wealthy suitor, Mr Darcy, in the 2005 film.\nChatsworth sits on 1,822 manicured acres on the banks of the Derwent river, and it is home to herds of deer and sheep as well as wild animals. Owned and lived in by17 generationsof the Devonshire family, it opened its doors to the public in 1708.\nToday, visitors can tour the stately home to admireone of Europe's most significant private art collections, whose paintings, rare books and historical documents span more than four centuries. Visitors will eventually come to the sculpture gallery, which fans of the film will recognise – particularly theVeiled Vestal. Keep your eyes peeled in the gift shop for a bust of Darcy's head, though, unfortunately, it's not available to purchase – or kiss!\nWhile you could easily spend a day exploring Chatsworth's 105-acregarden, dipping your toes into the 300-year-oldCascadewaterfall, winding through the giantmazeor running around theWillow Tree Fountain(a brass tree that might just soak you when standing underneath it), there are plenty offree walksyou can take around the estate too.\nDerbyshire is home to many of England's finest aristocratic houses – includingSudbury Hall, which was used for the interior shots of Pemberley in the BBC adaption. And just a five-minute drive south of the town of Bakewell isHaddon Hall, which has been owned by the Manners family for the last 900 years. There's something magical about this country house, especially when the pale pink and red roses adorn the walls in the summer months. Wandering through the Elizabethan gardens feels like you're stepping back in time.\nFilm location scouts agree. Haddon Hall's medieval and Tudor architecture was also featured in Franco Zeffirelli's adaptation of Jane Eyre, The Princess Bride film, and more recently,Firebrand. Fans of the Pride & Prejudice film may recognise the wood-panelled banqueting hall, which served as the interiors of the fictional Inn at Lambton; and the parlour, which became Elizabeth Bennet's bedroom.\n\"There's a palpable magic at Haddon Hall, where centuries-old architecture meets the vibrant hues of summer,\" says Julie Mellor, filming coordinator at Haddon. \"Beyond its visual splendour, Haddon offers a sanctuary of learning and culture.\"\nHaddon runs a specialistfilm tourwith experts who have been on the film sets, as well as variety of workshops and events ranging from art and craft sessions to ecological walks. \"It's an idyllic setting that encourages reflection and discovery, making summer 2025 an ideal time to experience the romance and elegance that define it,\" says Mellor.\nAccording tolocal lore, Austen stayed inBakewellat theRutland Arms Hoteland wrote much of Pride and Prejudice here. Some Austen experts dispute this claim, yet she does reference the market town in the novel as Elizabeth travels through it on her way to Pemberley.\nMore like this:\n•How to celebrate Jane Austen on her 250th anniversary\n•A Tolkien trail: Where to find the real-life Middle-earth\n•Britain's tastiest town: Where Michelin chefs and gingerbread chefs reign\nSet on the banks of the river Wye, bustling Bakewell is ideally situated between Chatsworth House and Haddon Hall. It's also the start of the 8.5-mile walking, jogging, cycling and wheelchair-accessibleMonsal Trail, built atop a former Manchester-to-London railway line.\nBakewell is home to two traditional English sweet treats: theBakewell pudding and Bakewell tart. For an authentic taste of both, head toThe Old Original Bakewell Pudding Shop, which has sold the former since the 1800s (made with their secret recipe), and now sells tarts too.\nIn the film adaptation, Bennet's arrival in Derbyshire is marked with an iconic shot of actress Keira Knightley standing atop the four-mile-long gritstone ridge ofStanage Edge, looking out onto the vast and dramatic Hope Valley beneath her. Two decades later, many Pride and Prejudice fans scour the Edge to find the exact spot where the actress stood – so much so it's often called \"Keira Knightley rock\".\nThe windswept landmark's rugged terrain attracts climbers and hikers from across the country. Geologist Rob Donnelly tells the BBC that Stanage Edge's millstone grit is emblematic of thePeak District National Park(you will spot the circular stones as you travel around). \"The gritstone edges form part of the Peak District's unique landscape,\" he says. \"They are an iconic rock type in the region, having been laid down roughly 300 million years ago.\"\nThe Edge overlooks the village ofHathersage(reached via a six-mile walk through trails and woodland or a short drive), whose heated 30moutdoor poolmakes for a scenic swim.\nSet in the Peak District's south-eastern side and characterised as \"celebrated beauties\" by Austen are the twin towns ofMatlock and Matlock Bath. Bennet travels through both locales on her way to Pemberley, and these namesake neighbours (Matlock is slightly bigger and lies about one mile north), are great bases for a stay in Derbyshire, with good transport connections, independent shops and cafes.\nThe spa resort of Matlock Bath is frequently described as a seaside town without the sea. It has attracted visitors since the late17th Century, when its thermal springs (which had previously been discovered and mined by the Romans) became used for medicinal purposes. Today, there is a historicoutdoor swimming poolfed by mineral-rich natural spring water tucked around the back of the New Matlock Bath Hotel & Spa.\nAusten was likely well aware of the town's famed thermal waters. When Bennet enters Derbyshire with apprehension about seeing Darcy, she says, \"But surely … I may enter his county without impunity and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.\" Austen might have been referring to Matlock Bath'spetrifying well– where the mineral-rich thermal water, turns objects into stone.\nMatlock is also popular with walkers as it lies in a valley of the River Derwent. Pride and Prejudice fans may opt to explore the fittingly namedLovers' Walks, a series of footpaths along the riverside, or if you'd prefer something more challenging, there are alsotrailsthat go up and over the wooded cliffs. But perhaps the most famous tourist attraction is theHeights of Abraham, where you can take a mountain cable car to the top of Masson Hill, a 60-acre hilltop estate with a panoramic view of the surrounding valley and town below.\nIt is remarkable to think that an author who may not have set foot in Derbyshire cast such a bright light on the county. By intertwining real places into her narrative, Austen masterfully carried the reader along with Bennet on her journey through Derbyshire to reconcile with Darcy. As Jones says in her bookJane Austen's Journeys, \"What should be a truth universally acknowledged is that Jane Austen knew exactly what she was doing when she sent her liveliest heroine on the road north to Pemberley.\"\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "Finland has topped the World Happiness Rankings for the eighth year running – but the real appeal for travellers lies in the country's deeply-lived values of balance, nature and everyday contentment.\nFinns tend to accept the accolade of supreme happiness, bestowed on them by the UN'sWorld Happiness Reportin March 2025 for the eighth time in a row, with a collective shrug and eye roll. But Finnish travel operators are celebrating as travellers increasingly make theconnection between Finland and happiness, hoping to come and experience that Finnish brand of happiness for themselves.\nHowever, don't expect to be greeted with howls of laughter and cheerful quips when you land at Helsinki Airport or disembark from one of the Baltic ferries in the capital's harbour. There is some truth in the perception of Finland beinga no-nonsense, down-to-earth kind of nation. Generally, Finns are flattered –happy, even – to be honoured by the report's conclusions, but while graciously accepting them, they feel \"happiness\" isn't really the right word. Instead, \"contentment\", \"fulfilment\" or \"life satisfaction\" are widely considered more appropriate terms. As Finnish President Alexander Stubb recentlyposted on Facebook: \"No one can be happy all the time, and sometimes circumstance makes it difficult. But getting the basics right – security, freedom and equality – is a good start.\"\nBut while the concept of happiness in Finland may be nuanced and culturally specific, it is deeply embedded in the fabric of daily life. Rather than seeking constant highs, the Finnish approach is rooted in balance, connection and quiet contentment – qualities that increasingly resonate with visitors. And for travellers, this state of being is not just something to observe but one to get involved with first-hand, through embracing the country's nature, sauna culture, food, sustainable design and lifestyle.\n\"We see Finnish happiness as a summary of these five elements,\" says Teemu Ahola, director of international operations at Visit Finland, \"but we don't measure or collect data to evaluate happiness as a single attraction in itself\".\nTo experience these tangible, authentic aspects of Finnish life that underpin its consistent happiness ranking, Ahola suggests Finnish sauna culture as an increasingly popular, most globally identifiable attraction; and stresses that Finland is a safe country, naming the risk of bumping into free-roaming reindeer in northern Lapland as one of the few potential hazards for visiting tourists. Meanwhile, he adds, a new and confident generation of Finnish chefs has earned international respect for and interest in the Finnish culinary scene.\nFinland is home to the world's northernmost Michelin star restaurant,Tapio, in Ruka-Kuusamo; and the Saimaa Lakeland region was named aEuropean Region of Gastronomyin 2024. Many restaurants across Helsinki celebrate the edible riches – mushrooms, berries, fish and game – that are accessible to all in the country's endless forests, coastal archipelagos and inland waterways through Finland'sJokaisenoikeudetor \"Everyman's Right\", a law that grants everyone the freedom to roam and forage.\nHelsinki, where most visitors start or end their trip, offers a first-hand glimpse of this national contentment. This is a seaside city, spread over a beautiful natural archipelago and reclaimed land. It's easy to grab acity bikefrom one of the dozens of stands around town and head off to explore the coast-hugging cycling routes or disappear intoCentral Park, a belt of forest that stretches from the city centre to its northern periphery.\nThe endorphin boost experienced by this kind of freewheeling adventure and access to plentiful natural resources ties directly into the UN's happiness metrics of life expectancy, freedom and positive emotions. This connection can be found at the heart ofSaimaaLife, a nature and wellness company in eastern Finland's sprawling Saimaa Lakeland region, run by mental health expert and guide Mari Ahonen.\nAhonen is an enthusiastic advocate of the mental balance that Finnish nature and lifestyle have to offer and leads her guests through shinrin-yoku (forest bathing), traditional lakeside saunas, wild swimming, foraging trips for mushrooms and berries and cooking over an open fire.\n\"We Finns can be too modest,\" she says. \"We should notice the World Happiness status in a positive way. I'm a living example of having been able to develop a business with the support that has been available for my entrepreneurship. Some people say it's a lottery win to be born in Finland.\"\nA lottery win, that is, in the form of life satisfaction and balance; of living comfortably and having \"enough\" in a material sense. This ceiling of expectation shouldn't be confused with a lack of ambition or resourcefulness. After all, this is the birthplace of mobile communications pioneerNokia, the distinctive garden tool and scissor brandFiskarsand textile and clothing iconMarimekko.\nFinland isn't immune from economic pressure or controversies, however, and the long, dark winters can put a strain on mental health. The Finnish idea of happiness also includes a dose ofsisu: a hard-to-translate concept of resilience, fortitude, courage and grit. Finnish-Canadian author Katja Pantzar, who has written extensively about this perceived national quality, explains that it's \"a mindset that allows people and communities to work together in the face of challenges rather than give up or blame and attack others\".\nMore like this:\n•The 25 best places to travel in 2025\n•The European region where young people are happiest\n•Turku: Finland's under-the-radar Nordic destination\nShe notes that the top four nations in the World Happiness Report are all Nordic countries with strong welfare systems designed to support the collective good. \"Happiness is very culturally specific,\" she said. \"In Finland, there are many examples of everyday happiness that are available and accessible to everyone, whether it's nature – every person in Finland is on average about 200m from the nearest forest, park, seashore or natural body of water – saunas, public libraries, safe and efficient public transport, free clean drinking water, education or healthcare.\"\nPantzar also highlights the mood-boosting properties of contrast therapy – hot saunas followed by cold dips – as an accessible, every-day mood booster. \"It's incredibly easy to do in Helsinki, surrounded by the sea,\" she says. \"When you don't need to travel great distances or pay large fees to have a quick dip, it's easier to do more regularly, before or after work or on your lunch break.\"\nAnd while some Finns remain sceptical of the \"happiest nation\" label, most seem to appreciate what they have. \"I don't find it easy to think of Finland as the happiest country in the world,\" says pensioner Juha Roiha. \"In poorer countries like Thailand and Nepal, people seem relaxed in spite of any hardship. In Finland, you might sometimes hear people say that they'd be happier somewhere else. But within ourselves, with what we have, we're happy.\"\nHappy Land - Finding the Inner Finn, a travel memoir by Tim Bird, will be published by Eye Books in the UK in January 2026. It takes a \"sideways\" look at Finland's happiness status.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

Within moments, the trio were being chased through the streets by water gun-wielding children and smiling revellers before seeking refuge in a convenience store, bewildered and soaked to the gills.\nDespite its White Lotus portrayal, these water fights are generally a friendly and joyous part of the festivities that visitors are welcome to take part in. In fact,hordes of travellersnow descend on Thailand each year to take part in what is commonly called \"the world's biggest water fight\". Yet, the festival's modern popularity among international travellers belies Songkran's deep roots.\nMeaning \"to enter\" or \"move forward\" in Sanskrit, Songkran occurs when the Sun moves to the Aries constellation – the first sign of the Zodiac. Some scholars believe theUnesco-inscribedfestivalharks back to an ancient Hindu festivalcalled Makar Sankranti and was adopted by the Khmer Empire that ruled Thailand in the 11th Century. Today, Songkran is all about making a fresh start, with water symbolising the washing away of the previous year and purification.\nDuring the three-day festival, scented water is often poured atop images of the Buddha to represent renewal. It is also common for Thais to wash the hands of their elders and ask for their blessings, splash water on family and friends and give offerings to temples. \"Since most Thai people practice Buddhism, Songkran is also a spiritual time,\" explained Kharitthakorn Sakulsupapong, sales and marketing managerof the Thailand-basedTropical Vacationtravel agency.\nDespite being a three-day national holiday, some Thai communities – such as the popular beach resort town ofPattaya– extend the party for as many as 10 days.\nBecause April is often Thailand's hottest month, cooling foods are typically on the menu during Songkran. \"Since April is the peak of mango season, you'll find plenty of mango sticky rice, one of Thailand's most beloved desserts,\" Angkhasirisap told the BBC. \"Another seasonal favourite iskhao chae, a refreshing dish of rice soaked in jasmine-scented iced water, served with savoury side dishes – perfect for cooling down in the summer heat.\"\nVisitors who find themselves in the country during Songkran are more than welcome to join in on the festivities. \"Thai people are always very happy to teach tourists about their cultural traditions and will be delighted to answer any questions visitors may have [about the festival],\" said Jurairat Mongkolwongsiri, vice president of sales atCentara Hotels & Resortsin Bangkok. As with any religious festival, Mongkolwongsiri noted that it's also important to be respectful.\n\"Songkran is very inclusive – the water splashing is open to everyone, although it's always important to understand and respect the cultural boundaries,\" Mongkolwongsiri cautioned. \"For example, visitors must avoid throwing water on monks or elders and try not to spray water directly in anyone’s face.\"\nWhile Thailand's cities attract the biggest Songkran crowds, Angkhasirisap says travellers venturing away from the nation's main tourist hotspots are also likely to encounter the festival.\n\"Bangkok and Chiang Mai are well-known hotspots, attracting huge crowds and hosting grand celebrations,\" she explained. \"[However], in recent years, Thailand has made an effort to promote celebrations in all regions, [including] lesser-known provinces.\"\nMore like this:\n•A White Lotus actor's guide to Thailand\n•Koh Mak: The tiny island that's redefining travel to Thailand\n•Measuring the 'White Lotus effect': How TV and film locations impact travel\nAccording to Angkhasirisap, smaller destinations have their own special twist to the holiday, with beach destinations likeSongkhlaandSurat Thani, being much more laidback than the party vibes found in larger cities, while provinces likePhrae,Lamphun, andUbon Ratchathaniincorporate cultural parades into the traditional festivities.\n\"Wherever you go, you’ll find a warm and welcoming atmosphere,\" said Angkhasirisap. \"It's a truly unforgettable festival!\"\nIf you liked this story,\nsign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on"

    "content": "Iceland is one of the few places in the world where happiness is rising. Locals say the secret lies in nature, gender equality and a deep-rooted sense of resilience.\nFor the third year in a row, Finland has topped the2025 World Happiness Report. While the Nordic countries traditionally fare well in the rankings, Denmark (ranked second), Sweden (fourth), and Norway (seventh) have all reported a net lower total happiness score since the survey started, measuring a slight decline in happiness over time. In fact, out of the top 20, only seven countries have been getting happier year on year – and Iceland stands out as having one of the biggest increases of them all, seeing a 9.1% boost since its measure on the first index in 2008.\nRanked the third-happiest country in the world this year (compared to 18th in 2008), Iceland scores the highest out of all countries in social support, with impressive scores in the freedom and generosity measures as well (third and fifth respectively). Despite its relatively small population – numbering just under 400,000 – the country continues to invest in infrastructure, progressive social policies and tourism.\nBut the thing that makes many Icelanders the happiest is something that the government has relatively little control over: the nation's otherworldly landscapes.\n\"From home, from work, it's very easy to get to a national park or open spaces where we can hike, walk by the river, coast or lakes,\" says Hrund Gunnsteinsdóttir, author of forthcoming bookInnSæi: Heal, Revive and Reset with the Icelandic Art of Intuition. She especially loves the landscape's variations and stark contrasts, from green and lush to barren and black sands.\nAs a geologist originally from the US, Jessica Poteet moved to Iceland specifically to be closer to nature. \"Being somewhere with volcanoes and Northern Lights and cotton candy-pink skies with snow-capped mountains in winter is a dream,\" she says. \"I never take it for granted. It's one of the key things contributing to my happiness.\"\nThat said, residents note that winters can be long and dark, which can be a challenge – but that the summer's midnight Sun more than makes up for it. Poteet notes that on particularly sunny days, employers will often offer a \"Sun holiday\" so people can enjoy a day of hiking or skiing, depending on the season.\nThe country's strong social safety net also lends residents a sense of stability and ease. \"During Covid, I lost my job. I was able to go on unemployment until I found a new job,\" says Brenna Elizabeth Scheving, another US expat living in Iceland. She also was able to take advantage of the country's generous parental leave policy, where both parents areentitled to share 12 months parental leave, up to six months each, with six weeks transferrable to the other parent. The policy applies to both adoptive and biological parents, regardless of marital status or sexuality.\nKindergarten is alsoavailable to children as young as two, which enables parents to work and generate income, knowing that childcare and education are provided for.\nIn fact, equitable gender policies have been built into the country's DNA for decades, with the world's smallest gender gap for 15 years running, according to the2024 World Economic Forum. This no doubt leads to a sense of happiness as well, say residents.\n\"The government is run by women,\" says Gunnsteinsdóttir, noting that Iceland had theworld's first democratically elected female presidentin 1980. \"I was six years old when she was elected a president, and I didn't necessarily conceive of a man being a president.\"\nThose gender equality gains were hard fought. This year marks the 50th anniversary of theWomen's Day Off, when Icelandic women went on strike for a day to underscore the lack of equal representation in politics and the labour force. \"I'm truly grateful to these women and the men who supported them,\" says Gunnsteinsdóttir. \"Where you have gender equality, the social, economic and political aspects tend to be more stable and better for people and the natural surroundings. In countries with greater gender equality, people are healthier, happier and have better wellbeing.\"\nThat's not to say Iceland hasn't had its own share of growing pains in recent years. Costs, particularly in the capital city of Reykjavík, have grown particularly high. \"The cost of living is steep, especially housing, which can be a struggle for both locals and expats,\" said Kevin Mercier, a French photographer who has lived in Iceland the past six years and chronicles his travels atKevmrc Travel.\nThe high cost of short-term rentals has been partially blamed for this rise in housing expense, and tourism in general has put some pressures on the small island. The nation has been transformed by tourism over the past decade, welcoming around2.3 million international visitorsin 2024 – nearly double the2015 numbers) and around six times the number of residents. That said, the benefits of tourism have outweighed the costs, say many residents, and as visitor numbers continue to grow, the country is adoptingnew initiativesto manage the impact and protect its natural resources.\n\"The movement around making tourism more responsible has been very grassroots and run byIceland Tourismin collaboration with local and central authorities and private companies,\" says Gunnsteinsdóttir.\nIceland's infrastructure has also seen a boost from tourism. \"FinishingThe Ring Road[the looped highway around Iceland that was fully paved in 2019] was great for everyone, making sometimes isolated communities now easily accessible,\" said Poteet. \"Also, the amount of tourists to theFagradalsfjall volcanomeant the government built trails in the area almost immediately. So impressive!\"\nAccommodations are pushing to educate visitors about sustainability and the Icelandic way of life. Family-owned propertyHotel Rangaon the south coast offers a \"Live Like an Icelander\" programme, where a local guide takes guests through ancient farmsteads and lets them drink from a well that is said to promote longevity.ION Hotels, owned by female entrepreneur Sigurlaug Sverrisdóttir, has committed to having a female-majority staff across its two properties, ION City Hotel in Reykjavík and the ION Adventure Hotel on Lake Thingvellir, the largest lake in Iceland.\nMore like this:\n•A First Lady's guide to Iceland\n•The European region where young people are happiest\n•What makes Vanuatu one of the happiest places in the world?\nThe number of restaurants, bars and cafes has also grown to meet tourist demand, leading to more vibrant urban centres. \"When I was growing up, you would walk the streets in Reykjavík and there was hardly anyone walking around in most of the year,\" said Gunnsteinsdóttir. \"I personally quite like having people around.\"\nRegardless of the external factors, it may be an internal sense of adaptability and resilience that leads to Icelanders' ultimate happiness. Gunnsteinsdóttir points to the ancient Icelandic word for intuition,innsæi,which translates to the \"the sea within\".\n\"It's the world beyond words – of vision, feelings, imagination and things that brew before they come to the surface of our attention,\" she explains. \"It also means 'to see from the inside out', which refers to having a strong inner compass that enables us to navigate the ocean of life and the world we live in.\"\nGunnsteinsdóttir theorises that this sense of direction comes directly from living alongside an often-unpredictable natural environment and fast-changing weather conditions. \"In recent years, we've had multiple eruptions and earthquakes. When you constantly feel the earth is shaking, it really reminds you that things can change quite rapidly,\" she says. \"When it comes to happiness, it encourages us to make the best out of what we have when things don't go according to plan.\"\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "summary": "Recent changes by the Trump administration are affecting how US museums and institutions tell the nation's multicultural history to travellers.",
    "content": "Recent changes by the Trump administration are affecting how US museums and institutions tell the nation's multicultural history to travellers.\nIn the last few months, US President Donald Trump has threatened toannex Canada; warned that the US will \"go as far as we have to go\" to seize Greenland; andimposed tariffs on all nations, effectively initiating aglobal trade war. But while many of Trump's most dramatic \"America first\" actions are aimed at other countries, his sweeping new policy changes are also affecting how the US tells its own multicultural story.\nSeveral highly touristed landmarks in the US are already facing significant changes.\nOn 27 March, Trump signed an executive order titledRestoring Truth and Sanity to American History, arguing that there has been \"a concerted and widespread effort to rewrite our Nation's history, replacing objective facts with a distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth\". The order took specific aim at theSmithsonian Institution, whose 21 museums, 21 libraries and many other research and cultural centres comprisethe world's largest museum complexand were visited bynearly 17 million people in 2024.\n\"Once widely respected as a symbol of American excellence and a global icon of cultural achievement,\" the order states, \"the Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of divisive, race-centred ideology.\"\nThe order threatens to bar congressional funds from institutions that espouse \"improper, divisive or anti-American\" beliefs. As an example of this, Trump cited programming from the Smithsonian'sNational Museum of African American History & Culture, the only national museum devoted exclusively to documenting African American life, history and culture from slavery to the modern era.\nHeadquartered on the National Mall in Washington DC, some of the Smithsonian's many museums focus on marginalised communities in the US – including theNational Museum of the American Indian,theNational Museum of African Art, theNational Museum of the American Latinoand the embattled National Museum of African American History and Culture.\nMany activists and historians have expressed outrage over the order's broader meaning and argued that it is actually a brazen attempt to do what Trump is denouncing:rewrite US history. This begs the question, which version of the US will visitors find?\n\"It seems like we're headed in the direction where there's even an attempt to deny that the institution of slavery even existed, or thatJim Crow lawsand segregation and racial violence against Black communities, Black families, Black individuals even occurred,\" said Dr Clarissa Myrick-Harris White, a historian and Africana studies professor at the historically Black Morehouse College in a statement to theAssociated Press.\nThis concern was echoed by theAmerican Historical Association, whose 10,000 members represent the world's largest organisation of professional historians. In astatementco-signed by 31 organisations, the association says the executive order \"egregiously misrepresents the work of the Smithsonian Institution\", which was established by Congress more than 175 years ago for the \"increase and diffusion of knowledge\".\n\"The stories that have shaped our past include not only elements that make us proud but also aspects that make us acutely aware of tragedies in our nation's history,\" the statement notes. \"No person, no nation, is perfect, and we should all – as individuals and as nations – learn from our imperfections.\"\nSome feel Trump's targeting of the Smithsonian is part of a broader culture war he has been waging against \"woke ideology\" across many of the nation's federally run institutions. Since returning to office, Trump hasworked to dismantlethe Institute of Museum and Library Sciences, which oversawgrant fundingfor numerous Native American, Native Hawaiian, Latinx and African American museums across the country; and Trump's agencies have reportedly issued alist of wordsto limit or disappear from government websites, like \"women\", \"Black\" and \"cultural heritage\".\nSome of these references have already been removed from websites or displays of traveller-friendly landmarks. In February,Stonewall National Monumentin New York City, which is run by the US National Park Service,erased references to transgender people. In March, Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia – which is managed by the US Department of the Army –scrubbed its websiteof any information highlighting the contributions of African American, Hispanic or female servicemembers, including removing stories about veteran and civil rights leaderMedgar Eversand theTuskegee Airmen, the US's first Black Airforce pilots. In nearby Washington DC, a two-block section of 16th Street leading to the White House with the words \"Black Lives Matter\"was recently repavedin response to threats to cut transportation funding if the plaza was not renamed.\n\"If you take a broad brush and say we've spent too much time talking about folks other than old white [men], then you have wiped out a lot of whatactuallymakes America great,\" said Greg Werkheiser, founding partner ofCultural Heritage Partners, a law firm that specialises in protecting cultural heritage sites. \"A lot of places around the world have had similar challenges and have not overcome them. We have. And those lessons are not lessons of self-loathing and tragedy, they're lessons about how we keep pushing towards a more perfect union.\"\nSince the Black Lives Matter protests five years ago, many museums and other cultural institutions have sought to include more diverse perspectives in their exhibitions, a move that oftenboosted their visitor numbers. But as Werkheiser explained, the Trump administration's unprecedented exertion of influence on cultural institutions is especially problematic for those that specialise in telling stories from Black, Asian, Latinx and LGBTQ+ perspectives, since many of these places rely on federal funding to keep them afloat.\n\"That baseline of commitment [from the government] is essential to ensure that the ebbs and flows of private donors don't take out institutions. When we take that away, we make these institutions very unstable.\"\nVisitors to the US may now find that even larger museums and organisations have been forced to make sweeping changes to their programming in light of the new policies. The DC-basedArt Museum of the Americascancelled two planned exhibitionshighlighting the work of Black and LGBTQ+ artists in March, reportedly in response to the administration's new diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies. Meanwhile, theUnited States Marine Band, the country's oldest continually active musical association,recently cancelled a concertthat was supposed to feature young musicians of colour. Perhaps most famously, in February Trumpseized controlof theKennedy Centerin Washington DC, one of the US's premier arts institutions. Since Trump's takeover, a host ofacts have cancelledtheir planned appearances in protest.\n\"If it didn't matter, they wouldn't try to stop us,\" said Ashley Rogers, executive director of theWhitney Plantation, the only plantation museum in Louisiana focussing exclusively on the experience of the people who were forcibly enslaved there. \"These stories that we've been telling, they explain us to ourselves. You cannot understand the United States today without understanding our history with regard to race, slavery, relationships with Indigenous people and the genocides – all of these things that are 'bad'. We have to understand them, because they explain who we are today.\"\nThe Whitney and other nearby locations, including a centuries-old sugar-cane plantation that once housed Africans and Creole people recentlylost a bidto be designated as a National Historic Landmark District, a process that had been in the works for several years. The designation would have protected the Whitney and other historical sites from outside development, a necessary move as many in the local area had long wanted to clear the path for more industrial development, according to Rogers. She added that local government officials requested to have the application pulled from consideration once the Trump administration got in office.\nBoth Rogers and Werkheiser expressed concern that the budget cuts Trump is imposing on cultural institutions might have long-term repercussions. They stressed that even if funding cuts and DEI restrictions are ultimately overturned in court, they may still trigger a long-lasting drop in the financial stability of smaller institutions – especially those that seek to tell stories from diverse perspectives, which may not attract as many visitors as larger, more \"mainstream\" museums. Historians, scholars, artists and others employed by cultural institutions who carry this specialised knowledge are also at risk.\n\"These artefacts and the sites that represent our shared history, are vulnerable to destruction and to permanent loss, but I'm also worried that the people who preserve those histories are also irreplaceable,\" said Werkheiser. \"I'm very concerned about the scholars and government employees who have devoted their careers to preserving our country's cultural heritage. Many have lost their jobs or worried that they might soon be out of work, and we know that their knowledge and expertise are vital.\"\nMore like this:\n•The Alabama museum grappling with the 'Gulf of America'\n•How Trump's sweeping new policies could change travel\n•'A hostile state': Why some travellers are avoiding the US\nRogers and Werkheiser stressed the importance of institutions and individuals pushing back against these policies as much as possible. They also highlighted the role of visitors in helping to support cultural institutions that tell stories from diverse perspectives, particularly in difficult times.\n\"What's happening at [the] Whitney, the way that this administration's policies are affecting us, that is happening in everyone's local community,\" said Rogers. \"There is going to be a local museum, a local library [near you] who is really struggling, and they need our support more than ever right now.\"\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nFor more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us onFacebook,XandInstagram."

    "content": "From romantic retreats in the Mediterranean to fresh-air-filled Alpine hikes, these are the most exciting areas of Europe to visit this year.\nWhile much of Europe is ripe with history, culture, cuisine and breathtaking landscapes, some spots are particularly primed to welcome visitors right now.\nThis is not your typical all-time European getaway list; you won't findRomeor London here. Paris made the cut because of its post-Olympics peacefulness (plus the reopening of Notre Dame, an icon that has finallyfound its voice). Instead of a lifetime bucket list, we've curated 2025-specific picks that will make this year's holidays particularly memorable. Many of these are unsung destinations free from the overcrowding that's causedtourism upheaval– and rows with locals – in highly touristed European cities for the last several years.\nThese are on-the-rise areas of Europe where you can experience iconic cultural sites, spectacular hotels and outdoor adventures. From spending days on the sun-soaked Mediterranean coast to climbing the highest Alpine peaks, here are nine exciting European destinations to visit in 2025.\nPugliasaw a 20% jump in international arrivals in 2024 with more than 15 million overnight stays – still a fraction of Rome's 51 million. With two international airports (Bari and Brindisi) and rising interest, now is the time to visit before word gets out much further.\n\"The heel of Italy's boot offers incredible value compared to the Amalfi Coast with authenticmasserie(farmhouse hotels) being converted into luxury properties,\" says California-based travel advisor and photographerCoco Tran, who has been researching and photographing Italy for years. \"The region's celebration of slow food, incredible coastline and Unesco sites likeAlberobellomake it exceptional,\" she adds. In 2025, travellers can also experience theJubilee Puglia, a Catholic event that only takes place every 25 years, aligning with larger events inRome.\nTran recommends booking a table at cliff-sideOsteria Sant'Annain Polignano a Mare where the morning's catch is served fresh. On warm days, take a dip at Grotta della Poesia (Poetry Cave), a picture-perfect natural swimming hole; or saunter throughLecce's Baroque-filled streets. And while it's a new year, some old favourites remain the same. Tran saysMasseria Torre Coccaroremains the spot to stay, with white-washed rooms surrounded by ancient olive groves – plus villas with private plunge pools so you can soak it all in without another guest in sight.\nBest time to visit:Puglia's shoulder seasons, in late spring (May-June) and early autumn (September-October), offer ideal weather and fewer crowds.\nPortugal continues to attract global attention, but there's far more to this Iberian nation thanPortoandLisbon. One region finally stepping into the spotlight is theAlentejo coast, which experienced itsbest tourism yearon record in 2024.\n\"Portugal's Alentejo coast is finally getting deserved attention, with its pristine beaches and fantastic wineries,\" says Tran. While many travellers tack the region onto a trip to Lisbon or the Algarve, this breathtaking section of coast is worth a dedicated journey – especially for those seeking nature, history and adventure.\nThe area's \"mix of coastal beauty, incredible cycling routes and overall affordability compared to many other places in Europe\" make it an ideal getaway for thrill-seekers, says Maria Elena Price ofExperiencePlus! Bicycle Tours, which hosts tours around the world, including the Alentejo Coast.\nÉvora, a Unesco-listed city with Roman ruins and medieval architecture, is ideal for history buffs; while Zambujeira do Mar offers one of the nation's most beautiful beaches. Throughout June, travellers can also take part in the famedFestas dos Santos Populares(Popular Saints' Festivals), a nationwide celebration of Portugal's patron saints. Base yourself atCraveiral, a boutique stay where more than 70% of the restaurant's ingredients come from its on-site farm – including the toppings on its wood-fired pizzas.\nBest time to visit:Summer is a blast in the Alentejo, with busy beaches and hiking through theFisherman's Trail. If you prefer thinner crowds, you'll still find spectacular weather in the autumn, between September and November.\nAbout five million people visit Chamonix a year, while a million others visit Verbier – both rightly famous for their epic snowfalls and fantastic on- and off-piste terrain. However, it's high time global travellers explored the less-touristed European peaks – specifically,Andermatt-Sedrun-Disentis, three interconnected resorts that together offer 180km of skiable terrain. And while the skiing is already supreme, Mike Goar, who is the COO of mountain operations in Switzerland for Vail Resorts, says 2025 will see the investment of 110m Swiss francs (£89.5m) into mountain improvements such as snowmaking, meaning it's only going to get better.\nHowever, this destination is not just for winter. In any season, you can ride theGlacier Expresstrain through the Alpine region, take a day hike to the glacial Lago di Tom or visit the nearby Uri Alps for a multi-day cycling trip. This region offers that small Alpine village feel – including a seemingly endless supply of fondue – and fewer crowds than its better-known Swiss counterparts. Stay at the luxuriousChedi Andermatt, which offers easy access to the slopes; and look out for thePost Hotel & residences by Elie Saab, a fashion-forward hotel expected to open next ski season.\nBest time to visit:Andermatt-Sedrun-Disentis is a true all-season destination. You can ski from December through April, hike and bike from June through September and enjoy spring flowers and autumn foliage in between.\nCap d'Antibes is having a cultural moment in 2025, making this glamourous corner of the French Riviera worth another look. This year marks the 100th anniversary of F Scott Fitzgerald's arrival on the Côted'Azur – an event that helped shape the Riviera's Jazz Age legacy – and the literary milestone is drawing renewed attention to the region's artistic significance.\nThe iconicBelles Riveshotel –Fitzgerald's homefor part of the 1920s – is embracing its storied past with a series of celebratory events. \"The centennial anniversary of Fitzgerald's arrival makes this legendary hotel more relevant than ever,\" says Andria Mitsakos, founder ofAMPR, which represents the property.\nBeyond the hotel, Cap d'Antibes hosts theJuan-les-Pins International Jazz Festivalin July, whenBastille Daycelebrations bring fireworks and festivities to the beaches. Later in the year, visitors can attend theFestival International d'Art Sacré, one of the region's oldest music festivals. Bonus: you'll be right in the heart of everything the French Riviera has to offer, from golden beaches and dramatic cliffs to cultural sites such as thePicasso Museumand theChapelle Matisse.\nBest time to visit:The summer sun beckons A-listers, making it a great time to come for a bit of celebrity-spotting and warm waters for dipping. For cooler temps and fewer crowds, stick to April-June and September-October.\nWhile Italy continues tograpple with overtourism, nearby Slovenia is quietly emerging as a smart alternative, offering spectacular scenery,cultural depthand fewer crowds. With Nova Gorica named aEuropean Capital of Culture for 2025, the timing couldn't be better to explore this captivating nation.\nAt just under 20,720sq km, Slovenia is a \"small but mighty country\", says James Montie, branch manager atFox World Travel, who's seen growing demand from clients looking for off-the-beaten-path destinations. Slovenia's breathtaking landscapes, \"fromLake Bled's fairytale setting to the underground wonders of Postojna Cave\", are a primary draw, he adds.\nMore like this:\n•The 25 best places to travel in 2025\n•Eight of the world's most extraordinary tiny hotel rooms\n•Here's how to safely visit glacier sites around the world\nIndependent travel advisorKimberly Denisonagrees that Slovenia is poised for a tourism boom and that now is the time to pre-empt the crowds \"Slovenia is a leader in wellness and sustainability, with green-certified cities, boutique eco-lodges and luxurious wellness retreats,\" she says. It also has bonafide stats to back up its green messaging, including that60% of the country's surface area is forestand it was certified asthe world's first green destinationin 2016.\nTo explore its glorious landscapes, hikeTriglav National Park, home to Slovenia's highest peak, before overnighting atVila Bled, a historic lakeside retreat that looks like it should be a summer house for royals.\nBest time to visit:The warmer months between May through September offer the greatest opportunities to enjoy outdoor adventures.\nThe Greek Islands are a perennial favourite, but in 2025, it's the mainland that's set to shine – specifically the outstretched fingers of the Peloponnese. Greece is investing heavily in the region this year, upgrading infrastructure like the Mycenae road network and directing funding towards sustainable agritourism and local olive producers. The result for travellers is easier access, deeper cultural connection and fewer crowds.\nOf the Peloponnese's three peninsulas,Mani– the rugged middle finger – stands out. \"Far from the Cycladic island buzz, Mani isGreece's best-kept secret,\" says Mitsakos, who lives in Greece and represents a boutique hotel in Mani. \"This rugged, sun-scorched region is a treasure find for travellers seeking authenticity, serenity and deep cultural resonance.\" Expect cobblestoned villages, pristine beaches and hidden coves, along with \"a deep-rooted history\", she adds. Stay atPirgos Mavromichali, a restored 18th-Century tower turned boutique hotel where whitewashed rooms overlook the bay's turquoise waters.\nElsewhere in the region, travellers can visit Olympia, thebirthplace of the Olympics; or relax on Voidokilia Beach on the west coast. Mitsakos also recommends traditional villages like Milea, Rigklia and Exoxhori for their vibrant folk feasts that are reviving local traditions.\nBest time to visit:Greece is packed in the summer, but thanks to the mainland's slightly warmer temperatures, you can get away with a warm-weather break with fewer crowds from April to June and September to October.\nParishad quite the2024 hosting the Summer Olympics, which means the crowds have thinned and prices dipped back down for 2025. Plus, travel here is now easier than ever;since 1 January 2025, the Paris metro system no longer relies on a complicated zone system with extra fares for thebanlieues(suburbs). Today, you can use a single ticket to travel the entire network for up to two hours.\nWhat parts of this renowned city should you prioritise? Paul Holinaty, who specialises in Central and Northern European travel atGoway, says you should hit up the neighbourhoods on the Left Bank of the Seine in particular. \"Saint Germain des Pres and Luxembourg gardens are close enough to the main sites,\" he explains, \"but nicely tucked away, where you can still find really authentic bakeries, local shops and amazing cafe culture – there's a lot of locals buzzing around the area too.\" The Rive Gauche is also home to plenty of book shops, theatres and elegant boutiques, making the whole area something out of a romantic film. Travellers can also rediscover an old favourite, thanks toNotre Damereopening its doors at the end of 2024. As for where to stay, the classicHôtel du Savoir, formerly called the Hôtel Petit Belloy, just reopened post-reno (done by Laune Architecture) in Saint-Germain-des-Prés and is, let's just say,trés chic.\nBest time to visit:Paris is a feast for the senses in all seasons. That said, it's particularly lovely in spring, from April to June, with flowers blooming and longer, sunnier days.\nTourism to Sweden hassurged in recent years, driven in part by the rise of the \"coolcation\" trend where travellers seek out more temperate destinations for their summer getaways. With pristine landscapes, clean air and progressive values, the Nordic nation fits the brief perfectly. Even in the height of summer, temperatures rarely break 20C, making it a compelling alternative to the heat of southern Europe.\nWhile many first-timers gravitate to Stockholm, the west coast remains a wilder, more rugged alternative; think graniteislands, salty air and seafood straight off the boat. The long summer days and crisp nights create ideal conditions for kayaking, hiking or just soaking up the Nordic light – minus the crowds and queues of the capital.\nIt's also a fantastic place for sustainability-minded travellers, withGothenburg, Sweden's second-largest city, recently awarded theEU's Mission Labelfor its ambitious plans to become climate-neutral by 2030. Check in atHotel Pigalle, a boutique hotel with vintage flair and eco-conscious touches, including bio-cleaning products and locally sourced ingredients. If you're seeking more solitude than the city can offer, theBohuslän archipelagobeckons with low-impact adventures, island-hopping and some of the best shellfish you'll ever taste.\nBest time to visit:June-August brings long daylight hours, with sunsets at 22:00 and the best weather for coastal adventures.\nAlbania has long been one of Europe's most underrated destinations, but that's changing fast. Thanks to relaxed visa requirements and expanded international flight routes, the country is quickly rising on the travel radar. In 2024, Albania welcomed a record11.7 million international visitors, a surge driven in part by the global rise in interest inlesser-known Mediterranean escapes– which means that now is prime time to see this beautiful country before it books up.\n\"Albania is quickly gaining recognition for its mix of history, unspoiled coastline and emerging food and wine scene,\" says Denison. \"The Unesco-listed town ofGjirokastër, the pristine beaches of the Albanian Riviera and the vineyards of Berat create a Mediterranean escape that is still under the radar but rapidly gaining momentum.\"\nNew infrastructure projects are smoothing the journey (fewer potholes are always a plus). Albania is also investing in luxury accommodations, including theGreen Coast Hotelnear theUnesco World Heritage site of Butrint, which is set to provide unparalleled luxury nestled among the sea caves. \"Albania is poised to become a major player in luxury travel,\" Denison adds.\nWhile hotpots like Ksamil are growing in popularity, travellers who venture just a little beyond the crowds are rewarded with clear turquoise waters that rival the Greek Islands. Inland, theAccursed Mountains' dramatic landscapes draw hikers and adventure seekers to the country's rugged north. Stylish coastal stays likeLa Brisa Boutique Hotelin Dhermi place you just steps from the sand; while major developments like the newMarriott in the Vlora Marina(expected to open in 2028) signal that this Mediterranean up-and-comer won't stay quiet for long.\nBest time to visit:The summer months are prime time in Albania – and not yet experiencing the crowds of neighbours like Greece. The warm weather makes for ideal beach, hiking and exploring conditions.\nWant to explore even further?

    "content": "Constructed by a mysterious civilisation that left no written records, the massive site is now open to the public for the first time in more than a century.\nAutumn leaves crackled under our shoes as dozens of eager tourists and I followed a guide along a grassy mound. We stopped when we reached the opening of a turf-topped circle, which was formed by another wall of mounded earth. We were atThe Octagon, part of theHopewell Ceremonial Earthworks, a large network of hand-constructed hills spread throughout central and southern Ohio that were built as many as 2,000 years ago. Indigenous people would come to The Octagon from hundreds of miles away, gathering regularly for shared rituals and worship.\n\"There was a sweat lodge or some kind of purification place there,\" said our guide, Brad Lepper, senior archaeologist for theOhio History Connection's World Heritage Program(OHC), as he pointed to the circle. I looked inside to see a perfectly manicured lawn – a putting green. A tall flag marked a hole at its centre.\nThat's because from 1910 through 2024, The Octagon had been used as a golf course. But on 1 January 2025, this ancient, enigmatic sitereopened to visitorsfor the first time in more than a century.\nAll these prehistoric ceremonial earthworks in Ohio were created by what is now called theHopewell Culture, a network of Native American societies that gathered from as far away as Montana and theGulf of Mexicobetween roughly 100 BCE and 500 CE and were connected by a series of trade routes. Their earthworks in Ohio consist of shapes – like circles, squares and octagons – that were often connected to each other. Archaeologists are only now beginning to understand the sophistication of these engineering marvels.\nBuilt with astonishing mathematical precision, as well as a complex astronomical alignment, these are the largest geometrical earthworks in the world that were not built as fortifications or defensive structures. And while most people have never heard about the sites or its builders, that may be about to change.\nIn 2023, eight of Hopewell's earthworks were inscribed as aUnesco World Heritage site. These includeThe Great Circleand The Octagon in Newark, Ohio, as well Ohio's first state park,Fort Ancient(not an actual fort). The other five are part of theHopewell Culture National Historical Park: Mound City, Hopeton Earthworks, High Bank Works, Hopewell Mound Group and Seip Earthworks.\nLepper told me The Octagon and The Great Circle were once a larger, single Hopewell complex spanning 4.5 square miles and connected by a series of roads lined by earthwork walls. Walking through both sites today, there is an immediate shock of scale. The Great Circle, wherethe museumfor Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks is found, is 1,200ft in diameter. Its walls rise up to14ft highand are outlined on the inside by a deep ditch. The Great Circle was once connected to a square and a burial ellipse, with only part of the square still visible today. The Octagon sprawls a massive 50 acres and is attached to the 20-acre Observatory Circle, a large earthwork circle for gathering and rituals connected to the observation of the night sky.\n\"You could put four Roman Colosseums inside just The Octagon,\" Lepper told me. \"Stonehenge would fit within just that small circle now serving as a putting green.\" He added that 2,000 years ago, Indigenous workers built these earthworks without modern tools, digging up soil with pointed sticks and hauling it in wicker baskets on their backs. One estimate, he noted, is that they moved seven million cubic feet of dirt.\nThe achievement of the Hopewell Culture, however, is not simply in creating large, precise shapes, which they did without the vantage point of hills for an aerial view. They also embedded a sort of hidden geometry within these structures. Until the mounds were measured and compared, it was thought that the builders didn't have any mathematical and geometrical sophistication, as there are no written records to testify to their level of knowledge. It was eventually discovered, however, that they made precise measurements across their earthworks and connected them in unsuspecting ways.\nLepper explained that the circumference of The Great Circle \"is equal to the perimeter of the perfect square that it was connected to\", and that \"the area of that perfect square is equal to the area of the [Observatory Circle] that's connected to The Octagon\".\nHe added: \"If you draw a square inside The Octagon by drawing a line from alternate corners of The Octagon, the sides of that square [1,054ft] are equal to the diameter of the circle that it's attached to [1,054ft].\"\nExamples of this interplay between earthworks have been found repeatedly by archaeologists. According to Lepper, that measure of 1054ft, whether halved or doubled, is found in other Indigenous earthworks across the country, and served as a common unit of measure.\nWhile the Hopewell Culture's geometrical and mathematical knowledge astonished scholars, another level of sophistication appears when the layers are peeled back further: astronomical alignment.\nMore like this\n•The US's lost, ancient megacity\n•A mysterious US desert civilisation\n•A long-lost Maya city that was just discovered\nIn the 1980s, two professors at Earlham College in Indiana, Ray Hively (a physicist and astronomer) and Robert Horn (a philosopher), decided to pay a visit to The Octagon and its attached Observatory Circle. As astronomical monuments like Stonehenge had received great attention, they wondered if these earthworks were also aligned to a solar calendar.\nHively and Horn found no solar connections, but they then considered an alternative purpose: the lunar cycle.\n\"We thought deliberate lunar alignments unlikely at Newark,\"they wrote, because while the Sun can be tracked over a year, a complete lunar cycle takes 18.6 years. Even so, the lunar cycle proved to correspond to the position of the Observatory Mound at The Observatory Circle. There, one can watch the Moon rise over the exact centre of The Octagon in the distance every 18.6 years.\n\"Astronomical alignments are only relevant and useful if they somehow tie the celestial orbs to belief systems and understandings of life,\" said Timothy Darvill, professor of archaeology at Bournemouth University who has researched both Stonehenge and the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks. \"The ceremonies around the observation of the skyscape could well have a secondary function in terms of fostering community.\"\nThat ancient community and culture was part of the reason for its Unesco World Heritage Site inclusion.\nA Unesco site needs to show that it has \"outstanding universal value\", said Jennifer Aultman, director of historic sites and museums atOhio History Connectionwhich helped lead its Unesco consideration. One criterion for this, she said, \"is that these are masterpieces of human creative genius\", which is where these mathematical, geometrical and astronomical features are important. The other, \"is that they bear really exceptional testimony to the cultural tradition that produced them\".\nAultman explained: \"You really can understand something about the lives of the people and what mattered to them by looking at, and learning about, the earthworks.\"\nConsider the Moon, for example, which was clearly important for the Hopewell Culture. Darvill told me that, for some cultures, the \"Sun, Moon... are considered to have power over what happens on a day-to-day basis. As such, the heavenly bodies are often deified, which is how their power is justified and rationalised.\" It is therefore likely that the Moon was a deity shared by those who gathered at the mounds.\n\"The land we know as Ohio is home to a number of extraordinary earthworks built by Indigenous residents of this region thousands of years ago,\" said Megan Wood, executive director and CEO of the Ohio History Connection. While not all earthworks in Ohio are specifically Hopewell Mounds – such as the solar-alignedSerpent Mound Historical Sitein Peebles, Ohio, for example – Wood sees them all as \"icons\" of Indigenous \"cultural achievements\".\nSince the Hopewell Culture left no written records, only the earthworks and the few objects retrieved from them serve as their last cultural testimony. While archaeological excavations continue on some sites, objects like ritual smoking pipes and a small stone statue of a shaman wearing a bear skin and holding a human skull called \"the Shaman of Newark\" have been found. As these earthworks were gathering places and not villages, artefacts representing the locations from where these Indigenous peoples travelled have also been discovered, likeeffigy pipes,a copper head plateand anobsidian knife.\nHowever, after the Hopewell Culture gradually began to disappear starting around 500 CE, other Indigenous peoples stepped in to become caretakers of the land. One of those groups was theShawnee Tribe, which called Ohio home before they wereforcibly removedwest of the Mississippi River in the 1830s.\n\"We may not have been responsible for building or creating them, but I know that my ancestors lived there, and that my ancestors protected them and respected them,\" said Chief Glenna Wallace of theEastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma, who believes that other tribes should have a role in the future of protecting the Hopewell Earthworks and communicating their cultural importance.\nFor years, The Octagon was under the control of theMoundbuilders Country Club. After more than a decade of negotiations, the OHC and the club finallyreached a dealin 2024 to transfer the site's long-term lease to the historical society, paving the way for them to open the earthworks to visitors beginning this January.\nFor advocates of the site's preservation, the Unesco designation and opening of these mysterious mounds to the public offers a new chapter to educate visitors about Ohio's Native American history. It also means more Indigenous stakeholders, like the Shawnee, can tell that story from an Indigenous perspective for future generations.\n\"I just want people to know about it,\" said Chief Wallace, \"I want people to be able to see it. I want people to be able to visit it and want people to realise that it is a cultural phenomenon. That it's priceless.\"\nThis story was originally published in December 2022 and has been updated to reflect recent developments.\nIf you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us onFacebook, or follow us onTwitterandInstagram."
