    "section": "news",
    "content": "The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has told the BBC that Ukraine may have to give up land as part of a peace deal with Russia, amid a growing pressure from President Donald Trump to accept territorial concessions. One of the scenarios is… to give up territory. It's not fair. But for the peace, temporary peace, maybe it can be a solution, temporary, he said in response to questions from the BBC. But the 53-year-old former boxing champion-turned politician stressed that the Ukrainian people would never accept occupation by Russia. He was speaking hours after a Russian missile-and-drone attack on Kyiv killed 12 people and injured more than 80. It was one of the deadliest Russian assaults on the Ukrainian capital in months. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory. Klitschko is now one of the most senior Ukrainian politicians to indicate publicly that his country may have to give up territory, albeit temporarily. The Kyiv mayor and Zelensky are political opponents. The mayor has repeatedly accused the president and his team of trying to undermine his authority. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme from his office in central Kyiv on Thursday, Klitschko noted that he was responsible for the capital of Ukraine, describing it as the heart of the war-torn country. He said President Volodymyr Zelensky might be forced to take a painful solution to achieve peace. When asked whether Zelensky has been discussing with him any details of a possible settlement, Klitschko replied bluntly: No. President Zelensky does [it] himself. It's not my function, he added. Referring to a very public bust-up between Zelensky and Trump at the White House in February, the mayor suggested that key issues between top politicians would be better discussed without video cameras. Earlier this week, Trump accused Zelensky of harming peace negotiations, after the Ukrainian leader again ruled out recognising Russian control of Crimea, a southern Ukrainian peninsula illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014. Trump said Crimea was lost years ago and was currently not even a point of discussion. But Zelensky pointed to a 2018 Crimea declaration by Trump's then-secretary of state Mike Pompeo saying the US rejects Russia's attempted annexation. Ukraine and its European allies have in recent weeks expressed alarm over what many on the continent see as Trump's warming of relations with Vladimir Putin's Russia. As talks ramp up, Russian strikes on Ukraine have continued. On Thursday, an attack on Kyiv killed 12 people and injured dozens, officials said. The BBC witnessed the body of a child being brought out from the wreckage of their home while people quietly cried nearby. Svitlana, a teacher at a school close by which was also hit, spoke of her hurt and added she believed Russia would not stop its aggression if Ukraine gave up Crimea. Those who think that Putin will stop if he is given Crimea, they don't know who the Russians are, he is not going to stop, she said. She said Zelensky expresses the opinion of all of us and we support him. Another woman, Olha, who had helped rescue workers carry out 10 people, five of whom were dead and the rest injured, was more critical. As of now I think it's better to be away from here because nothing good awaits us here, she said, adding there will not be a good solution for Ukraine. She said Zelensky was a comedian and he should have stayed a comedian.",

    "title": "Trump sparks row with deep-sea mining order",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2v37z333lo",
    "section": "news",
    "content": "Donald Trump has signed a controversial executive order aimed at stepping up deep-sea mining within US and in international waters. Thursday's order is the latest issued by the US president to try to increase America's access to minerals used by the aerospace, green technology and healthcare sectors. The deep sea contains billions of tonnes of potato-shaped rocks, called polymetallic nodules, which are rich in critical minerals like cobalt and rare earths. Many other countries and environmental groups oppose deep-sea mining in international waters without further research. The latest US executive orderwas issued to establish the United States as a global leader in responsible seabed mineral exploration, it reads. The move appears to bypass a long-running round of UN negotiations on mining in international waters. The US authorisation... violates international law and harms the overall interests of the international community, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said on Friday. China dominates the production of rare earths and critical metals like cobalt and lithium. Trump has beenfrustrated by this relative weakness of the US position, analysts say. We want the US to get ahead of China in this resource space under the ocean, on the ocean bottom, a US official said on Thursday. To achieve this, the order says the US will speed up the process of issuing exploration licences and recovery permits both in its own waters and in areas beyond national jurisdiction. The administration estimates that deep-sea mining could boost the country's GDP by $300bn (£225bn) over 10 years and create 100,000 jobs The EU, the UK and others support a moratorium on the practice until further scientific research is carried out. Environmentalists and scientists are concerned that undiscovered species living in the deep sea could be harmed by the process. Deep-sea mining is a deeply dangerous endeavour for our ocean, said Jeff Watters of Ocean Conservancy, a US-based environmental group. The harm caused by deep-sea mining isn't restricted to the ocean floor: it will impact the entire water column, top to bottom, and everyone and everything relying on it, he added in a statement released on Friday. It is not clear how quickly deep-sea mining could begin but one mining company, The Metals Company (TMC), is already in discussions with the US government to obtain permits. TMC's CEO Gerard Barron has previously said he hopes to begin mining by the end of the year. Along with others in the mining industry, he disputes the environmental claims made and has argued that the abyssal zone - 3,000m to 6,000m below sea level - has very low concentrations of life. Here there's zero flora. And if we measure the amount of fauna [animal life], in the form of biomass, there is around 10g per square metre. That compares with more than 30kg of biomass where the world is pushing more nickel extraction, which is our equatorial rainforests, he previously told the BBC. A recent paper published by the Natural History Museum and the National Oceanography Centre looked at the long term impacts of deep sea mining from a test carried out in the 1970s. It concludedthat some sediment-dwelling creatures were able to recolonise the site and recover from the test, but larger animals appeared not to have returned. The scientists concluded this could have been because there were no more nodules for them to live on. The polymetallic nodules where the minerals are found take millions of years to form and therefore cannot easily be replaced.",

    "section": "news",
    "content": "China will let scientists from six countries, including the US, examine the rocks it collected from the Moon - a scientific collaboration that comes as the two countries remain locked in a bitter trade war. Two Nasa-funded US institutions have been granted access to the lunar samples collected by the Chang'e-5 mission in 2020, the China National Space Administration (CNSA) said on Thursday. CNSA chief Shan Zhongde said that the samples were a shared treasure for all humanity, local media reported. Chinese researchers have not been able to access Nasa's Moon samples because of restrictions imposed by US lawmakers on the space agency's collaboration with China. Under the 2011 law, Nasa is banned from collaboration with China or any Chinese-owned companies unless it is specifically authorised by Congress. But John Logsdon, the former director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, told BBC Newshour that the latest exchange of Moon rocks have very little to do with politics. While there are controls on space technology, the examination of lunar samples had nothing of military significance, he said. It's international cooperation in science which is the norm. Washington has imposed tariffs Chinese goods that go up to 245%, while Beijing has hit back with 125% tariffs on US goods. US President Donald Trump previously hinted at a de-escalation in the trade war, but Beijing has denied that there were negotiations between the two sides. In 2023, the CNSA put out a call for applications to study its Chang'e-5 moon samples. What's special about the Chang'e-5 Moon samples is that they seem to be a billion years younger than those collected from Apollo missions, Dr Logsdon said. So it suggests that volcanic activity went on in the moon more recently than people had thought. Space officials from the US and China had reportedly tried to negotiate an exchange of moon samples last year - but it appears the deal did not materialise. Besides Brown University and Stony Brook University in the US, the other winning bids came from institutions in France, Germany, Japan, Pakistan, the UK. Shan, from the CNSA, said the agency will maintain an increasingly active and open stance in international space exchange and cooperation, including along the space information corridor under the Belt and Road Initiative I believe China's circle of friends in space will continue to grow, he said.",

    "title": "California passes Japan as fourth largest economy",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly80zlk1lyo",
    "section": "news",
    "content": "California's economy has overtaken that of the country of Japan, making the US state the fourth largest global economic force. Governor Gavin Newsom touted new data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the US Bureau of Economic Analysis showing California's growth. The data shows California's gross domestic product (GDP) hit $4.10 trillion (£3.08 trillion) in 2024, surpassing Japan, which was marked at $4.01 trillion. The state now only trails Germany, China and the US as a whole. California isn't just keeping pace with the world - we're setting the pace, Newsom said. The new figures come as Newsom has spoken out against President Donald Trump's tariffs and voiced concern about the future of the state's economy. California has the largest share of manufacturing and agricultural production in the US. It is also home to leading technological innovation, the centre of the world's entertainment industry and the country's two largest seaports. Newsom, a prominent Democrat and possible presidential candidate in 2028,filed a lawsuitchallenging Trump's authority to impose the levies, which have caused disruption to global markets and trade. Trump has enacted 10% levies on almost all countries importing to the US, after announcing a 90-day pause on higher tariffs. Another 25% tariff was imposed on Mexico and Canada. The levies on China, however, have led to an all-out trade war with the world's second largest economy. Trump imposed import taxes of up to 145% on Chinese goods coming into the US and China hit back with a 125% tax on American products. His administration said last week that when the new tariffs were added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%. Newsom noted his worries about the future of the state's economy. While we celebrate this success, we recognise that our progress is threatened by the reckless tariff policies of the current federal administration, he said. California's economy powers the nation, and it must be protected. Trump has argued his trade war is only levelling the playing field after years of the US being taken advantage of. The tariffs are an effort to encourage factories and jobs to return to the US. It is one major pillar of his economic agenda, as is a cut in interest rates, aimed at reducing the cost of borrowing for Americans. Thenew datashows California's GDP behind the US at $29.18 trillion, China at $18.74 trillion and Germany at $4.65 trillion. It also shows California was the fastest growing among those countries. Japan's economy is under pressure because of its decreasing and ageing population, which means its workforce is shrinking and social care costs are ballooning. This week, the IMF cut its economic growth forecast for Japan and projected that  the central bank would raise interest rates more slowly than previously expected because of the impact of higher tariffs. The effect of tariffs announced on April 2 and associated uncertainty offset the expected strengthening of private consumption with above-inflation wage growth boosting household disposable income, its World Economic Outlook report said.",

    "title": "Can India really stop river water from flowing into Pakistan?",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7vjyezypqo",
    "section": "news",
    "content": "Will India be able to stop the Indus river and two of its tributaries from flowing into Pakistan? That's the question on many minds, after India suspended a major treaty governing water sharing of six rivers in the Indus basin between the two countries, following Tuesday'shorrific attackin Indian-administered Kashmir. The 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) survived two wars between the nuclear rivals and was seen as an example of trans-boundary water management. The suspension is among several steps India has taken against Pakistan, accusing it of backing cross-border terrorism -  a charge Islamabad flatly denies. It has also hit back with reciprocal measures against Delhi, and said stopping water flow will be considered as an Act of War. The treaty allocated the three eastern rivers – the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej – of the Indus basin to India, while 80% of the three western ones – the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab – to Pakistan. Disputes have flared in the past, with Pakistan objecting to some of India's hydropower and water infrastructure projects, arguing they would reduce river flows and violate the treaty. (More than 80% of Pakistan's agriculture and around a third of its hydropower depend on the Indus basin's water.) India, meanwhile, has been pushing to review and modify the treaty, citing changing needs - from irrigation and drinking water to hydropower - in light of factors like climate change. Over the years, Pakistan and India have pursued competing legal avenues under the treaty brokered by the World Bank. But this is the first time either side has announced a suspension - and notably, it's the upstream country, India, giving it a geographic advantage. But what does the suspension really mean? Could India hold back or divert the Indus basin's waters, depriving Pakistan of its lifeline? And is it even capable of doing so? Experts say it's nearly impossible for India to hold back tens of billions of cubic metres of water from the western rivers during high-flow periods. It lacks both the massive storage infrastructure and the extensive canals needed to divert such volumes. The infrastructure India has are mostly run-of-the-river hydropower plants that do not need massive storage, said Himanshu Thakkar, a regional water resources expert with the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People. Such hydropower plants use the force of running water to spin turbines and generate electricity, without holding back large volumes of water. Indian experts say inadequate infrastructure has kept India from fully utilising even its 20% share of the Jhelum, Chenab and Indus waters under the treaty - a key reason they argue for building storage structures, which Pakistan opposes citing treaty provisions. Experts say India can now modify existing infrastructure or build new ones to hold back or divert more water without informing Pakistan. Unlike in the past, India will now not be required to share its project documents with Pakistan, said Mr Thakkar. But challenges like difficult terrain and protests within India itself over some of its projects have meant that construction of water infrastructure in the Indus basin has not moved fast enough. After a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir in 2016,Indian water resources ministry officials had told the BBCthey would speed up construction of several dams and water storage projects in the Indus basin. Although there is no official information on the status of such projects, sources say progress has been limited. Some experts say that if India begins controlling the flow with its existing and potential infrastructure, Pakistan could feel the impact during the dry season, when water availability is already at its lowest. A more pressing concern is what happens in the dry season - when the flows across the basin are lower, storage matters more, and timing becomes more critical, Hassan F Khan, assistant professor of Urban Environmental Policy and Environmental Studies at Tufts University, wrote in theDawnnewspaper. That is where the absence of treaty constraints could start to be felt more acutely. The treaty requires India to share hydrological data with Pakistan - crucial for flood forecasting and planning for irrigation, hydropower and drinking water. Pradeep Kumar Saxena, India's former IWT commissioner for over six years, told the Press Trust of India news agency that the country can now stop sharing flood data with Pakistan. The region sees damaging floods during the monsoon season, which begins in June and lasts until September. But Pakistani authorities have said India was already sharing very limited hydrological data. India was sharing only around 40% of the data even before it made the latest announcement, Shiraz Memon, Pakistan's former additional commissioner of the Indus Waters Treaty, told BBC Urdu. Another issue that comes up each time there is water-related tension in the region is if the upstream country can weaponise water against the downstream country. This is often called a water bomb, where the upstream country can temporarily hold back water and then release it suddenly, without warning, causing massive damage downstream. Could India do that? Experts say India would first risk flooding its own territory as its dams are far from the Pakistan border. However, it could now flush silt from its reservoirs without prior warning - potentially causing damage downstream in Pakistan. Himalayan rivers like the Indus carry high silt levels, which quickly accumulate in dams and barrages. Sudden flushing of this silt can cause significant downstream damage. There's a bigger picture: India is downstream of China in the Brahmaputra basin, and the Indus originates in Tibet. In 2016, after Indiawarnedthat blood and water cannot flow together following a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir which India blamed on Pakistan, China blocked a tributary of the Yarlung Tsangpo - that becomes the Brahmaputra in northeast India. China, that has Pakistan as its ally, said they had done it as it was needed for a hydropower project they were building near the border. But the timing of the move was seen as Beijing coming in to help Islamabad. After building several hydropower plants in Tibet, China has green-lit what will be the world's largest dam on the lower reaches of Yarlung Tsangpo. Beijing claims minimal environmental impact, but India fears it could give China significant control over the river's flow.",

    "section": "news",
    "content": "A Dutch town hall has admitted that it most likely accidentally disposed of 46 artworks, including an Andy Warhol print of the former Dutch queen, during renovation works last year. Maashorst municipality said the works, including a 1980s silkscreen print of Queen Beatrix worth about €15,000 (£12,800), disappeared during work on a town hall last year. An investigation said the artworks were stored in a basement during renovations and a lack of guidelines for storing the artworks could have been among the reasons why they ended up being thrown away. Mayor Hans van der Pas told public broadcaster Omroep Brabant: That's not how you treat valuables. But it happened. We regret that. A statement by the municipality on Thursday said the artworks were put into storage during work on a town hall in Uden - which is being incorporated into the neighbouring municipality of Landerd to form the Maashorst municipality. It's most likely that the artworks were accidentally taken away with the trash, they said. A report by investigators found that some of the artworks were stored in wheelie bins in the basement and were not handled with care, according to local newspaper Algemeen Dagblad. The report concluded: Ownership was not properly established, no policies and procedures were established regarding the renovation and insufficient action was taken when the artworks turned out to be missing. It went on to say that a lack of guidelines for registration, storage, conservation and security of the artworks, were also contributing factors. Local media reports that the 46 artworks altogether were worth around €22,000 (£18,800) and the Maashorst municipality said it was unlikely they will ever be found. Queen Beatrix reigned as queen of the Netherlands from 1980 until she abdicated in 2013, when she was succeeded by her son King Willem-Alexander. The Queen Beatrix print was part of Warhol's series Reigning Queens, which comprised of 16 colourful prints of four monarchs, including the late Queen Elizabeth II, Margrethe II of Denmark - who abdicated in 2023 - and Queen Ntombi Twala of Eswatini, previously known as Swaziland. Warhol, considered one of the greatest artists of the 20th Century, created the prints in 1985 - two years before his death. In November last year, Warhol prints of Queen Beatrix and Ntombi Twala were stolen - and abandoned - duringa heist on a Dutch art gallery. Local police at the time said thieves took four silkscreen prints from the MPV Gallery in the North Brabant province and fled by car. But the portraits of Queen Beatrix and Queen Ntombi were later abandoned because they did not fit in the vehicle, NOS reported at the time.",

    "title": "'Very, very toxic': The risk of asbestos in Gaza's rubble",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8y4j91l83o",
    "section": "news",
    "content": "Israel's destructive military campaign in Gaza has released a silent killer: asbestos. The mineral, once widely-used in building materials, releases toxic fibres into the air when disturbed that can cling to the lungs and - over decades - cause cancer. Nowadays, its use is banned across much of the world, but it is still present in many older buildings. In Gaza, it is found primarily in asbestos roofing used across the territory's eight urban refugee camps - which were set up for Palestinians who fled or were driven from their homes during the 1948-49 Arab-Israeli war - according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). In October 2024, UNEP estimated that up to 2.3 million tons of rubble across Gaza could be contaminated with asbestos. The Gaza rubble is a very, very toxic environment, says Professor Bill Cookson, director of the National Centre for Mesothelioma Research in London. People are going to suffer acutely, but also in the longer term as well, things that children may carry throughout their lives. The lives lost now are not going to end here. The legacy is going to continue, says Liz Darlison, CEO of Mesothelioma UK. When asbestos is disturbed by something like an air strike, its fibres - too small to see with the human eye - can be breathed in by those nearby and can then work their way through to the lining of the lungs. Over many years - usually decades - they can cause scarring which leads to a serious lung condition known as asbestosis, or, in some cases, an aggressive form of lung-cancer named mesothelioma. Mesothelioma is a terrible, intractable illness, says Prof Cookson. The really worrying thing, he adds, is that it's not dose related. So even small inhalations of asbestos fibre can cause subsequent mesothelioma. It grows within the pleural cavity. It's extremely painful. It's always diagnosed late. And it's pretty well resistant to all treatments. Typically, those who contract mesothelioma do so 20 to 60 years after exposure - meaning it will take decades before the possible impact across the territory is felt. A higher level, or longer period, of exposure is believed to accelerate the progression of the disease. Dr Ryan Hoy, whose research into dust inhalation was cited by the UNEP, says it is extremely difficult to avoid breathing in asbestos fibres because they are really tiny particles that float in the air that can get very, very deep into the lungs. They are even harder to avoid, he says, because Gaza is so densely populated. The territory houses approximately 2.1 million people and is 365 sq km (141 sq miles) - about one quarter of the size of London. Experts on the ground there say people are unable to manage the risks posed by asbestos or dust inhalation due to the more immediate dangers of Israel's military offensive. At this point in time, [dust inhalation] is not something that is perceived as a worrying thing by the population. They even don't have things to eat, and they're more afraid to be killed by the bombs, says Chiara Lodi, medical co-ordinator in Gaza for the NGO Médecins Sans Frontières. The lack of awareness about the risks of asbestos, combined with the ongoing challenges [people in Gaza] face in trying to rebuild their lives, means they are unable to take the necessary measures to protect themselves, a Gaza-based spokesperson for the NGO SOS Children's Villages said. Many are not fully aware of the harmful effects of the dust and debris, they added. After a previous conflict in Gaza in 2009, a UN survey of the territory found asbestos in debris from older buildings, sheds, temporary building extensions, roofs and the walls of livestock enclosures. There are several types of asbestos ranging from so-called white asbestos, which is the least dangerous, to blue, or crocidolite, which is the most. Highly-carcinogenic crocidolite asbestos was previously found in Gaza by the UN. Globally, around 68 countries have banned the use of asbestos, though some maintain exemptions for special use. It was banned in the UK in 1999, and Israel banned its use in buildings in 2011. As well as mesothelioma, asbestos can cause other forms of lung cancer, larynx and ovarian cancer. A further, lesser known risk is that of silicosis, a lung disease caused by breathing in silica dust, usually over many years. Concrete generally contains 20-60% silica. Dr Hoy says the sheer amount of dust in Gaza could lead to an increased risk of respiratory tract infections, upper and lower airway infections, pneumonia, exacerbations of pre-existing lung disease like asthma, as well as, emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which can be worsened by acute exposure to dust. For years, the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York have been used as a case-study by health experts to examine the effects of a large toxic dust-cloud on a civilian population. The Twin Towers were not in the middle of a war zone, says Ms Darlison, so it was something we were able to measure and quantify easier. As of December 2023, 5,249 of those who were registered with the US government's World Trade Center Health Programme have died as a result of aerodigestive illness or cancer - a far higher figure than the 2,296 people who were killed in the attack itself. A total of 34,113 people were diagnosed with cancer over the same period. TheUSand a group ofArab Stateshave proposed competing plans for the reconstruction of Gaza. The UN has warned that the process will have to be managed carefully to avoid disturbing the vast amounts of asbestos-contaminated rubble. Unfortunately, says Ms Darlison, the very properties that made us use so much of it are the properties that make it difficult to get rid of. A UNEP spokesperson told the BBC that the debris removals process will increase the likelihood of asbestos disturbance and the release of hazardous fibres into the air. A UNEP assessment indicated that clearing all debris could take 21 years and cost up to $1.2 billion (£929m). The Israeli military launched its offensive on Gaza in response to Hamas's attack on Israel in October 2023 that killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 251 people taken hostage. Israel's offensive has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.",

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz798nxx4z3o",
    "section": "news",
    "content": "US federal prosecutors have filed a formal notice seeking the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of shooting dead a healthcare boss  in New York. Prosecutors argue in the filing that the 26-year-old killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson to amplify an ideological message and spark resistance to the health insurance industry. The move was made just hours ahead of his plea hearing on four federal charges later on Friday. Previously, a lawyer for Mr Mangione called the decision to seek the death penalty barbaric. Mr Thompson was shot dead outside a hotel on 4 December. Mr Mangione was arrested days later in Pennsylvania after a nationwide manhunt. He has already pleaded not guilty to state charges and is awaiting trial in a New York prison. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in April that she had directed federal prosecutors to seek capital punishment in Mr Mangione's case for the premeditated, cold-blooded assassination. She added Mr Thompson's murder was an act of political violence and it may have posed grave risk of death to additional persons nearby. Mr Mangione's lawyer, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, previously accused the government of defending the broken, immoral, and murderous healthcare industry, and said her client was caught in a tug-of-war between state and federal prosecutors. While claiming to protect against murder, the federal government moves to commit the pre-meditated, state-sponsored murder of Luigi, she added. Investigators argue that Mr Mangione was motivated to kill Mr Thompson, 50, because of anger with US health insurance companies. In the capital punishment formal notice, filed on Thursday, prosecutors say Mr Mangione poses a future danger because of his expressed intention to target the healthcare industry and rally support to his cause through violence. Mr Mangione is facing 11 state criminal counts in New York, including first-degree murder and murder as a crime of terrorism. If convicted of all the counts, he would face a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. But federal prosecutors have also separately charged Mr Mangione for using a firearm to commit murder and interstate stalking resulting in death. These charges make him eligible for the death penalty. Prosecutors have said the federal and state cases will move forward parallel with one another. Mr Thompson was shot in the back by a masked assailant in December as he was walking into a hotel where the company he led was holding an investors' meeting. A nationwide search led police to Mr Mangione five days later at a McDonald's hundreds of miles away in Altoona, Pennsylvania. The incident ignited a fraught debate about how the US healthcare system operates. Some Americans, who pay more for healthcare than people in any other country, expressed anger over what they see as unfair treatment by insurance firms.",

Those at the White House, including the president, have said it has long been the plan that Musk would soon step away, but the news came as the billionaire's car business saw earnings plunge. Musk's announcement left many unanswered questions, including when he will  actually leave the administration and what will happen to Doge, which stands for Department of Government Efficiency. When asked by the BBC on Wednesday, President Donald Trump reinforced the message that the administration was preparing for Musk's departure. We have to, at some point, let him go and do that. We expected to be doing it about this time. I'll talk to Elon about it, Trump said at the White House. The president also said Tesla will be taken care of once Musk returns and alleged that Musk was being treated very unfairly, I guess, by some of the public. He's a great patriot, and [that] should have never happened to him, Trump added. However, under government rules, spending fewer days at Doge could actually prolong Musk's stint in government. Musk has been designated a special government employee (SGE) – a label that allows him to work at a paid or unpaid government job for 130 days each year. According to a 2007Department of Justice memo, cited in an October 2024guidance documentfrom the Office of Government Ethics, any day on which an SGE performs any work for the government counts as a full day towards that limit. Measured from Trump's inauguration on 20 January, the 130-day limit - assuming Musk, who brags about working weekends, clocks roughly five days a week at Doge - would run out toward the end of May. But scaling back would extend that timeframe. Additionally, the 130-day limit would reset in January 2026. Musk has not given details on his intended schedule. He made the announcement on Tuesday, after Tesla reported financial troubles including a 71% drop in profits. The drop came after repeated Tesla takedown protests across the globe and calls for boycotts against the car manufacturer amid Musk's government role. While organisers have said most protests have been peaceful, some have beendestructive with fires set at Tesla showroomsor at charging stations. The company warned investors that the pain could continue, declining to offer a growth forecast while saying changing political sentiment could meaningfully hurt demand for the vehicles. Musk told investors on an earnings call that the time he allocates to Doge will drop significantly and that he would be allocating far more of my time to Tesla. After the comments, Tesla's languishing stock price rose. It's also unclear how many days Musk has already worked for the government, whether the government is keeping a tally, and how the limit would be enforced. There has been criticism that the Trump administration may have flouted government rules in creating Musk's unprecedented role, and concerns that he may not follow the time limit. Under rules for SGEs, Musk would have to undergo ethics training, provide a confidential financial disclosure statement, and avoid conflicts of interest. His corporate empire includes large companies that do business with the US government and foreign governments, including SpaceX, which has $22 billion in US government contracts, according to the company's chief executive. The rules also prohibit special government employees from partisan activities, including wearing clothing with political slogans, while in government offices or carrying out official duties. Musk has been pictured wearing a Make America Great Again hat in the Oval Office. Still, in February, an anonymous White House officialtold CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that Musk would file a confidential financial disclosure at some point, and had been given an ethics briefing. The following month, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the BBC: Elon Musk is selflessly serving President Trump's administration as a special government employee, and he has abided by all applicable federal laws. For now, Musk appears to serve at Trump's behest, with no clear oversight other than the president himself. In a report released last week, progressive think-tank Public Citizen criticised the Trump administration and said the White House was wildly abusing the SGE rules. Right now, the public has no way to know whether SGEs like Musk who don't file public financial disclosure reports or are permitted to oversee themselves are putting the people's interests ahead of their own, said report author Jon Golinger. The BBC has contacted Musk and the Office of Personnel Management - the agency overseeing special government employees, and one where Doge employees have reportedly taken over several functions - for comment. On Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that around 100 Doge employees would remain in various government departments after Musk departs this year. Musk and Trump set a deadline for Doge to finish its work, which corresponds to the 250th anniversary of the signing of the US Declaration of Independence. The executive order setting up Doge, signed by Trump on Inauguration Day in January, mentioned 4 July 2026 as the ending date. Earlier, in December, Musk responded to a tweet that also said Doge would finish entirely on that date. The final step of DOGE is to delete itself, he wrote.",

    "content": "Myanmar authorities have arrested an astrologer for causing panic by predicting a new earthquake in a viral TikTok video. John Moe The posted his prediction on 9 April, just two weeks after a magnitude 7.7 earthquake killed 3,500 people and destroyed centuries-old temples in the South East Asian nation. He was arrested Tuesday for making false statements with the intention of causing public panic, Myanmar's information ministry said. John Moe The had warned that an earthquake would hit every city in Myanmar on 21 April. But experts sayearthquakes are impossible to predictdue to the complexity of the factors involved in such disasters. In his video, which got more than three million views, John Moe The urged people to take important things with you and run away from buildings during the shaking. People should not stay in tall buildings during the day, read its caption. A Yangon resident told AFP that many of her neighbours believed in the prediction. They refused to stay in their homes and camped outside the day John Moe The said the earthquake would happen. His now-defunct TikTok account, which has more than 300,000 followers, claims to make predictions based on astrology and palmistry. He was arrested during a raid on his home in Sagaing, central Myanmar. The areas of Mandalay and Sagaing were hit especially hard by the earthquake on 28 March, which prompted a rare request from the Myanmar junta for foreign aid. That earthquake was felt some 1,000km away in Bangkok, where a building collapsed at a construction site, killing dozens.",

    "content": "The Vatican has released the order of service ahead of the funeral of Pope Francis on Saturday in St Peter's Square. The booklet,published on the Vatican's website, is 87 pages long and contains the service in English, Italian and Latin. There are also sections in several other languages including French and Portuguese. Thousands of mourners have been queuing to say a final goodbye before the service takes place at 10:00 local time (09:00 BST). Below is the full English version of the published text.  THE INTRODUCTORY RITES  Entrance Antiphon  Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon him.  Praise is due to you in Sion, O God. To you we pay our vows in Jerusalem. You who hear our prayer. To you all flesh will come. Our evil deeds are too heavy for us, but only you can pardon our transgressions. Blessed the one whom you choose and call to dwell in your courts. We are filled with the good things of your house, of your holy temple. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Peace be with you. And with your spirit.  Penitential Act Brethren, let us acknowledge our sins, and so prepare ourselves to celebrate the sacred mysteries. I confess to almighty God and to you, my brothers and sisters, that I have greatly sinned, in my thoughts and in my words, in what I have done and in what I have failed to do, through my fault, through my fault, through my most greivous fault; therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin, all the Angels and Saints, and you, my brothers and sisters, to pray for me to the Lord our God. May almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life.  Collect Let us pray. O God, immortal shepherd of souls, look on your people's prayers and grant that our servant Pope Francis, who presided over your Church in charity, may, with the flock entrusted to his care, receive from your mercy the reward of a faithful steward. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, for ever and ever.  THE LITURGY OF THE WORD  First Reading  'He is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead.'  A reading from the Acts of the Apostles  In those days: Peter opened his mouth and said: 'Truly I understand that God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. As for the word that he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ - he is Lord of all - you yourselves know what happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed: how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all those who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.  And we are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree, but God raised him on the third day and caused him to appear, not to all the people but to us who had been chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead. To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name'  The word of the lord. Thanks be to God.  Responsorial Psalm  The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.  Fresh and green are the pastures where he gives me repose. Near restful waters he leads me; he revives my soul. He  guides  me  along  the  right  path,  for the sake of his name. Though I should walk in the valley of the shadow of death, no evil would I fear, for you are with me. Your  crook  and  your  staff   will  give  me comfort. You  have  prepared  a  table  before  me  in the sight of my foes. My head you have anointed with oil; my cup is over flowing. Surely  goodness  and  mercy  shall  follow me all the days of my life. In the  LORD's own house shall I dwell for length of days unending.   Second Reading He will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body.  A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Philippians.  Brothers and sisters, our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await for, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself. Therefore,  my  brothers and sisters, whom  I  love  and  long  for,  my  joy  and crown,  stand  firm  thus  in  the  Lord,  my beloved.  The word of the Lord. Thanks be to God.  Acclamation before the Gospel  This is the will of my Father, says the Lord, everyone who believes in the Son should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.  Gospel  Follow me.  The Lord be with you.  And with your spirit.  A reading from the holy Gospel according to John.  Glory to you, O Lord.  Jesus  showed  himself  to  the  disciples,  In  quel  tempo,  quando  si  fu  manifesta - When  Jesus  had  revealed  himself  to  his disciples and they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, 'Simon, son of John,  do  you  love  me  more  than  these?' He  said  to  him,  'Yes,  Lord;  you  know that  I  love  you.'  He  said  to  him,  'Feed my lambs.' He said to him a second time, 'Simon son of John, do you love me?' He said to him, 'Yes, Lord;  you  know  that  I  love you.' He said to him, 'Tend my sheep.'  He  said  to  him  the  third  time,  'Simon, son  of  John,  do  you  love  me?'  Peter  was grieved because he said to him the third time,  'Do  you  love  me?'  and  he  said  to him, 'Lord,  you  know  everything;  you know  that  I  love  you.'  Jesus  said  to  him, 'Feed my sheep. Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands,  and  another  will  dress  you and carry you where you do not want to go.' (This he said to show by what kind of death he was to glorify God.) And after saying this he said to him, 'Fol - low me.' The Gospel of the Lord. Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.  Homily  Universal Prayer or Prayer of the Faithful  Brothers and sisters, let us pray to God our Father, who today brings us together to commemorate the Paschal Mystery of his only-begotten Son as we celebrate the funeral of the Pastor of the universal Church. May he welcome him into his peace and bestow every blessing upon the Church and the whole world.  Let us pray to the Lord.  Lord, hear our prayer.

God, our salvation, hear us as we make our prayer in union with the Blessed Virgin Mary and all the Saints: wel- come into the assembly of your elect the soul of your servant and our Pope Francis, who put his trust in the prayer of the Church. Through Christ our Lord.  THE LITURGY OF THE EUCHARIST  Offertory Chant  Give light to my eyes lest I fall asleep in death; lest my enemy say, 'I have pre- vailed over him'.  Pray, brethren, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the almighty Father.  May the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands for the praise and glory of his name, for our good and the good of all his holy Church.  Prayer over the Offerings  Look with favour, we pray, O Lord, on the peaceful offering of your people, with which we confidently commit to your mercy the soul of your servant Pope Francis, and grant, we pray, that, having been, in the midst of the human family, an instrument of your charity and peace, he may merit to delight in the same, for ever with all your Saints. Through Christ our Lord.   Eucharistic Prayer III  Preface  The hope of resurrection in Christ  The Lord be with you. And with your spirit. Lift up your hearts. We lift them up to the Lord. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God, through Christ our lord.  In him the hope of blessed resurrection has dawned, that those saddened by  the certainty of dying might be consoled by the promise of immortality to come. Indeed  for your faithful, Lord, life is changed not ended, and, when this earth- ly dwelling turns to dust, an eternal dwell- ing is made ready for them in heaven. And  so,  with  Angels  and  Archangels, with Thrones and Dominions, and with all  the  hosts  and  Powers  of  heaven,  we sing  the  hymn  of  your  glory,  as  without end we acclaim:  You are indeed Holy, O Lord, and all you have created rightly gives you praise, for through your Son our Lord Jesus Christ, by the power and working of the Holy Spirit, you give life to all things and make them holy, and you never cease to gather a people to yourself, so that from the rising of the sun to its setting a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name.  Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you: by the same Spirit graciously make holy these gifts we have brought to you for consecration, that they may become the Body and Blood of your Son our Lord Jesus Christ, at whose command we celebrate these mysteries.  For on the night he was betrayed he him- self took bread, and giving you thanks, he said the blessing, broke the bread and gave it to his disciples, saying:  Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is my Body, which will be given up for you.  In a similar way, when supper was end- ed, he took the chalice, and giving you thanks, he said the blessing, and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying:  Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this is the chalice of my Blood, the Blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.  Do this in memory of me.   The mystery of faith.   We proclaim your Death, O Lord, and profess your Resurrection until you come again.  Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial of the saving Passion of your Son, his wondrous Resurrection and Ascension into heaven, and as we look forward to his second coming, we offer you in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice.  Look, we pray, upon the oblation of your Church and, recognizing the sacrificial Victim by whose death you willed to reconcile us to yourself, grant that we, who are nourished by the Body and Blood of your Son and filled with his Holy Spirit, may become on body, one spirit in Christ.  May  he  make  of  us  an  eternal offering to  you,  so  that  we  may  obtain  an  in- heritance with your elect, especially with the  most  Blessed  Virgin  Mary,  Mother of God, with blessed Joseph, her Spouse, with  your  blessed  Apostles  and  glori- ous  Martyrs,  and  with  all  the  Saints, on  whose  constant  intercession  in  your presence we rely for unfailing help.  May  this  Sacrifice  of  our  reconciliation, we  pray,  O  Lord,  advance  the  peace  and salvation  of  all  the  world.  Be  pleased  to confirm  in  faith  and  charity  your pil- Grim Church  on  earth,  with  the  Order of Bishops, all the clergy, and the entire people you have gained for your own.  Listen  graciously  to  the  prayers  of  this family,  whom  you  have  summoned  be- fore  you:  in  your  compassion,  O  merci- ful  Father,  gather  to  yourself  all  your children scattered throughout the world.  Remember  your  servant  Pope  Francis whom you have called from this world to yourself.  Grant  that  he  who  was  united with  your  Son  in  a  death  like  his,  may also be one with him in his Resurrection, when  from  the  earth  he  will  raise  up  in the flesh those who have died, and trans- form our lowly body after the pattern of his  own  glorious  body.  To  our  departed brothers and sisters, too, and to all who were  pleasing  to  you  at  their  passing from  this  life,  give  kind  admittance  to your  kingdom. There we hope to enjoy for ever the fullness of your glory, when you  will  wipe  away  every  tear  from  our eyes. For seeing you, our God, as you are, we shall be like you for all the ages and praise  you  without  end,  through  Christ our Lord, through whom you bestow on the world all that is good.  Through him, and with him, and in him, O God, almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is yours, for ever and ever.   THE COMMUNION RITE  At the Saviour's command and formed by divine teaching, we dare to say:   Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed by thy name; thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil, graciously grant our peace in our days, that, by the help of your mercy, we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress, as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our Saviour, Jesus Christ.  For the kingdom, the power and the glory are yours now and for ever.  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your Apos- tles:  Peace  I  leave  you,  my  peace  I  give you, look not on our sins, but on the faith of your Church, and graciously grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will. Who live and reign for ever and ever.   The peace of the Lord be with you always. And with your spirit.  Let us offer each other the sign of peace.  Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb. Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.  Communion Antiphon  Let perpetual light shine upon him, with your Saints for ever, foy you are merci- ful.   Out of the depths I cry to you, O LORD; LORD, hear my voice!  O let your ears be attentive to the sound of my pleadings.  If you O LORD, should mark iniquities, LORD, who could stand?  But with you is found forgiveness, that You may be revered.  I long for you, O LORD, my soul longs for his word.  My soul awaits the LORD more than watchmen for daybreak  More than watchmen for daybreak, let Is- rael hope for the LORD.  For with the LORD there is mercy, in him is plentiful redemption  It is he who will redeem Israel from all its iniquities.   Like  the  deer  that  yearns  for  running streams, so my soul is yearning for you, my  God.  My  soul  is  thirsting  for  God, the  living  God;  when  can  I  enter  and appear before the face of God? My tears have become my bread, by night, by day, as I hear it said all the day long: 'Where is your God?'  Prayer after Communion  Let us pray. As  we  come  to  the  table  of  your  eternal banquet,  we  humbly  beg  your  mercy, Lord, for the soul of your departed serv- ant  Pope  Francis,  that  he  may  rejoice  at last  in  possession  of  the  truth  in  which he  faithfully  confirmed  your  people. Through Christ our Lord.

Through Christ our Lord.  Prayer of the Eastern Churches (from the Funeral Office of the Byzantine Liturgy)   God  of  our  salvation,  grant  rest  to  the soul of your servant. Lover of mankind, lead him, with the souls of the just, to the blessings of eternal life in your presence. Guide  the  soul  of  your  servant  to  the place   of   your   rest,   Lord,   where   your Saints  repose,  you  who  alone  are  im- mortal. Glory  be  to  the  Father,  and  to  the  Son, and to the Holy Spirit. You  are  our  Saviour,  our  God,  who  de- scended  into  hell  and  freed  those  im- prisoned there from its pains; now grant repose to the soul of your servant. As  it  was  in  the  beginning,  is  now,  and ever shall be. Amen. May the Blessed Virgin Mary, most pure and immaculate, who without loss to her virginity  became  the  Mother  of  God, pray for the salvation of the soul of your servant.  Have mercy on us, O God, in your great kindness; we beseech you, hear us and be merciful.  Lord, have mercy.  Again,  let  us  pray  for  the  repose  of  the soul  of  this  departed  servant  of  God Francis, Bishop, that he may be forgiven his every sin and failing.  Lord, have mercy.  May  the  Lord  God  lead  his  soul  to  the resting place of the righteous. Let us ask Christ,  our  immortal  King  and  God, to  bestow  on  him  the  divine  mercy,  the kingdom  of  heaven,  and  the  forgiveness of his sins.  Hear us, Lord.  Let us pray to the Lord.  Lord, have mercy.  God of souls and of all flesh, who tram- pled  death  underfoot,  vanquished  the devil and gave life to the world, grant re- pose to the soul of your departed Servant Francis,  Bishop,  in  a  place  of  light  and joy,  a  verdant  place,  a  place  of  blessed- ness,  where suffering,  pain  and  sorrow are no more. Forgive   every   sin   he   committed in thought, word or deed, for you are a gra- cious  God  and  a  friend  to  mankind.  No one  who  lives  is  without  sin;  you  alone are sinless, your righteousness is eternal and your word is truth. For  you,  O  Christ  our  God,  are  the  res- urrection, the life and the repose of your Servant  Francis,  Bishop,  who  has  fallen asleep.  We  give  you  glory,  with  your eternal   Father   and   your   Holy   Spirit, who is gracious and the giver of life, now and forever.  Amen.  May your remembrance be eternal, dear brother, worthy of blessedness, never to be forgotten. Amen.  Responsory  I know that my Redeemer lives: on the last day I shall rise again.  And in my flesh I shall see God my saviour.  I shall see him myself, face to face and my own eyes shall behold him.  And in my flesh I shall see God my saviour.  Within my heart this hope I cherish:  That in my flesh I shall see God my saviour.  Gracious  Father,  we  commend  to  your mercy   our   Pope   Francis  whom you made  Successor  of  Peter  and  Shepherd of  the  Church,  a  fearless  preacher  of your Word and a faithful minister of the divine mysteries.  Welcome  him,  we  pray,  into  your  heav- enly dwelling place, to enjoy eternal glo- ry with all your chosen ones. We give you thanks, Lord, for all the blessings that in your  goodness  you  bestowed  upon  him for the good of your people.   Grant  us  the  comfort  of  faith  and  the strength of hope.  To  you  Father,  source  of  life,  through Christ,  the  conqueror  of  death,  in  the life-giving Spirit, be all honour and glo- ry for ever and ever.  Antiphons  May  the  angels  lead  you  into  paradise; may the martyrs come and welcome you and take you to the holy city, the new and eternal Jerusalem.    May  choirs  of  angels  welcome  you  and with  Lazarus,  who  is  poor  no  longer, may you have eternal rest.  Canticle of the Blessed Virgin Mary Lk 1: 46-55  My soul magnifies the Lord,  and  my  spirit  rejoices  in  God  my  Sav- iour,  for he  has  looked  on  the  humble  estate  of his servant. For behold, from now on all generations  will  call  me  blessed;  for  he who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name.  And his mercy is  for  those  who  fear  him  from generation to generation.  He has shown strength with his arm; he has  scattered  the  proud  in  the  thoughts of their hearts;  he has brought down the mighty  from their  thrones  and  exalted  those  of  hum- ble  estate;  he  has   filled  the hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away empty.  He  has  helped  his  servant  Israel,  in  re- membrance of his mercy,  as he spoke to  our  fathers,  to  Abraham and  to  his  offspring for ever.  Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit,  as it was in the beginning,  is  now,  and ever  shall  be,  world without end. Amen.",

    "content": "Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to attend Pope Francis's funeral on Saturday in St Peter's Square, among them world leaders, Catholic officials and mourners from around the globe. Many heads of state and royals have confirmed their attendance,including Prince William, French President Emmanuel Macron, Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia, and Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Political figures will be out in full force at the ceremony, the most prominent gathering of world leaders since US President Donald Trump's inauguration. Pope Francis's vocal opinions on global issues occasionally put him at odds with leaders - some of whom will be at the funeral. Starmer, who No 10 confirmed would attend, described Pope Francis's leadership as courageous in a statement following his death and said he was a pope for the poor, the downtrodden and the forgotten. Prince William will attend the funeral on behalf of his father, King Charles III, in keeping with recent tradition. The King, when he was Prince of Wales, attended the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005 on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II. King Charles and Queen Camilla were among the last high-profile figures meetthe Pope at his residence Casa Santa Marta during a royal visit to Italy earlier this month. The King paid tribute to Pope Francis's compassion and said through his care for both people and planet, he profoundly touched the lives of so many. He said he and the Queen remembered with particular affection their meetings with the Pope over the years, and were greatly moved to have been able to visit him earlier in the month. Lula, who shared a personal rapport with the Pope, and first lady Janja Lula da Silva, will attend the funeral. Brazil is home to the world's largest Catholic population, with over 100 million Catholics. Following news of Pope Francis's death on Monday, Lula declared seven days of mourning. Humanity loses today a voice of respect and welcome for others, Lula said. Noting the meetings he had held with the Pope over the years, Lula said: We were able to share our ideals of peace, equality, and justice - ideals that the world has always needed, and will always need. Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that he and first lady Melania would attend the Pope's funeral, marking the first foreign trip of his second term as US president. After news of the Pope's death emerged, Trump ordered that all federal and state flags be flown at half-mast in honour of the late pontiff. He called Pope Francis a very good man who loved the world and he especially loved people that were having a hard time. The pair clashed in the past. In 2016, Pope Francis criticised Trump's proposal to build a wall on the US-Mexico border, saying a person who thinks only about building walls and not building bridges, is not Christian. Trump hit back, saying: For a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful. AfterTrump met the Pope during a trip to the Vatican in 2017, he said: He is something, he's really good. We had a fantastic meeting. In February, Pope Francis described Trump's mass deportations as a major crisis. Marcos Jr, who will be in attendance on Saturday, described Francis as the best Pope in my lifetime. A man of profound faith and humility, Pope Francis led not only with wisdom but with a heart open to all, especially the poor and the forgotten, he said. The Philippines is one of the world's most Catholic countries, with almost 80% of Filipinos identifying as Roman Catholic. Pope Francis's last visit to the country in 2015 drew a crowd ofsix million people at an outdoor Mass in the capital city Manila, a record for a papal event. In the running to become the next Pope is Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle, a Cardinal from the Philippines. Cardinal Tagle has been called the Asian Francis because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants. The Ukrainian president has said he will travel to Vatican City with first lady Olena Zelenska for the funeral. He knew how to give hope, ease suffering through prayer, and foster unity, Zelensky wrote on X in tribute to Pope Francis. He prayed for peace in Ukraine and for Ukrainians. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Francis maderepeated calls for peace and an end to the war. The two leaders met several times at the Vatican, most recently last October. Following that meeting, Pope Francis wrote on X: All nations have the right to exist in peace and security. Their territories must not be attacked, and their sovereignty must be respected and guaranteed through peace and dialogue. Earlier in 2024, Ukrainehad strongly rejecteda call by the pontiff for Kyiv to negotiate an end to the war and have the courage to raise the white flag.

    "content": "The funeral of Pope Francis will take place on Saturday, in front of St Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. Preparations have begun for the conclave, the process by which cardinals will elect the next Pope. The Pope's body is lying in state inside St Peter's Basilica. Tens of thousands of mourners have queued to say a final goodbye before his funeral takes place on Saturday, at 10:00 local time (09:00 BST). Papal funerals have historically been very elaborate, but the instructions set out by Francis are much simpler. He will be the first Pope in more than a century not to be buried inside the Vatican. Instead, he will be laid to rest in Rome's Basilica of St Mary Major. Francis asked to be buried in a simple wooden casket lined with zinc - unlike his predecessors, who were buried in three nesting coffins made of cypress, lead and oak. The service will be led by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, dean of the College of Cardinals. Patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, and priests from across the globe will also take part. After a concluding prayer formally entrusting the Pope to God, the pontiff's body will be moved to St Mary Major for the burial. A nine-day mourning period will then begin. Dozens of world leaders and thousands of worshippers will be at the funeral. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, US President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and French President Emmanuel Macron have said they will attend, as has Javier Milei, the president of Argentina, Francis's home country. The Prince of Wales will represent King Charles. Read more: Pope Francis died on Easter Monday aged 88, following a stroke and subsequent irreversible heart failure. The death was confirmed and announced by the Pope's camerlengo, or chamberlain - currently Irish-American cardinal Kevin Farrell. The camerlengo manages the various procedures and rites which follow the death of a Pope. As part of this, Cardinal Farrell locked and sealed the Pope's home, and destroyed the Pope's ring and lead seal, which is used to authenticate official documents. The camerlengo also organises the conclave to elect the new pope. They can become pope, but this has only happened twice: Gioacchino Pecci (Pope Leo XIII) in 1878 and Eugenio Pacelli (Pope Pius XII) in 1939. Read more: The new Pope is elected by the cardinals - all menwho were appointed by the Pope and are usually ordained bishops. There are currently 252 Catholic cardinals, but only 135 can cast ballots as those over the age of 80 can take part in debate but cannot vote. Traditionally the conclave doesn't start until after a 15-day mourning period. However, in 2013, Francis's predecessor Benedict changed the rules to allow it to begin earlier if the cardinals wished. Read more: During the voting period, the cardinals are cut off from the outside world – denied phones and access to the internet or newspapers. They sleep in Casa Santa Marta, a five-story guesthouse within the Vatican complex. The election is held in strict secrecy inside the Sistine Chapel, famously painted by Michelangelo. Each cardinal votes for the candidate they wish to become Pope. They can vote for themselves if they wish. A new Pope is elected when a candidate has secured the support of 90 cardinals - which can take several rounds of voting. In previous centuries, conclaves have gone on for weeks or months. Some cardinals have even died during the process. Read more: To the outside world, the only information about how the conclave is progressing is smoke from the chapel's chimney when ballot papers are burned after each round of voting. Black smoke signals failure. White smoke means a new Pope has been chosen. The new Pope normally appears on the balcony overlooking St Peter's Square within an hour of his selection. The senior cardinal confirms the decision with the words Habemus Papam - Latin for we have a Pope - and introduces the new pontiff by his chosen papal name. For example, Pope Francis was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, but chose his papal name to honour St Francis of Assisi. In theory, any Roman Catholic man who has been baptised can be considered. In practice, however, the cardinals prefer to select one of their own. In 2013, Francis became the first pontiff to hail from Latin America - a region that accounts for around 28% of the world's Catholics - and the southern hemisphere. Historical precedent suggests the cardinals are far more likely to pick a European. Of the 266 popes chosen to date, 217 have been from Italy. Several Vatican analysts have suggested Francis's successor could come from outside Europe - not least because the late Pope appointed more than 140 cardinals from beyond the continent. The Pope is the head of the Catholic Church, and is an important source of authority for the world's roughly 1.4 billion Roman Catholics. They believe the Pope represents a direct line back to Jesus Christ. He is considered a living successor to St Peter, who was chief among Christ's initial disciples, the Apostles. About half of all Christians worldwide are Roman Catholics. Other denominations, including Protestants and Orthodox Christians, do not recognise the Pope's authority. The Pope lives in Vatican City, the smallest independent state in the world. It is surrounded by the Italian capital, Rome. The Pope does not receive a salary, but all his travel costs and living expenses are paid for by the Vatican.",

    "title": "Mass food poisonings cast shadow over Indonesia's free school meals",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77ne2vnkg3o",
    "section": "news",
    "content": "Indonesia is on an ambitious mission to offer free meals to 80 million school children - but that hasn't exactly gone according to plan. Nearly 80 students across two high schools in Cianjur, south of the capital Jakarta, fell ill after eating the meals this week. Most of those who ended up in hospital have since been discharged. This is the latest in a series of food poisonings that have been linked to the programme, a signature policy of President Prabowo Subianto. Authorities investigating the case say the suspected cause is negligent food preparation. Samples from the vomit of students have been sent for lab testing, and police say they have questioned people handling the food, from cooks to packers to delivery workers. A 16-year-old student told local media that the shredded chicken in the meal had an unpleasant odour. I felt dizzy, nauseous and vomited, he said. Across the world, programmes offering free meals to students have proved to be effective in improving health, academic performance and attendance. But Indonesia's $28bn (£21bn) version - shaping up to be the most expensive of its kind - has become the target of food safety concerns and heated anti-government protests. In February, when thousands took to the streets to protest at budget cuts, they aimed their ire at the hefty price of Prabowo's free school meals: Children eat for free, parents are laid off, read one of their protest signs. A centrepiece of Prabowo's presidential campaign last year, the free meals programme was pitched as a way to tackle stunting - a condition caused by malnutrition that affects a fifth of children below the age of five in Indonesia. Through this initiative, our children will grow taller and emerge as champions, Prabowo said in 2023. Since he took office last October, this programme, along with other populist policies like new houses and free medical check-ups, has earned him political points. His approval ratings stood at 80% after his first 100 days in power. In the first phase, which began in January, free school meals have made their way to 550,000 students in 26 provinces. While the programme is well-intentioned, Maria Monica Wihardja, a visiting fellow at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, told the BBC there has been no evidence of widespread urgency for free school meals. According to a national survey in 2024, less than 1% of Indonesia's households went at least one day without any meals in the past year. Since January, a series of food poisonings have raised apprehension about the free meals. Michelle, an elementary school student in East Nusa Tenggara province, was one of several in her school who suffered suspected food poisoning in February. She told BBC Indonesian at the time that the food, which had given her a stomach ache, was bland and stale. After the incident, some parents started preparing homemade lunches for their children instead, a school official told BBC Indonesian. This week, after the food poisoning in Cianjur, authorities have promised to step up food safety processes. We must improve quality, said Dadan Hindayana, head of the National Nutrition Agency, who had visited the students in hospital. ⁠One obvious thing is the lack of mature and in-depth planning before this program was launched, Eliza Mardian, a researcher at the Center of Reform on Economics Indonesia, told the BBC. The haste ends up sacrificing quality and effectiveness, which actually worsens the public's perception of this programme. The cost of the programme has not helped matters. Indonesia has set aside more than $10bn this year for the free school meals. By comparison, India spends $1.5bn a year to feed 120 million children in what is the world's largest such programme. Brazil's version costs about the same and serves some 40 million students. To foot the steep bill in Indonesia, Prabowo has urged the country's tycoons to help, and accepted a funding offer from China. He also ordered $19bn in cuts to pay for it, along with other populist schemes - which made it especially controversial. Several ministries, including education, had their budgets slashed by half. Bureaucrats who were not furloughed alleged they were forced to scrimp by limiting the use of air conditioning, lifts and even printers. University students were furious as news spread of cancelled scholarship programmes and disruptions to their classes. The worst thing is when the stomach is full, but the brain is not filled, Muhammad Ramadan, a student protester in Bandung, told BBC Indonesian - referring to Prabowo's school meals plan. There could be more challenges ahead, such as allegations of budget mismanagement, which have begun to emerge after Indonesia's anti-graft bureau flagged a real possibility of fraud in March. Police launched an investigation this month after a meal provider in south Jakarta accused authorities of embezzlement, saying that she has not been paid since her kitchen started preparing school meals in February. Prabowo, who has continued to defend the programme, said this week that his administration will handle the allegations and  safeguard every cent of public money. Experts, however, say the problem runs much deeper. Large-scale social assistance programmes in Indonesia have historically been riddled with corruption, Muhammad Rafi Bakri, a research analyst at Indonesia's audit board, told the BBC. Given the sheer size of the budget, he said, this program is a goldmine for corrupt officials. With reporting from BBC Indonesian",

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj3x2z6k3ljo",
    "section": "news",
    "content": "The Netherlands, March 2025. Yungblud is leaving his hotel in Amsterdam when he's approached by a fan in floods of tears. You saved my life,she sobs. No, you saved your own life, he replies, quietly. Maybe the music was the soundtrack, but you saved your own life, OK? Leaning in for a hug, he adds, Don't be sad, be happy. I love ya. It's a remarkably touching moment, full of compassion and devoid of rock star ego. Two weeks later, after a video of the encounter goes viral, Yungblud is still moved by the memory. I didn't think people would see that, except me and her, he says, but it was such a moment for me. The interaction crystallised something he'd felt for a while. I always said that Bowie and My Chemical Romance saved my life, but ultimately you have to find yourself, he says. Like this morning, I put my headphones on and I listened to [The Verve's] Lucky Man, and it made me go, 'Oh, I'm ready to face the day'. But Richard Ashcroft didn't tell me I was ready to face the day. I said that to myself. That's what I was trying to tell that girl in Amsterdam.  Self-assurance is a lesson he learned the hard way. On the surface, Yungblud, aka 27-year-old Dominic Harrison, had it all. Two number one albums, an international fanbase,a Louis Theroux documentaryand enough clout to run his own festival. But if you looked more closely, there were chinks in the armour. Those number one albums both fell out of the Top 30 after one week, a sign of a strong core fanbase, with limited crossover appeal. And the first year of his Bludfest in Milton Keynes was criticised afterlong queues and a lack of watercaused fans to pass out and miss the concert. Harrison was keenly aware of it all. As he released his self-titled third album in 2022, he hit a low. Yungblud was number one in seven countries, and I wasn't happy because it wasn't the album I wanted to make, he says. It was a good album, but it wasn't exceptional. The problem, he says, was a record label who'd pushed him in a more commercial direction. But in polishing his sound, he lost the angry unpredictability that characterised his best work. It's funny, my-self titled album was actually the one where I was most lost, he observes. I felt like I compromised but, because of that, I was never taking no for an answer again. Nowhere is that clearer than on his comeback single,Hello Heaven, Hello. Over nine minutes and six seconds it achieves Caligulan levels of excess, full of scorching guitar solos, throat-shredding vocal runs, and even an orchestral coda. Do you still remember, or have you forgotten where you're from? Harrison asks himself, as he re-ignites his ambition. The song's purposefully unsuited to radio – unlike the follow-up single, Lovesick Lullaby. Released today, it's a free-associating rampage through a messy night out, that ends with epiphany in a drug dealer's apartment. Combining Liam Gallagher's sneer with Beach Boys' harmonies, it's uniquely Yungblud. But the singer reveals it was originally written for his last album.  We were actually discouraged from doing it, he says. My advisor at the time, a guy called Nick Groff [vice president of A&R at Interscope, responsible for signing Billie Eilish], was like, 'I don't get it'. Warming to the theme, he continues: The music industry is crap because it's all about money but, as an artist, I need to make sure that anything I put out is exciting and unlimited. It can't be like a 50% version of me. To achieve that, he shunned expensive recording studios and made his new album in a converted Tetley brewery in Leeds. Professional songwriters were banished, too, in favour of a close group of collaborators, including guitarist Adam Warrington, and Matt Schwartz, the Israeli-British producer who helmed his 2018 debut. When you make an album in LA or London, everything is great, even if it's mediocre, because people want a hit out of it, he argues. When you make an album with family, all they want is the truth. One of the most honest tracks on the record is Zombie, a lighters-aloft ballad (think Coldplay, sung by Bruce Springsteen) about feeling you're ugly, and learning to battle that. I always was insecure about my body, and that got highlighted as I got famous, says the singer, who last year revealed he'ddeveloped an eating disorderdue to body dysmorphia. But I realised, the biggest power you can give someone over you is in how you react. So I decided, I'm going to get sober, I'm going to get fit, and I discovered boxing. He ended up working with the South African boxer Chris Heerden - who was recently in the news afterRussia jailed his ballerina girlfriend, Ksenia Karelina. I met him before all that, says Harrison, but he's been extremely inspirational. Boxing's become like therapy for me. If someone says something bad about me, I go to the gym, hit the punch bag for an hour and talk it out. Fans have noticed the change… drooling over photos of his newly chiseled torso, and declaring 2025 his shirt-off era. Maybe the shirt-off era is a comeback to all the comments I've had, he laughs. I'm claiming a freedom and a sexiness and a liberation. He's clearly found a degree of serenity, without surrendering the restless energy that propelled him to fame. Part of that is down to control. In January,he created a new companythat brings together his core business of recorded music with touring operations, his fashion brand and his music festival, Bludfest. The event kicked off in Milton Keynes last summer but suffered teething troubles, when fans were stuck in long queues. I will fully take responsibility for that, says the star, who claims he was backstage screaming at police and promoters to get the lines moving. The problem was, there were six gates open when there should have been 12, he says, suggesting people underestimated his fans' dedication. When Chase and Status had played [there] a day before, there were 5,000 people when the doors opened, and another 30,000 trickled in during the day. With my fans, there were 20,000 kids at the gate at 10am. So we've learned a lot for this year. There'll be pallets of water outside. It'll be very different.  Dedication to his fans is what makes Yungblud Yungblud. He built the community directly from his phone and, whether intended or not, that connection has sustained his career - insulating him from the tyrannies of radio playlists and streaming placement. Maintaining a personal relationship becomes harder as his fanbase grows but, ever astute, he hired a fan to oversee his social accounts. She's called Jules Budd. She used to come to my gigs in Austin and she'd sell confetti to pay for gas money to the next city. She built an account called Yungblud Army, and she's amazing at letting me understand what are people feeling. If people are outside and security aren't treating them right, I know about it because she's in contact with them. So I brought her in to make the community safer as it gets bigger. With his new album, he wants to make that community even bigger. Harking back to the sounds of Queen and David Bowie, he says it'll reclaim the good chords (Asus4 and Em7, in case you're wondering). The shackles are off, he grins. We made an album to showcase our ambition and the way we want to play. Can you imagine seeing Yungblud in a stadium? 100% yes. Let's do it.",

    "title": "Who will win the race to develop a humanoid robot?",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62jxdxng7do",
    "section": "news",
    "content": "It's a bright spring morning in Hanover, Germany, and I'm on my way to meet a robot. I have been invited to see the G1, a humanoid robot built by Chinese firm, Unitree, at the Hannover Messe, one of the world's largest industrial trade shows. Standing at about 4'3 (130cm), G1 is smaller and more affordable than other humanoid robots on the market, and has such a highly fluid range of motion and dexterity that videos of it performing dance numbers andmartial arts have gone viral. Today the G1 is being controlled remotely by Pedro Zheng, the Unitree sales manager. He explains that customers must program each G1 for autonomous functions. Passers-by stop and actively try to engage with the G1, which cannot be said for a lot of the other machines being shown off in the cavernous conference room. They reach out to shake its hand, make sudden movements to see if it will respond, they laugh when G1 waves or bends backwards, they apologise if they bump into it. There's something about its human shape that, uncanny as it is, sets people at ease. Unitree is just one of dozens of companies around the world developing robots that have a human form. The potential is huge - for business it promises a workforce that doesn't need holidays or pay rises. It could also be the ultimate domestic appliance. After all, who wouldn't want a machine that could do the laundry and stack the dishwasher. But the technology is still some way off. While robotic arms and mobile robots have been common in factories and warehouses for decades, conditions in those workplaces can be controlled and workers can be kept safe. Introducing a humanoid robot to a less predictable environment, like a restaurant or a home, is a much more difficult problem. To be useful humanoid robots would have to be strong, but that also makes them potentially dangerous - simply falling over at the wrong time could be hazardous. So much work needs to be done on the artificial intelligence that would control such a machine. The AI simply has not yet reached a breakthrough moment, a Unitree spokesperson tells the BBC. Today's robot AI finds basic logic and reasoning – such as for understanding and completing complex tasks in a logical way – a challenge, they said. At the moment their G1 is marketed at research institutions and tech companies, who can use Unitree's open source software for development. For now entrepreneurs are focussing their efforts on humanoid robots for warehouses and factories. The highest profile of those is Elon Musk. His car company, Tesla, is developing a humanoid robot called Optimus.In January he saidthat several thousand will be built this year and he expects them to be doing useful things in Tesla factories. Other carmakers are following a similar path. BMWrecently introduced humanoid robotsto a US factory. Meanwhile, South Korean car firm Hyundaihas ordered tens of thousandsof robots from Boston Dynamics, the robot firm it bought in 2021. Thomas Andersson, founder of research firm STIQ, tracks 49 companies developing humanoid robots - those with two arms and legs. If you broaden the definition to robots with two arms, but propel themselves on wheels, then he looks at more than 100 firms. Mr Andersson thinks that Chinese companies are likely to dominate the market. The supply chain and the entire ecosystem for robotics is huge in China, and it's really easy to iterate developments and do R&D [research and development], he says. Unitree underlines that advantage - its G1 is cheap (for a robot) with an advertised price of $16,000 (£12,500). Also, Mr Andersson points out, the investment favours Asian nations. In a recent report STIQ notesthat almost 60% of all funding for humanoid robots has been raised in Asia, with the US attracting most of the rest. Chinese companies have the added benefit of support from the national and local government. For example, in Shanghai there isa state-backed training facilityfor robots, where dozens of humanoid robots are learning to complete tasks. So how can US and European robot makers compete with that? Bristol-based Bren Pierce has founded three robotics companies and the latest, Kinisi has just launched the KR1 robot. While the robot has been designed and developed in the UK, it will be manufactured in Asia. The problem you get as a European or American company, you have to buy all these sub-components from China in the first place. So then it becomes stupid to buy your motors, buy your batteries, buy your resistors, shift them all halfway around the world to put together when you could just put them all together at the source, which is in Asia. As well as making his robots in Asia, Mr Pierce is keeping costs down by not going for the full humanoid form. Designed for warehouses and factories, the KR1 does not have legs. All of these places have flat floors. Why would you want the added expense of a very complex form factor... when you could just put it on a mobile base? he asks. Where possible, his KR1 is built with mass-produced components - the wheels are the same as you would find on an electric scooter. My philosophy is buy as many things as you can off the shelf. So all our motors, batteries, computers, cameras, they're all commercially available, mass produced parts, he says. Like his competitors at Unitree, Mr Pierce says that the real secret sauce is the software that allows the robot to work with humans. A lot of companies come out with very high-tech robots, but then you start needing a PhD in robotics to be able to actually install it and use it. What we're trying to design is a very simple to use robot where your average warehouse or factory worker can actually learn how to use it in a couple of hours, Mr Pierce says. He says the KR1 can perform a task after being guided through it by a human 20 or 30 times. The KR1 will be given to pilot customers to test this year. So will robots ever break out of factories into the home? Even the optimistic Mr Pierce says it's a long way off. My long term dream for the last 20 years has been building the everything robot. This is what I was doing my PhD work in I do think that is the end goal, but it's a very complicated task, says Mr Pierce. I still think eventually they will be there, but I think that's at least 10 to 15 years away.",

The world is deceived by the situation in the Gaza Strip, says Moumen al-Natour, a Gaza lawyer and former organiser of the 2019 anti-Hamas We Want to Live movement. Al-Natour spoke to us from the shattered remains of his city, the flimsy canvas side of the tent which now forms part of his house billowing behind him. The world thinks that Gaza is Hamas and Hamas is Gaza, he said. We didn't choose Hamas and now Hamas is determined to rule Gaza and tie our fate to its own. Hamas must retreat.  Speaking out is dangerous. Hamas has never tolerated dissent. Al-Natour seems undaunted, writing a furious column for the Washington Post at the end of March. To support Hamas is to be for Palestinian death, he wrote, not Palestinian freedom. Wasn't it dangerous to speak out in this way, I asked him. We need to take a risk and speak out, he replied without hesitation. I'm 30 years old. When Hamas took over, I was 11. What have I done with my life? My life has been wasted between war and escalating violence for nothing. Since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007 by violently ousting political rivals, a year after winning national elections, there have been three major wars with Israel and two smaller conflicts. Humanity demands that we raise our voices, al-Natour said, despite suppression by Hamas. Hamas may be busy fighting Israel, but it's not afraid to punish its critics. At the end of March, 22-year old Oday al-Rubai was abducted by armed gunmen from a refugee shelter in Gaza City. Hours later, his body was found covered in horrific wounds. The Palestinian Independent Commission for Human Rights said Oday had been tortured, calling his death a grave violation of the right to life and an extrajudicial killing. Al-Rubai had participated in recent anti-Hamas protests. His family blamed Hamas for his death and demanded justice. Days earlier, a frightened al-Rubai posted a dark, grainy video on social media in which he expressed his fear that Hamas militants were coming for him. Gaza has become a city of ghosts, he said, glancing over his shoulder. I'm stranded in the street, not knowing where to go. I don't know why they're after me. They destroyed us and brought ruin to us. At his funeral, a small crowd demanded revenge and repeated demands for Hamas to get out of Gaza. Last summer,Amin Abed almost suffered the same fate, following his decision to speak out against Hamas. Masked militants beat him senseless, broke bones all over his body and damaged his kidneys. Abed survived but had to seek medical treatment abroad. Now living in Dubai, he's still involved in the protest movement, and believes that Hamas' authority is diminished. Hamas' power has begun to fade, he told me. It targets activists and civilians, beats and kills them to scare people. But it's not how it was before. Before the ceasefire collapsed last month, Hamas fighters seemed intent on highly visible displays of power. But now, with Israel once again attacking relentlessly, the same gunmen have retreated underground and Gaza's civilians have been plunged back into the misery of war. Some of the more recent protests suggest that civilians, driven to the edge of madness by a year and a half of Israeli bombardment, are losing their fear of Hamas. Beit Lahiya, at the northern end of the Gaza Strip, has seen some of the most vociferous opposition. In a series of voice notes, an eyewitness – who asked not to be named – described several recent incidents in which local residents prevented Hamas fighters from carrying out military actions from inside their community. On 13 April, he said, Hamas gunmen tried to force their way into the house of an elderly man, Jamal al-Maznan. They wanted to launch rockets and pipes [a derogatory term used for some of Hamas' home-made projectiles] from inside his house, the eyewitness told us. But he refused. The incident soon escalated, with relatives and neighbours all coming to al-Maznan's defence. The gunmen opened fire, injuring several people, but eventually were driven out. They were not intimidated by the bullets, the eyewitness said of the protesters. They advanced and told [the gunmen] to take their things and flee. We don't want you in this place. We don't want your weapons that have brought us destruction, devastation and death. Elsewhere in Gaza, protesters have told militants to stay away from hospitals and schools, to avoid situations in which civilians are caught up in Israeli air strikes. But such defiance is still risky. In Gaza City, Hamas shot one such protester dead. With little to lose and hopes of an end to the war dashed once more, some Gazans direct their fury equally at Israel and Hamas. Asked which side he blamed most for Gaza's catastrophe, Amin Abed said it was a choice between cholera and the plague. The protest movement of recent weeks is not yet a rebellion, but after almost 20 years of rule Hamas' iron grip on Gaza is slowly slipping.",

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx27r2z0zveo",
    "section": "news",
    "content": "The best friend of a woman who died from methanol poisoning on holiday has called on the government to do more to educate teenagers in schools about the dangers of drinking alcohol abroad. Bethany Clarke was travelling in Laos in south-east Asia with childhood friend Simone White when they drank free shots they were offered in a hostel in November. The following day, they both became unwell and initially thought they had food poisoning. But, a few days later, 28-year-old Simone died in hospital. The Department for Education have been contacted for a comment about Bethany's petition. Simone, who was from Orpington in south-east London, and Bethany planned to stay in Cambodia for just under two weeks, and spend four days in Laos. They fell ill after drinking six vodka shots served to them at the Nana Backpackers hostel in traveller hotspot Vang Vieng. Five other tourists also died after drinking at the hostel. Their drinks are thought to have contained methanol - a deadly substance often found in bootleg alcohol. Medical specialists say drinking as little as 25ml of methanol can be fatal, but it is sometimes added to drinks because it is cheaper than alcohol. But Bethany, 28, tells BBC Newsbeat they didn't even realise anything was wrong until the next day. This all happened on the fourth day of the trip. We did the tubing that day and that was good, she says. It's difficult to obviously describe the timeline. I think when I realised it was all going wrong was when we were on the kayaks for a trip we were doing the following morning. So just over 12 hours on. I guess that was when me and Simone were flat on the back of these kayaks, not being able to use our arms. We were just literally staring up into space. That was a moment where I thought I really don't understand what's happening to us. It just seemed like I was just having to accept my fate.  Bethany says even when they tried to get help, it took them a while to be treated for methanol poisoning and they had to search for information about it themselves. The doctors kept saying it was food poisoning, which obviously didn't help with trying to treat what was going on, she says. This is when our other friends said 'let's get to a private hospital'. In the ambulance on the way there our friend mentioned to the paramedic 'could it be methanol poisoning?' He'd done a little bit of research on his phone. They rushed Simone off to have dialysis straight away and said to me 'look can you just sign these forms and we'll do our best to save her life?' And yeah, they did their best. Bethany says the group trusted the hostel because the reviews were good but she's now urging others to be careful. We didn't think we were doing anything stupid, but obviously now I do feel like I should have known more. The advice is from me 'steer clear, drink beer'. Look up the symptoms, be mindful about where you're drinking. Just don't let it be your best friend that dies from methanol poisoning. Bethany's also set up a petition calling for the dangers of methanol poisoning to be put on the school curriculum in the UK. It says children should be taught the dangers of consuming bootleg alcohol as part of the PSHE and/or Biology curriculum in school. I think it just needs to be a five minute talk or possibly even some kind of public health advert, just giving the case study of Laos and saying this can happen, she says. If people want to take the risk and drink it, at least they've been educated and then they might even be able to spot some of the symptoms if they do happen to drink it. Bethany is currently working in Australia and has since made a full recovery. She says Simone was so full of life, energetic, sporty, musical - there's 100 adjectives I could probably come up with. She was just the best friend that anybody could hope for. If you ever had a problem she'd always be trying to help you with it and she was just such a good listener. The government has updated its information on methanol poisoning after what happened - there's a list of countries where its been reported and advice on how to spot it. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: We provided consular assistance to British nationals and their families and we remain in contact with the local authorities following an incident in Laos. The Department for Education hasn't responded to Newsbeat about the petition, but its current guidance says students should be made fully aware of the risks of types of drugs and alcohol by the time they leave school.

    "title": "China has halted rare earth exports, can Australia step up?",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86je4vyg36o",
    "section": "news",
    "content": "Australia's prime minister Anthony Albanese has pledged to invest A$1.2bn (£580m) in a strategic reserve for critical minerals if he wins next month's election, as trade tensions escalate. The announcement came after China imposed export restrictions on seven rare earth elements, essential to the production of advanced technologies - including electric vehicles, fighter jets, and robots. China's controls apply to all countries but were widely seen asretaliation to US President Donald Trump's tariffs. Albanese said Australia would prioritise minerals that are key to its security, and that of its partners, including rare earths. But could his plan challenge China's dominance? Rare earths are a group of 17 elements - named rare because they are notoriously difficult to extract and refine. Rare earths, like samarium and terbium, are critical to the production of technologies set to shape the world in the coming decades – including electric vehicles and highly advanced weapons systems. Albanese's proposed reserve includes rare earths as well as other critical minerals of which Australia is a top producer - like lithium and cobalt. Both China and Australia have rare earth reserves. But 90% of rare earth refining – which makes them usable in technology – takes place in China, giving the country significant control over supply. And that has spooked Western governments. Beijing said its restrictions on rare earths were in response to Trump's sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports to the US, currently at 145%. But analysts say Washington's inability to secure the supply of rare earths has become one of the Trump administration's chief anxieties, especially as diplomatic tensions with Beijing have deepened. Around 75% of US rare earth imports came from China between 2019 and 2022, according to the US Geological Survey. Philip Kirchlechner, director of Iron Ore Research in Perth, Western Australia, told the BBC that the US and EU had dropped the ball on recognising the importance of the rare earths over recent decades, as China swiftly developed a monopoly over refinement. China has its foot on the blood vein… of US and European defence systems, he added. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, this week said that China halting exports of rare earths used in advanced magnets was affecting the company's ability to develop humanoid robots, in an early symbol of the pain Beijing has the power to inflict on US companies. Albanese's proposal says that minerals in the reserve will be available to both domestic industry and international partners, in a likely reference to allies such as the US and EU. But Kirchlechner, while welcoming the move as long overdue, added that the proposal is not going to solve the problem. The fundamental issue is that even if Australia stockpiles more critical minerals, the refining process of rare earths will still largely be controlled by China. Lithium – not a rare earth, but a crucial metal in the production electric vehicle batteries and solar panels – is a good example. Australia mines 33% of the world's lithium, but only refines and exports a tiny fraction. China, on the other hand, mines just 23% of the world's lithium, but refines 57% of it, according to the International Energy Agency. Australia has been investing in refining rare earths as part of its Future Made in Australia plan, aimed at leveraging the country's critical minerals reserves to drive the green transition. Arafura Rare Earths, headquartered in Perth, Western Australia, last year received A$840m in funding to create the country's first combined mine and refinery for rare earths. And in November, Australia opened its first rare earths processing plant, also in Western Australia, operated by Lynas Rare Earths. But the country is expected to depend on China for refining until at least 2026, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, headquartered in Washington. China has been trying to seize on the volatility brought by Trump. In a series of editorials in Australian newspapers, China's ambassador to Canberra lambasted Washington's approach to global trade, and called on Australia to join hands with Beijing - something that Albanese quickly rejected. Australia has touted its resource industry in its talks with Trump. Some critical minerals were exempt from a 10% tariff he imposed on imports of most Australian products. But analysts say Albanese's proposal is mainly aimed at protecting Australia and its partners from strategic adversaries like China. Alicia García-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis, told the BBC that Albanese's plan was more sophisticated than previous proposals, because it included the ability to sell Australia's resources at moments of economic tension. If China imposes export controls, she added, Australia could begin selling more of its mineral reserves to help lower prices on global markets, and loosen the control China has had on setting prices. But she said that Australia still cannot completely replace China. If [Australia's] goal is to serve the West, become more instrumental to the West – especially the US – there are weak spots China can enter – and the most important is refining.",

    "section": "news",
    "content": "Israel's military has admitted killing a United Nations (UN) worker with tank fire, having previously denied responsibility, in an incident in the Gaza Strip last month. After a UN staff member was killed when a UN compound in Deir al-Balah was damaged on 19 March, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had not struck the site. But the IDF said on Thursday that the initial findings of its investigation into the incident indicated its troops had in fact killed the UN worker after wrongly identifying the building as containing an enemy presence. It said in a statement: The building was struck due to assessed enemy presence and was not identified by the forces as a UN facility. These preliminary findings have been shared with the UN and the full conclusion will also be provided, it said. It added: The IDF regrets this serious incident and continues to conduct thorough review processes to draw operational lessons and evaluate additional measures to prevent such events in the future. We express our deep sorrow for the loss and send our condolences to the family. The incident, which killed Bulgarian UN worker Marin Valev Marinov and seriously injured five other UN personnel, came a day after Israelrenewed its offensive against Hamasafter a two-month ceasefire collapsed. At the time, UN Secretary General António Guterres called for a full investigation into the incident, while a spokesperson said: The locations of all UN premises are known to the parties to the conflict, who are bound by international law to protect them and maintain their absolute inviolability. Following the attack, the UN Office for Project Services (UNOPS) said that explosive ordnance was dropped or fired at a guesthouse, which was in an isolated location. Its executive director, Jorge Moreira da Silva, said it was not an accident. The IDFsaid in a statementon the day of the attack: Contrary to reports, the IDF did not strike a UN compound in Deir el-Balah. The IDF calls on media outlets to act with caution regarding unverified reports. Footage verified by the BBC showed injured people - two wearing blue UN flak jackets - arriving at a hospital in an ambulance and a UN car. Separately, the IDFsaid earlier this weekthat professional failures had led to the killing of 15 emergency workers in an incident in Gaza last month. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says at least 1,978 people have been killed since Israel renewed its offensive on the territory,with at least 50 reported killed by Israeli strikes on Thursday. Israel says it is putting military pressure on Hamas to release the 59 hostages it is still holding, 24 of whom are believed to be alive. It has also blocked all deliveries of humanitarian aid and other supplies to Gaza for seven weeks. The UN says this is further depriving people of the means for survival and undermining every aspect of civilian life. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 51,300 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.",

In a video of the summons being delivered, Bolsonaro could be seen reacting furiously, saying: I have five days to present my defence? During the alleged coup attempt, Bolsonaro's supporters stormed government buildings. Investigations by the police outlined allegations he had personal conversations - including with figures from the armed forces - about the idea of a coup to cling onto power. His earlier intestinal surgery was in response to ongoing health issues after he was stabbed in 2018 on the campaign trail in the south eastern state of Minas Gerais. He lost around 40% of his blood and had emergency surgery, with the perpetrator later declared mentally unfit to stand trial. He has repeatedly denied coup allegations and accused his opponents of a political witch-hunt. A day before he was delivered the summons in hospital, he recorded a live YouTube broadcast from his hospital bed with three of his sons, despite a doctor's recommendation not to have visitors. The Brazilian Supreme Court argued that this showed he was able to be summoned and notified. Bolsonaro had been hoping to contest the presidential elections again in 2026, despite a current ban on running for office, but he risks a 40-year prison sentence if found guilty.",

    "content": "Top executives at well-known US firms are warning about the impact that tariffs are having on their companies and the wider economy. Technology giant Intel, footwear maker Skechers and consumer goods firm Procter & Gamble, have either cut their profit forecasts or withdrawn them citing economic uncertainty. US President Donald Trump has been trying to rebalance relations with key trading partners by using steep tariffs to bring them to the negotiating table. No new trade agreements between the US and other countries have been announced yet but there have been signs of progress in talks with South Korea. The very fluid trade policies in the US and beyond, as well as regulatory risks, have increased the chance of an economic slowdown with the probability of a recession growing, said Intel's chief financial officer, David Zinsner, during a call with investors. We will certainly see costs increase, he added as the California-based firm announced gloomy profit and revenue forecasts. Intel's shares dropped by more than 5% in extended trading after those remarks. Beyond the technology industry, footwear maker Skechers also disappointed investors. The firm's shares fell after it withdrew its annual results forecast. The current environment is simply too dynamic from which to plan results with a reasonable assurance of success, Skechers' chief operating officer, David Weinberg, told investors in a post-earnings call. Skechers - like rivals Nike, Adidas and Puma - uses factories in Asia, particularly in China, to make its products. Comments from Procter & Gamble (P&G) executives also hinted at how tariffs could mean higher prices for its customers. The maker of Ariel, Head & Shoulders and Gillette said it was considering changes to its prices to make up for the extra cost of materials sourced from China and other places. It also said it expected sales to grow this year less than previously forecast. We'll be looking for every opportunity to mitigate the impact, said Andre Schulten, P&G's financial chief, adding that there will be adjustments to some level of consumer pricing. The Japanese owner of the 7-Eleven convenience stores, Seven & I, said it is also feeling the impact of the trade tensions. North America account for more than 70% of its sales. Its incoming chief executive, Stephen Dacus, told the BBC about the uncertainty faced by the business. We don't know what those tariffs are going to be. We've seen some news recently where they have changed quite a bit so it's a little bit difficult to understand what the ultimate effect is, he said. Lowering prices and lowering quality typically doesn't work... so what you have to do... is find ways to maintain quality while bringing the cost down. They join a growing list of examples of companies around the world that have warned about the impact of Trump's trade policies. South Korean car making giant Hyundai announced on Friday that it has set up a task force to find ways to deal with the fallout from tariffs. We expect a challenging business outlook to continue due to intensifying trade conflicts and other various unpredictable macroeconomic factors, it said. It added that it is considering moving some manufacturing out of South Korea. The firm has already shifted some production from Mexico to the US, which accounts for about a third of its global sales. Meanwhile, there were signs that talks on Thursday between US and South Korean trade officials in Washington DC, aimed at removing tariffs, have been positive. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the two sides had a very successful meeting. We may be moving faster than I thought, and we will be talking technical terms as early as next week, he told reporters after the meeting. South Korea's industry minister, Ahn Duk-geun, who also took part in the talks, echoed Bessent's optimism and added that they are working toward a July package. A 90-day pause on higher tariffs affecting dozens of countries is set to expire on 8 July. Trump has said more than 70 countries have reached out to start negotiations since the tariffs were announced.",

    "section": "news",
    "content": "A Rwandan beekeeper living in the US has been arrested over his alleged involvement in the 1994 genocide in his country. Faustin Nsabumukunzi is accused of committing heinous acts of violence abroad when he served as a local leader at the start of genocide, the Justice Department said. The 65-year-old suspect was also charged with visa fraud and attempted naturalisation fraud when he moved to the US in 2003. He pleaded not guilty to the charges and was released on bail. Nsabumukunzi repeatedly lied to conceal his involvement in the horrific Rwandan genocide while seeking to become a lawful permanent resident and citizen of the United States, said John Durham, a federal prosecutor. In just 100 days in 1994, about 800,000 people were killed in Rwanda by ethnic Hutu extremists. The mainly Tutsi forces who took power following the genocide were alleged to have killed thousands of Hutu people in Rwanda in retaliation. Nsabumukunzi is alleged to have set up roadblocks during the genocide to detain and kill Tutsis and to have participated in killings, prosecutors said, citing witnesses. Nsabumukunzi used his leadership position to oversee the violence and killings of Tutsis in his local area and directed groups of armed Hutus to kill Tutsis, the federal prosecutors said. He was subsequently convicted and sentenced to life in prison in absentia by a Rwandan genocide court, according to US legal papers. The suspect was arrested on Thursday at his home in Bridgehampton, New York, where he had settled as a gardener and beekeeper in an exclusive enclave on Long Island, according to the US media. Prosecutors said he had lied to US officials in his immigration application, including by falsely denying any involvement as a perpetrator of the Rwandan genocide when he sought refugee status in 2003. He allegedly repeated those lies in his subsequent applications for a green card and naturalisation. For over two decades, he got away with those lies and lived in the United States with an undeserved clean slate, said prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York. He pleaded not guilty and was released on a bond of $250,000 (£188,000). The bail package requires home detention and GPS monitoring, but he will be allowed to continue working as a gardener. Nsabumukunzi faces a maximum of 30 years in prison, if convicted. In Rwanda, Nsabumukunzi oversaw 150 beekeepers and 1,500 hives, according to the New York Times which profiled him in 2006. In the US, he oversaw about 100 hives for the Hamptons Honey Company, which had hired him to scale up its production, the report said. Gabriel Alfaya, the owner of Hamptons Honey since 2009, said he was unaware that Nsabumukunzi had worked for the company and had never met him, the New York Times reported. Nsabumukunzi's lawyer, Evan Sugar, described his client as a law-abiding beekeeper and gardener, in an interview with the AP news agency. The lawyer said Nsabumukunzi was a victim of the Rwandan genocide who lost scores of family members and friends to the violence. He said his client was rightfully granted refugee status and lawful permanent residence and planned to fight these 30-year-old allegations while maintaining his innocence. Several people who fled Rwanda to other countries have been arrested on charges related to the killings, as the East African country continues to pursue more genocide suspects from their safe havens abroad.

    "title": "Who will be the next pope? Key candidates in an unpredictable process",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgxk40ndk1o",
    "section": "news",
    "content": "Who will be the next pope? The decision could have a profound impact on the Catholic Church and the world's 1.4 billion baptised Roman Catholics. It also promises to be a highly unpredictable and open process for a host of reasons. The College of Cardinals will meet in conclave in the Sistine Chapel to debate and then vote for their preferred candidates until a single name prevails. With 80% of the cardinals appointed by Pope Francis himself, they are not only electing a pope for the first time, but will offer a broad global perspective. For the first time in history, fewer than half of those given a vote will be European. And although the college may be dominated by his appointments, they were not exclusively progressive or traditionalist. For those reasons, it is harder than ever to predict who will be elected the next pope. Could the cardinals elect an African or an Asian pope, or might they favour one of the old hands of the Vatican administration? Here are some of the names being mentioned as Francis's potential successor. Nationality: Italian Age: 70 Softly spoken Italian Cardinal Parolin was the Vatican's secretary of state under Pope Francis – making him the pope's chief adviser. The secretary of state also heads the Roman Curia, the Church's central administration. Having acted effectively as deputy pope, he could be considered a frontrunner. He is viewed by some as more likely to prioritise diplomacy and a global outlook than the purity of Catholic dogma. His critics consider that a problem, while his supporters see a strength. But he has been critical of the legalisation of same-sex marriage around the world,  calling a landmark 2015 vote in favourin the Republic of Ireland a defeat for humanity. The bookmakers may back him but Cardinal Parolin will be well aware of an old Italian saying that stresses the uncertainty of the pope-picking process: He who enters a conclave as a pope, leaves it as a cardinal. Some 213 of the previous 266 popes have been Italian and even though there has not been an Italian pope in 40 years, the pivot of the upper echelons of the Church away from Italy and Europe may mean there may not be another for now. Nationality: Filipino Age: 67 Could the next pope come from Asia? Cardinal Tagle has decades of pastoral experience – meaning he has been an active Church leader among the people as opposed to a diplomat for the Vatican or cloistered expert on Church law. The Church is massively influential in the Philippines, where about 80% of the population is Catholic. The country currently has a record five members of the College of Cardinals – which could make for a significant lobbying faction if they all back Cardinal Tagle. He is considered a moderate within the Catholic definition, and has been dubbed the Asian Francis because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants that he shared with the late pope. He has opposed abortion rights, calling them a form of murder – a position in line with the Church's broader stance that life begins at conception. He has also spoken against euthanasia. But in 2015 when he was Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Tagle called for the Church to reassess its severe stance towards gay people, divorcees and single mothers, saying past harshness had done lasting harm and left people feeling branded, and that each individual deserved compassion and respect. The cardinal was considered a candidate to be pope as far back as the 2013 conclave in which Francis was elected. Asked a decade ago how he viewed suggestions he could be next, he replied: I treat it like a joke! It's funny. Nationality: Congolese Age: 65 It's very possible the next pope could be from Africa, where the Catholic Church continues to add millions of members. Cardinal Ambongo is a leading candidate, hailing from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). He has been Archbishop of Kinshasa for seven years, and was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis. He is a cultural conservative, opposing blessings for same-sex marriage, stating that unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil. Though Christianity is the majority religion in the DRC, Christians there have faced death and persecution at the hands of jihadist group Islamic State and associated rebels. Against that backdrop, Cardinal Ambongo is viewed as a fierce advocate for the Church. But in a 2020 interview, he spoke in favour of religious plurality, saying: Let Protestants be Protestants and Muslims be Muslims. We are going to work with them. But everyone has to keep their own identity. Such comments could lead some cardinals to wonder if he fully embraces their sense of mission - in which Catholics hope to spread the Church's word throughout the world. Nationality: Ghanaian Age: 76 If chosen by his peers, the influential Cardinal Turkson would likewise have the distinction of being the first African pope for 1,500 years. Like Cardinal Ambongo, he has claimed not to want the job. I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a pope, he told the BBC in 2013. Asked if Africa had a good case to provide the next pope based on the Church's growth on the continent, he said he felt the pope shouldn't be chosen based on statistics, because those types of considerations tend to muddy the waters. He was the first Ghanaian to be made a cardinal, back in 2003 under Pope John Paul II. Like Cardinal Tagle, Cardinal Turkson was considered a potential pope a decade later, when Francis was chosen. In fact, bookmakers made him the favourite ahead of voting. A guitarist who once played in a funk band, Cardinal Turkson is known for his energetic presence. Like many cardinals from Africa, he leans conservative. However, he has opposed the criminalisation of gay relationships in African countries including his native Ghana. In a BBC interview in 2023, while Ghana's parliament was discussing a bill imposing harsh penalties on LGBTQ+ people, Turkson said he felt homosexuality should not be treated as an offence. In 2012, he was accused of making fear-mongering predictions over the spread of Islam in Europe at a Vatican conference of bishops, for which he later apologised. Nationality: Hungarian Age: 72 A cardinal since the age of 51, Peter Erdo is highly regarded in the Church in Europe, having twice led the Council of European Bishops' Conferences from 2006 to 2016. He is well known among African cardinals and he has worked on Catholic relations with the Orthodox Church. The archbishop of Budapest and primate of Hungary grew up in a Catholic family under communism, and he is considered a potential compromise candidate. Erdo played a prominent role in Pope Francis's two visits to Hungary in 2021 and 2023, and he was part of the conclaves that elected Francis and his predecessor Pope Benedict. His conservative views on the family have found favour with some parts of the Church and he has navigated the illiberal democracy of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. During Europe's migrant crisis in 2015, he said the Church would not take in migrants as it was tantamount to human trafficking. Nationality: Italian Age: 83 Only cardinals under 80 can vote in the conclave, but Angelo Scola could still be elected. The former Archbishop of Milan was a frontrunner in 2013 when Francis was chosen, but he is thought to have fallen victim to the adage of entering the conclave as Pope and leaving as cardinal. His name has resurfaced ahead of the conclave, because of a book he is publishing this week on old age. The book features a preface written by Pope Francis shortly before he was admitted to hospital in which he said death is not the end of everything, but the beginning of something. Francis's words show genuine affection for Scola, but the college of cardinals might  not see his focus on old age as ideal for a new pope. Nationality: German Age: 71 Germany's top Catholic cleric is also very much a Vatican insider too. The Archbishop of Munich and Freising was chosen as an adviser when Francis became pope in 2013. For 10 years he advised the Pope on Church reform and still oversees financial reform of the Vatican. He has advocated a more accommodating approach towards homosexuals or transgender people in Catholic teaching. But in 2021 he offered to resign over serious mistakes in tackling child sexual abuse in Germany's Catholic Church. That resignation was rejected by Francis. Two years ago he left the Council of Cardinals, the Pope's most important advisory body, in what was seen in Germany as a setback for his career in the Church. Nationality: Canadian Age: 80 Cardinal Ouellet has twice before been seen as a potential candidate for Pope, in 2005 and 2013. For years he ran the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, which chooses candidates for the episcopate around the world, so he has played a significant and formative role in vetting the future members of the Catholic hierarchy. As another octogenarian, he will not be able to play a part in the conclave itself, which may hinder his chances. Ouellet is viewed as a conservative with a modern outlook, who is strongly in favour of maintaining the principle of celibacy for priests. He opposes the ordination of women priests, but he has called for a greater role for women in running the Catholic Church, saying that Christ is male, the Church is feminine. Nationality: American Age: 69 Could the papacy go to an American for the first time? Chicago-born Cardinal Prevost is certainly seen as having many of the necessary qualities for the role. Two years ago Pope Francis chose Prevost to replace Marc Ouellet as prefect of the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, handing him the task of selecting the next generation of bishops. He worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made an archbishop there. Prevost is not just considered an American, but as someone who headed the Pontifical Commission for Latin America. He is seen a reformer, but at 69 might be viewed as too young for the papacy. His period as archbishop in Peru was also clouded by allegations of covering up sexual abuse claims, which were denied by his diocese. Nationality: Guinean Age: 79 Well-liked by conservatives in the Church, Cardinal Sarah is known for his adherence to doctrine and traditional liturgy and was often considered opposed to Pope Francis's reformist leanings. The son of a fruit-picker, Sarah became the youngest archbishop aged 34 when Pope John Paul II appointed him prelate in Conakry in Guinea. He has had a long and impressive career, retiring in 2021 as head of the Vatican's office that oversees the Catholic Church's liturgical rites. While not considered a favourite for the papacy, he could attract strong support from conservative cardinals. Nationality: Italian Age: 60 Ordained in Italy when he was 25, Pizzaballa moved to Jerusalem the following month and has lived there ever since. Pope Francis made him Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem five years ago and later cardinal, and Pizzaballa has spoken of the city as the heart of the life of this world. Fellow cardinals will have been impressed by his deep understanding of Israelis and Palestinians and the ongoing war in Gaza. However, his relative young age and inexperience as a cardinal may count against him, as could his affinity to Francis among cardinals seeking a change in direction. Nationality: Canadian Age: 78 Cardinal Czerny was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis and is like him a Jesuit, a leading order of the Catholic Church known for its charitable and missionary work around the world. Although he was born in the former Czechoslovakia, his family moved to Canada when he was two. He has worked widely in Latin America and in Africa, where he founded the African Jesuit Aids Network and taught in Kenya. Czerny is popular with progressives in the Church and was considered close to Pope Francis. He is currently head of the Vatican's Dicastery for Promoting Human Integral Development. Although a strong candidate, it seems unlikely the cardinals would choose a second Jesuit pope in succession.",

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2x58m46e1o",
    "section": "news",
    "content": "Vladimir Putin initially denied having anything to do with Russia's capture of Crimea in February 2014, when mysterious masked commandos in unidentified green uniforms seized the local parliament and fanned out across the peninsula. Those little green men marked the start of Russia's war on Ukraine, which culminated in the 2022 full-scale invasion. The future of Crimea is now at the centre of President Donald Trump's peace plan and has prompted Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky to rule out recognising Russian control of the peninsula. The exact terms of his plan have not been published, but reports suggest it would include the US recognising Crimea as a legal part of Russia -de jurein Latin. For Trump, Ukraine's southern peninsula was lost years ago and is not even a part of discussion in peace talks. But for Zelensky to renounce Crimea as an indivisible part of Ukraine would be unconscionable. In the words of opposition MP Iryna Gerashchenko territorial integrity and sovereignty is a red line for Ukraine and Ukrainians. Trump made the point that if [Volodymyr Zelensky] wants Crimea, why didn't they fight for it 11 years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired? Few shots were fired, but Crimea was seized at gunpoint during a power vacuum. Putin later admitted hatching the land-grab in an all-night meeting with his officials days after Ukraine's pro-Russian leader was ousted in Kyiv. For a US leader in a hurry to secure a peace deal, Crimea could become a big stumbling block. Trump is correct that there is little chance of Ukraine regaining Crimea in the foreseeable future, and it is in reality - de facto - under Russian control. But that is a far cry from recognising it as legal. Zelensky points to a 2018 Crimea declaration by Trump's then secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. Pompeo said the US rejected Russia's attempted annexation of Crimea and pledged to continue until Ukraine's territorial integrity was restored. Zelensky's implication is that Trump backed Ukraine on Crimea then, and should stick to that now. If a landgrab unrecognised by the international community is approved by the US as legal, what would that mean for international law and the principles of the UN charter? Weeks after Russia's full-scale war began, there was an initial proposal in Istanbul to park the issue so that Russia and Ukraine would aim to resolve it in the next 10-15 years. The idea did not take hold but it was a way of getting over that stumbling block. Zelensky was adamant that he has no power to give up Crimea: There's nothing to talk about here. This is against our constitution. Article 2 of the constitution states that Ukraine's sovereignty extends throughout its entire territory which within its present border is indivisible and inviolable. Any change to Ukraine's territory has to go to a national referendum, which must be authorised by the Ukrainian parliament. It is not just President Trump that has problems with Kyiv. Russia also sees the Ukrainian constitution as an obstacle to peace efforts. Constitutions can be changed, but not while Ukraine is under martial law. Approving Russia's illegal annexation would not just be a red line for Ukraine but would be a terrifying precedent for countries such as Romania that border the Black Sea. The precedent would be felt far beyond the Black Sea. For historical reasons, Russians have long seen Crimea as part of their territory and Putin has spoken of a living and unbreakable bond with the peninsula, with its Black Sea resorts and balmy summer climate. But Crimea along with the rest of Ukraine voted for independence from the collapsing Soviet Union in 1991. It had the status of autonomous republic within and Kyiv allowed Russia to lease the port of Sevastopol as a base for the Black Sea Fleet. After its annexation in 2014 Putin sought to cement Russia's control over Crimea, first with a 12-mile bridge built over the Kerch Strait in 2018 and then by capturing a land bridge along the Sea of Azov coast in 2022. Putin felt he was righting a wrong inflicted on Russia when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred Crimea to Ukraine in 1954. Russia, he said, was not simply robbed, it was plundered. Crimea was first annexed by Tsarist Russia under Catherine the Great in 1783 and largely remained part of Russia until Khrushchev's decision. Russia and Ukraine were both Soviet republics so it was not a big deal for the Kremlin in 1954. More than half the population of Crimea was Russian, mainly because the original majority population of Crimean Tatars were deported under Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin in 1944. Tatars were only able to return to Crimea from exile from 1989 as the Soviet Union fell apart, and they now make up about 15% of Crimea's population. Russia quickly organised a referendum in March 2014 but it was rejected as a sham by the international community and the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution backing Ukrainian sovereignty. The International Criminal Court ruled that Russia's activity in Crimea amounted to ongoing occupation. Refat Chubarov, Chairman of the Mejlis, a body representing Crimean Tatars, has insisted that Ukraine must categorically reject any territorial concession in exchange for peace. Crimea is the homeland of the indigenous Crimean Tatar people and an integral part of Ukraine, he said. Trump's peace plan has not yet been published, but according to various reports and remarks by US officials, Ukraine would be required to adhere to other difficult conditions. Russia's occupation of almost 20% of Ukraine would be de facto recognised behind existing front lines, in effect freezing the conflict in four Ukrainian regions: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. That would be backed up by a robust security guarantee, according to US outlet Axios, presumably backed up by a coalition of the willing involving the UK, France but not the US. There would be a promise not to admit Ukraine into Nato, although it could join the EU. All US sanctions would be lifted and economic co-operation with the US enhanced. Axios also suggests Russia would return a small occupied area of the Kharkiv region and allow Ukraine unimpeded passage on the Dnipro river, while the US would take charge of the nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia, seized by Russia in 2022. And then there is a US-Ukraine deal to share minerals profits, which Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal is expected to seal with the US by Saturday.",

    "title": "Boxing's 'anti-hero' Eubank hopes for father reconciliation",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/boxing/articles/c75devw0lzzo",
    "section": "news",
    "content": "Parading in luxury designer finery, rubbing shoulders with A-list celebrities and playing poker with filthy-rich footballers – Chris Eubank Jr has never really marketed himself as a man of the people. But, deep down, everybody wants to be liked, and the 35-year-old is no different. People say that 'he's been happy to play the bad guy'. I wasn't happy about it, Eubank says. I didn't like getting booed into arenas for all these years. I don't like waking up and going on my Instagram and seeing people saying 'you're going to get knocked out' and 'you're not as good as your old man'. The Brighton boxer says he has learned to accept, even relish, the villain tag. In the build-up to Saturday's fight with Conor Benn, however, the lines between the 'good' and 'bad' guys have blurred. Eubank will face his fellow Briton at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in boxing's latest grudge match – two and a half years after their cancelled bout because of Benn's failed drugs tests. Benn has since been cleared to fight and denies intentionally doping, but the scandal has tarnished his reputation. Consequently, it's morphed Eubank into British boxing's unlikely antihero. I don't know what to expect. This could be the first fight in history where both guys in a mega fight get booed into an arena, Eubank says. [But] however much of a bad guy I am, I didn't cheat. I walked the hard path being that bad guy. While his public image may be improving, Eubank's fractured relationship with his father, Chris Eubank Sr, has threatened to overshadow the fight. I've told him I want him there [on Saturday]. I've told him what it means to me, the public, to the fight fans, Eubank says. He doesn't seem to care or he doesn't seem to understand. Speaking to BBC Sport, an emotional Eubank opens up on their public fall-out and what happens if he loses to Benn on Saturday. As each day passes in fight week, it is becoming increasingly unlikely that Eubank Sr will attend Saturday's fight. He had been an ever-present at the start of his son's career, but their relationship has become strained. It got to a stage where I realised for the public to be able to see who I was as a man and as a fighter, I had to step away from that huge figure, Eubank says. Barry Hearn said Eubank Sr, who he promoted for a number of years, was a very strict disciplinarian as a father. He said to me once 'Bazza, how do you let your boy talk to you like that? Hearn said. I said to him 'your son has to be your friend as well, Chris'. I don't think he ever bought into that. Eubank acknowledges the public interest in his life and is open to discussing issues far more important than boxing. While he has forged a reputation of being a composed fighter, outside of the ring he has shown his emotions and vulnerability to the public, with his personal life tinged with tragedy over the past four years. In 2021, his 29-year-old brother Sebastian died of a heart attack in Dubai. Eubank has become a father figure to his nephew, who was just a month old at the time. Eubank Sr has labelled the Benn bout a circus because of the weight disparity; Benn is going up two divisions and Eubank is prohibited from rehydrating more than 10lb after the weigh-in. I think this fight once it's over, there's a possibility that things may be able to reconcile or there's a possibility it will make our relationship even harder to rebuild, Eubank Jr says. What I do know is once I am out of boxing, then it will definitely be easier for us to rebuild what's been lost. As Eubank has stepped out of his father's shadow, more of him as a man and fighter has emerged. Eubank is quite the maverick, a boxer who never pinned himself down to one promoter or trainer for a significant length of time. Recent outbursts have even landed him in legal bother and subsequent retractions. So many boxers and fighters get caught up in the treachery of the people that are in the industry, he says, describing the sport as shady. While he may have burnt bridges with influential boxing people down to a crisp, Eubank is perfectly capable of single-handedly promoting a fight. Just like Chris Eubank Sr did with Nigel Benn during their rivalry in the 1990s, Jr – minus his father's monocle and jodhpurs - seems to know which buttons will inflame an opponent. He says that targeting Benn's emotions is not a deliberate ploy, though. I've never thought I need to think of something that's really going to get to Conor. I don't care about Conor. I only care about me, Eubank says. Referencing the now-infamous incident when he slapped Benn across the face with an egg – which resulted in a £100,000 fine – Eubank feels he kept his composure. I had Nigel Benn's hand wrapped around my neck at one point, but if you see my face, it's like I'm walking down the street, he says. I'm not angry, I'm not scared, I'm not worried. I'm just looking at him. I'm not wasting energy on these guys. Eubank has proven his quality with wins over former world champions Arthur Abraham, James DeGale and Liam Smith. He has a lot to be proud of. He is fully aware, however, that a defeat to Benn could end up defining his 14-year career. There's so much at stake – respect, family, pride, money and my career. I said it, if I lose I retire. That is a horrible thing to say and to know but it's the truth, he says. Evaluating Eubank's boxing career depends on how you measure success. In 37 fights, he is yet to capture a world title. He lost his only challenge for world honours to George Groves in 2018. If he never becomes a world champion, is it a case of unfulfilled potential? Eubank has certainly shown he is capable enough. As a commodity, though, Eubank remains one of British boxing's biggest draws. He has sold out arenas and earned seven-figure paydays. And he is not ready to give it all up just yet. I love being a fighter. I love training. I love competing. I love testing myself mentally and physically, he says. This is my life. On April 27th, I don't want to wake up and say it's done. I really don't.",

    "content": "Liverpool manager Arne Slot says his team have a big responsibility to secure the club's 20th top-flight title by getting a point against Tottenham at Anfield on Sunday. Arsenal's draw with Crystal Palace on Wednesday means the Reds need just a point against Spurs to win the Premier League with four games remaining. Liverpool last secured the title in 2019-20 under former manager Jurgen Klopp during a time when fans were not allowed into stadiums because of the Covid pandemic. The Reds lifted the trophy in an empty Anfield as they claimed their first top-flight win in 30 years. First of all, that's a big responsibility because we are aware that the last time this club won the league it was Covid time so everybody is looking forward to Sunday but we know that there is still a job to be done and that's at least one point, said Slot. That's what we know and, hopefully, our fans know as well and they support us in the best possible way they can - like they have all season - and are aware of the fact that we still need a point. We are definitely aware of that. It's a nice game to look forward to but it's also a responsibility we have for Sunday. Tottenham are without a win at Anfield since 2011 and come into the game having lost 18 league games this season and with their primary focus on a Europa League semi-final first-leg against Bodo/Glimt on Thursday. Liverpool have been beaten just twice in the league this season - once at Anfield - and have the best home record in the top flight, having earned 41 points from 16 games. Slot, who has previously won the Dutch title with Feyenoord, is in his first season as Liverpool manager after replacing Klopp last summer. His side have a 12-point advantage over second-placed Arsenal. There have been suggestions that the top flight has not been as competitive as in recent seasons but Slot believes it is a difficult league to win. I've only been here for a year so I can only tell you what I've experienced this season, he said. I think it's never been as exciting for top-four, top-five finish. In all the years before, it was quite clear which clubs will probably get the top three or four positions. In my opinion, it's a really difficult league because that's what I've experienced over here, there's never been an easy game. It's always been very hard to win a game of football. We are not the only team in this league who find it difficult to win a game by three or four goals. That was maybe easier two, three, four or five years ago. Either the teams are not so good any more - the Liverpools, the Manchester Citys and the Arsenals - or we are still very good but the other teams have the funds to spend just as much or, in some situations, even more.",

    "content": "Northern Ireland's Mark Allen made an incredible 147 break but was left one frame away from defeat in the World Championship second round as Chris Wakelin dominated a thrilling session. Allen trailed 10-2 after losing the opening four frames of the morning session on Friday. He went straight to the practice table in the interval and then produced snooker's moment of perfection in the first frame after the restart. It made him only the 11th player to make a 147 at the Crucible. This was the 15th maximum in the main draw stage of the tournament and the first since Mark Selby's clearance in the 2023 final. However, world number 20 Wakelin, who beat former world champion Neil Robertson in round one, was not distracted and secured a 12-4 lead that means he only needs one more frame to move into the quarter-finals when the match resumes at 19:00 BST. The maximum break was Allen's second 147 of the season, having made one during his third-round matchagainst Ben Mertensat the British Open, and the fifth of his career. The achievement earns 39-year-old Allen £45,000 and is the 217th maximum in snooker's history. The cash bonus will be split if another player makes a 147 in the tournament. Seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry, speaking on BBC TV, called the maximum absolutely phenomenal and added: What a performance. Unbelievable. Incredible from Mark Allen. He was 10-2 behind and he's not scored a point for three frames, comes out after the interval and he makes a 147. Coming to the Crucible is always special, but it became even more so for one fan as he pocketed £25,000 thanks to Allen's maximum. One of the event's sponsors, Midnite Sports and Casino, has been running an initiative where for each session of this year's World Championship, one person in the crowd is selected at random and if a 147 happens, on either table, they win £25,000. The lucky prize winner was named as Brian Nicholls from Tamworth, a lifelong snooker fan who had never been to the Crucible before and was bought a ticket by his son as a present for his 75th birthday.",

    "section": "arts",
    "content": "Tragedy Titus Andronicus is the Bard's goriest work, and a new production is set to be one of the most extreme takes on it yet. It raises the question: why do we watch such brutality? Good theatre has the power to really move us – a statement that's usually taken metaphorically, rather than literally. Yet when it comes to Shakespeare's bloodiest play, Titus Andronicus, its impact can be so visceral it causes audience members to faint. I should know: while reviewing a production atShakespeare's Globein London, back in 2014, its disturbingly violent scenes caused me to start to feel light-headed, even while safely sat down in my seat. Unfortunately, it was a bench with no back: before the end of the first half, I had fainted away completely, falling backwards and waking up in a stranger's lap. Warning: this article contains some graphic descriptions of violence And I was far from the only person to have such a full-bodied response to Lucy Bailey's production of this gory revenge tragedy: the press went wild forstories of droppers, with more than 100 people fainting during the run – testament to the immense power of Shakespeare's writing, and the skill of performers, as well as to the props department's handling of litres of fake blood. One of the Bard's earliest plays, written in 1591-2, and almost certainly his first tragedy, Titus Andronicus is a story of violent vengeance: Titus, a general of Rome, returns from wars against the Goths with their queen, Tamora, and her sons held as captives. When her eldest son is sacrificed by Titus, Tamora swears revenge – setting in motion a series of increasingly brutal acts that ends  with an infamous scene involving the baking of pies... Boasting 14 deaths, it is the most violent of all Shakespeare's plays – and now it's back on stage, with a new production opening at the UK's Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon. The play's unavoidable ultra-violence has meant that, for much of the performance history of Shakespeare – whose birthday is today – Titus Andronicus was considered a bit of an embarrassment, a bloody stain on his reputation: too gruesome, too over-the-top, to be considered in the same category of greatness as, say, Hamlet or Othello. Then there's its sometimes queasy tone: the excesses can tip Titus into a gleefully macabre, manic comedy (an aspect also embraced in Bailey's gore-fest). Let's just say, the Victorians were not fans. But the play's reputation began to revive in the second half of the 20th Century. At the Royal Shakespeare Company alone, there have been several seminal productions in the past 70 years, starring Laurence Olivier (1955), Patrick Stewart (1981), Brian Cox (1987) and David Bradley (2003), while Anthony Hopkins playing Titus on screen in Julie Taymor's influential, blackly funny film version in 1999 also surely helped boost the play's standing. Some of these productions leaned heavily on the horror, too: there were fainters and walk-outs in Deborah Warner's unflinching 1987 production, which Coxonce claimedwas the most interesting play he'd done and the best stage performance he'd ever given. But he also pointed to the odd humour of the play, calling it a young man's play… full of energy, joie de vivre and laughter that often strikes people as ludicrous. Titus is notalwaysstaged with grisly literalness: in the Olivier-starring production by Peter Brook, the mutilation of Titus's daughter Lavinia was famously suggested with stylised red streamers – an aestheticised approach also used in the Japanese Ninagawa Company's production in the 2000s. More recently, Jude Christian's all-female 2023 production in London's candle-lit Sam Wanamaker Playhouse enacted the violence on candles themselves, with cast members stabbing, snapping or snuffing them. In the latest production of Titus Andronicus, however, there will be blood. Buckets of it. We are doing gallons of blood. We've made a sort of wet room [on stage], it's got a drainage system and an abattoir hook… says Max Webster, the play's director, over a video call from Stratford-upon-Avon. He's had to figure out how to stage no fewer than 27 different acts of onstage violence, from punches through to limbs being lopped off and tongues being cut out. And the only limit on the amount of gore sloshing around is the practical question of how to clean it up between scenes. It's an unbelievably boring thing about how many crew members and squeegees it takes, laughs Webster. In one sentence, you're thinking 'what is the meaning of tragedy in relation to human nature?' – and then very quickly you get into 'how many mops can the crew hold?'. Webster, whose acclaimed productions include an adaptation of Booker Prize winner Life of Pi and a recent David Tennant-starringMacbeth, wanted to direct Titus Andronicus for one simple reason: Simon Russell Beale, one of Britain's greatest Shakespearean actors, asked him to. Titus was a part that Russell Beale fancied a crack at, and the RSC was happy to oblige. This version is updated – set in a crisp, besuited modern world riven by conflict, although where exactly is kept deliberately vague. It's trying to be open – we're not setting it in Kosovo or Gaza or Sudan, says Webster, adding swiftly And we're not going to try to produce the US army onstage or something – it's trying to make sense of Rome as a 'superpower of empire' rather than as 'the United States of America'. Still, he sees Titus as freshly, troublingly relevant, in light of shocking events such as the 7 October Hamas attacks, the war in Gaza, and the sudden invasion of Russian troops into Ukraine, the story's extreme violence doesn't seem so unimaginable. In this production, the violence is certainly no laughing matter. In rehearsals, they have been playing it entirely seriously, and eschewing the blackly cartoonish or stylishly Tarantino-esque approach to the violence that some directors explore. This has risks: Webster fully expects that, when the show is in front of an audience, there may be some nervous laughter; it'll be their job in previews to figure out where these laughs form a necessary pressure release valve, and where they're really just a sign to make the show even more harrowing. For Webster, it isn't possible to laugh at the brutality of Titus Andronicus in 2025 – it's too real. He sees the play as a howl of pain; watching it becomes an act of witness, an attempt to face up to atrocities taking place right now – something that he acknowledges could be hard for an audience. I can walk down the Avon [river], and know my family is safe and it doesn't feel like the world is burning. But you look at other parts of the world… these horrors, that maybe feel historical to us, are actually happening. But Titus Andronicus isn't a documentary; it's an old play, that people choose to stage and choose to pay to go to see. So why, when we could just watch the news, do we opt to watch such harrowing content as art, as entertainment? It's a question that partly motivated Russell Beale to do Titus,he told The Guardianlast week: I don't understand the violence. I don't understand why as an audience we feel excited, stimulated, challenged by it; it's so relentless. It may have been shunned in later centuries, but Titus Andronicus's original audiences loved it – and many other forms of graphically horrible entertainment, from bear baiting to public hangings. Titus was a hit in Elizabethan England, and in writing it Shakespeare may, in fact, have been playing to the crowd: it resembles the super-violent revenge tragedies that were popular at the time, rarely-staged works such as Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy and Thomas Middleton's The Revenger's Tragedy. Such plays were, themselves, drawing inspiration from the incredibly bloody and outrageous tragedies written by Seneca in the First Century AD – including Thyestes, a source of direct inspiration for Shakespeare, where the title character is fed a pie made of the flesh of his own children. And obviously, Ancient Greek tragedies – even if they keep acts of violence off-stage – are a rich and enduring source of creative murders of family members and cycles of bloody revenge. Such tragedies, Webster points out, had their origins in ritual performances of sacrifice. I guess theatre came out of killing goats in Ancient Greece… there's always been some relationship between theatre and violence and the sacred stuff. More like this: •Edward II: Did a gay love affair spark a royal crisis? •The Shakespeare words you don't know you know •The Shakespeare tragedy that speaks to us now It does seem that watching the very worst things imaginable unfolding has an irresistible appeal – not only do we still return to Greek or Shakespearean tragedies, but we've also turned death and violence into major sources of entertainment, apparently appropriate for daily consumption. Horror films, true crime podcasts, police procedurals, first-person shooter video games… depictions of very, very bad things happening to bodies are pervasive across all art forms, all the time. You might even say we're addicted to the adrenaline shot we get from such emotionally-wringing, extreme forms of entertainment:research showsthat the blood-pumping, heart-racing high we get from fear is close to the pleasurable bodily experience of excitement. From the high body count of fantasy shows likeGame of ThronesandHouse of the Dragonto the dystopian chills ofSquid Gameto the seemingly endless appetite for the torture porn movies of the Saw franchise, much of our creative output would make Seneca smack his lips in approval. But beyond the potential physical thrills, why are we so drawn to watching such violent content? When I ask Webster, he's as unsure as Russell Beale. The truth is, I don't know. But thereisa lust to watch violence on-stage – it is a basic human urge. He wonders if it forms a safe outlet for our innate human darkness. And a common theory as to why we enjoy the terrors of a horror movie or the bleakness of a dystopian novel is just this: that such fictional outings are a secure way for us to rehearse terrible acts – without ever having to experience those in real life. Maybe it is so we don't have to do [violence] in our lives? Webster ponders. We all have these weird, dark, turbulent fantasies that we don't talk about because they're not socially acceptable… so maybe seeing it on-stage is an escape, or a relief? The academics Haiyang Yang and Kuangjie Zhang confirm Webster's theory, sharing research in theHarvard Business Reviewthat found that horror entertainment may help us (safely) satisfy our curiosity about the dark side of human psyche… As an inherently curious species, many of us are fascinated by what our own kind is capable of. Observing storylines in which actors must confront the worst parts of themselves serves as a pseudo character study of the darkest parts of the human condition. If I'm honest, the news that there's so much blood in Webster's Titus Andronicus that they need a drain on stage has got me nervous of watching the show, rather than gleefully ready to excise my inner demons. Is he worried that this Titus might be so powerful – so bloody, and so upsetting – that people will faint? He is not. It's important you provide a content warning, and then people can make an informed decision about if they want to see it, says Webster. If people faint, they faint.

    "title": "Why this iconic 1839 painting is not what it seems",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250415-jmw-turner-at-250-why-his-greatest-painting-the-fighting-temeraire-is-so-misunderstood",
    "section": "arts",
    "content": "As museums around the world celebrate the 250th birthday of JMW Turner, it's time to reappraise his beloved and celebrated painting, The Fighting Temeraire. JMW Turner's The Fighting Temeraire became a national celebrity when it was first unveiled in 1839, and its fame has endured to the present day. It was once votedBritain's favourite paintingand currently features on£20 banknotes. But the widely accepted interpretation of this iconic painting's message might, in fact, contradict Turner's true intentions. The Temeraire of the title refers to a 98-gun warship of the British Navy, which is depicted in the painting's background. It was a hero in Britain's defence against France during the Napoleonic Wars, but it caught the nation's attention in 1838 when it was dismantled and its parts sold off. Turner's painting depicts this once-mighty gladiator of the seas being towed down a burnished River Thames by a much more recently invented steam-powered tugboat. A brief segment in the 2012 James Bond filmSkyfallcaptures a popular view about the painting. In the scene, Bond (Daniel Craig) meets Q (Ben Whishaw), his new head of research and development, in London's National Gallery, and they sit in front of The Fighting Temeraire. It always makes me feel a little melancholy, says the young, tech-savvy Q, in a pointed jibe to 007, an old-school field agent. A grand old warship being ignominiously hauled away for scrap. This echoes the widely held belief that the painting evokes a sense of nostalgia and faded national glory. According to this view, the ghostly Temeraire is the painting's heroine, and the tugboat its villain. In the 19th Century, the English writer William Makepeace Thackeray referred to the smaller vessel as a little, spiteful, diabolical steamer and the American novelist Herman Melville called it a pygmy steam-tug by comparison to the Titan Temeraire. You can see why Turner's original audience may have sympathised with the humbled HMS Temeraire and been saddened by her fate. Back in 1804, she had played a critical role in blockading French ports and defending the British coast. But her finest moment came on the afternoon of 21 October 1805, in the Atlantic Ocean, just off the coast of south-west Spain. At this pivotal hour, the Battle of Trafalgar, a deadly sea battle between the British Royal Navy and the combined fleets of Spain and France, was at its climax. Admiral Lord Nelson's flagship HMS Victory had led the attack but was being pummelled by the French vessel Redoubtable. Then, out of the cannon smoke, surged HMS Temeraire, followed by a war-hungry flotilla of British vessels. The Temeraire blasted the Redoubtable with her guns and endured a hailstorm of cannon volleys in return – an onslaught that lacerated the ship and spattered her decks with blood. But like a stalwart prize-fighter, the Temeraire weathered the bout. She valiantly protected her flagship and played a vital part in the British navy's ultimate victory in the Battle of Trafalgar. Turner was 64 when he painted The Fighting Temeraire. He was born in 1775 in a down-at-heel area of London near Covent Garden but managed to enrol at the prestigious Royal Academy of Arts aged 14. He became an Academician at the precocious age of 24, and a Professor of Perspective when he was just 32. But although he rubbed shoulders with the great and the good, he refused to soften his Cockney accent or refine his manners. He was also fiercely entrepreneurial – he opened his own private gallery, sought wealthy patrons, and was always on the lookout for captivating and lucrative new artistic projects that might have widespread appeal. On one level, The Fighting Temeraire achieves his desire for broad popularity by harnessing people's sense of national pride. But there's an even more important message to learn from the painting than its patriotism and sentimentality. It concerns that much maligned tugboat: the true focal point of the painting. Steam power was the new mechanical wonder of Turner's age, and his attitude to this recent technology was much more complicated than Thackeray, Melville or Q recognised. In other Turner artworks, like Snow Storm – Steam-Boat (1842) and Rain, Steam and Speed (1844), you can see his fascination with modern machinery and its transformative influence on individual experience, the environment, and society as a whole. This is in stark contrast with Turner's great rival John Constable, whose parents were from the elite, and whose paintings tended to overlooksome of the most seismic changesthat were reshaping the British Isles at the time. In Constable's iconic 1821 painting The Hay Wain, an archaic cart rolls gently away from the viewer into a bucolic English landscape. Turner's The Fighting Temeraire gives us the exact opposite, putting the spectator on a collision course with the unstoppable force of industry. This reflected contemporary reality. At the time The Fighting Temeraire was painted, the Royal Navy was increasingly using steamboats for towing bigger vessels. Moves were already afoot to replace its sail-powered fleet with new steam frigates. But the demise of the Temeraire didn't reflect a routine upgrade in armaments. This was a one-of-a-kind revolution in seafaring. Sailors around the world had relied on wind-and-sail or oar-propulsion for thousands of years. Now, steam engines could allow seafarers to overcome the vagaries of gusts, shallows and tidal patterns – to supersede nature itself. The future was steam-powered, but how this was going to affect the future of transport, trade and naval combat was still anybody's guess in the 1830s. What Turner did know was that as far back asHomer's Odyssey, sailing functioned as a profound symbol of the life journey in art and literature. And so, by hitching the old and the new so unforgettably in his painting, he shows us a compelling metamorphosis – the beginning of a new, post-industrial lifecycle in human history. Turner was awake to the responsibility of artists in times of irreversible historical change. For him, the age-old skill of depicting wooden sailing ships, their rigging, sails and ornately carved figureheads was becoming obsolete. The challenge for every artist (and every member of society) in the modern age, he realised, was to discover beauty and significance in newness, and in artefacts that had not previously been depicted in art, like iron funnels, pistons, valves, and paddle wheels. In The Fighting Temeraire, his rise to this challenge is captured in a very memorable and uncompromising symbol. More like this: •The forgotten Monet finally getting her moment •The schmaltzy paintings that divided the US •The surprising story of Van Gogh's guardian angel Turner even adapted his painting technique to express the technological and social transformations in the world around him. He used newly invented paint hues like Lemon Yellow and Scarlet Lake in The Fighting Temeraire. Pigment analysis of the painting also indicates that he raided from his kitchen for substances to add his paint to achieve desired effects, like tallow, cooking fat or even salad oil. His interest in new technology, and his search for innovative techniques with which to represent them, had a direct impact on the next generation of avant-garde painters. Claude Monet and Camille Pissarro were both wowed by Turner's art. An engraving of Turner's Rain, Steam and Speed (which depicts a train hurtling over Maidenhead bridge) was even displayed atthe first Impressionist Exhibition in Paris in 1874– a pivotal event in the history of modern art. In 2025 various exhibitions will celebrate the 250th anniversary of Turner's birth, from Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool (Turner: Always Contemporary), to Turner's House in Twickenham (Turner's Kingdom: Beauty, Birds and Beasts), and from the Yale Centre for British Art, Connecticut (JMW Turner: Romance and Reality) to Tate Britain (Turner and Constable). But to fully appreciate this extraordinary artist, it's important to grasp the true meaning of his masterpiece, The Fighting Temeraire. Frequently it's been accepted as a melancholy image, a forlorn lament for past glories and a lost way of life. But this misses its essential point. The Fighting Temeraire is really about transformation and the inevitability of change rather than nostalgia. The most important lessons to learn from The Fighting Temeraire are about Turner's attitude and outlook. It embodies his refusal to be daunted by newness or enslaved by traditional artistic values.

    "content": "Sam was lying in bed one morning when her tenant in a house she owned in Margate sent her a photo of a piece of graffiti that had appeared on the wall outside. Astonishingly, it looked like a Banksy. It would turn out to be perhaps the graffiti artist's most interesting new artwork of recent years, Valentine's Day Mascara (pictured above), which was revealed in Margate on Valentine's Day, 2023. Bamboozled, Sam googled: what do you do when you wake up with a Banksy on your wall? What did Google say about that? I asked her. Nothing! And I was like, I need to contact the council, I need to find an art gallery who can advise me. Sam called Julian Usher at Red Eight Gallery. Julian's team, conscious that new Banksys are under immediate threat from street cleaners, the weather, rival graffiti artists and other art dealers, promised he'd be in Margate within the hour: We knew we had to get the piece covered, say Julian. And there was another reason Julian got to Margate double-quick: if Banksy chooses your wall for one of his drawings, you could be seriously in the money. For the second season of myBBC Radio 4 podcast The Banksy Story, which is called When Banksy Comes To Town, I've been following the very different fates of two sets of homeowners who wake up one day to find a Banksy on their wall. The season shows just how important his graffiti becomes for a local community – and why people disagree so vehemently about what should happen after it's discovered. Sam became the custodian of Valentine's Day Mascara, which speaks to the theme of domestic violence, incidents of which usually spike each Valentine's Day. It's a complicated bit of work. A peppy 50s housewife with a black eye has bludgeoned her partner. A real pan with flecks of red is at her feet, and his painted legs are upended into the real fridge-freezer that Banksy left by the wall. A broken plastic chair testifies to the fight they have had. Later on the day it appeared, refuse collectors arrived to spirit away the fridge-freezer. This precipitated a free-for-all, with the public helping themselves to the remnants. It was mayhem. A media scrum, a wrong-footed local council, millions of global onlookers. Exactly, one suspects, what Banksy wanted. And this time, just for laughs, he left behind oil painter Peter Brown, commissioned to capture the scenes he would miss. I spoke to Pete The Street Brown for my series. The whole reason I was employed was because Banksy was questioning what was the art about, Pete explained. Is it about the graffiti? Or is it about the reaction afterwards, and what happens to it? As luck would have it, Pete was captured on video just as Banksy's team were putting the finishing touches to Valentine's Day Mascara – a video that The Banksy Story managed to obtain. In it we can see that one of Banksy's team let a local kid play with their drone. They're in the process of putting a large piece on a wall and yet they're taking the time to teach a kid how to fly a drone, says Steph Warren, who used to work with Banksy and who appeared in my first series - about the artist's rise and rise. Very sweet! Alongside Sam, I've been following the story of Gert and Gary. They, like Sam, did not want me to use their last name. A 30ft-high seagull appeared one morning on the wall of their buy-to-let in Lowestoft in Suffolk. The bird needed to be massive for Banksy's ambitious visual gag to work. The artist had shoved large yellow insulation strips into a skip that now looked like a fast-food container that the seagull divebombed to steal chips. Banksy had chosen his wall well. Visitors arriving by train were treated to this witty meditation on the scourge of Britain's seaside towns, equal parts warning and celebration. The Lowestoft Seagull was part of Banksy's Great British Staycation, his post-Covid lockdown campaign to cheer us all up at the prospect of a summer holiday spent in the UK. But Gert was not cheered-up at all. It's not a seagull, it's an albatross! she quipped when I went to interview her. How did you know it was a Banksy? I asked. There was scaffolding erected on the side of the house. I tried to find out if it was a particular scaffolding firm, but there was no phone number, Gert replied. On the Monday morning the letting agency informed me that I could possibly have a Banksy. By then the scaffolding had gone and this seagull appeared. This fits with what we know of Banksy's modus operandi. He claims hiding in plain sight is the best way to remain invisible. If questioned about your legitimacy, he wrote in his book Wall & Piece, simply complain about the hourly rate. It's a good gag. But how fun is it for the folk on the other end of his spray can? I found that with good hustling skills a Banksied homeowner might see their bank balance expanded, but it's not an easy process. As Gert explains, exasperated, Lowestoft people commented that it belongs to Lowestoft… But nobody's turned up to say, 'we'll help you protect it'. It doesn't belong to the person filming it, or the person taking pictures with their children. The problem is mine! Gert had to contend with people putting their children into the skip for photo opportunities, the council trying to charge her for Perspex screens, and the threat of a Preservation Order which might have cost her £40,000 a year. And the two stories I've been following have ended up having entirely different outcomes. Both artworks have been taken off the houses they were painted on – a complex, expensive operation that uses specialist equipment – so they can be sold. But while the Banksy in Margate is now on the verge of selling for well over £1m, with a sizeable chunk set to go to a domestic violence charity, and with the piece remaining in the town for the foreseeable future, the Banksy up the coast in Lowestoft languishes in a climate-controlled warehouse, costing its owners £3,000 per month. It has cost Gert and her partner Gary around £450,000 so far to preserve the piece and although there are buyers sniffing around, nobody has bought it yet. Speaking about the situation, Gary told me: I'm so angry at what's going on. Not everyone approves of people trying to sell Banksy's street art. Steph Warren – who starred in the first series of The Banksy Story as the only person ever to work for Banksy without signing his non-disclosure agreement – suggests that worried homeowners should simply get busy with five litres of white emulsion and paint it out. Owner of street-art gallery Stelladore in St Leonards, Warren is a purist, who feels that art made for the street should remain there, no matter its value. With Banksy, where he puts the art is fundamental, she says. Remove the work from the precise place on the streets that he put it, and the work instantly loses its power. Context is everything. But Banksy has elevated graffiti into a new art form, now monetised – street art. Banksy's signed prints can sell for six-figure sums. Graffiti, or street art, has not just come of age, it is now an asset class. Given this, how can any homeowner feel okay about scrubbing away a Banksy without feeling as if they have smashed a Ming vase? One thing I know for sure: if you wake up with a Banksy on your wall, you'll have to make a series of clever decisions to come out of it unscathed. As Sam says, after two years of dealing with the Banksy circus, going back to normal life now is going to be terribly boring.",

    "content": "Disney's stage version of their hit film is an unmatched global phenomenon. Twenty-seven years on from its premiere, its director discusses why it was a big risk that paid off 10 billion-fold. The Lion King musical is a beast of a show – captivating US audiences since 1997, it is the highest-grossing production of all time, in theatreorin film, taking over $10 billion (£7.68 billion) worldwide. It's currently celebrating 25 years in the West End, hits 27 years on Broadway next month, and has been staged all around the world – from South Africa to South Korea, Australia to the United Arab Emirates – visiting every continent except Antarctica. The penguins don't need us, quips Julie Taymor, the theatre, film and opera director and designer whose unique vision helped the musical spring into life on stage – proving that theatrical versions of Disney movies could not only be hugely profitable, but could do so while being artistically inventive in their own right. Warning: This article contains language that some may find offensive But when Disney initially approached her about directing a live version of their adored 1994 cartoon film, Taymor didn't know what to say: she hadn't actually seen The Lion King. I thought, well, why not, let's go look at the movie, the still youthful-looking 71-year-old recalls, speaking to me via Zoom from the US. And I was really taken; I loved it. The challenge of adapting an epic, wide-screen story excited her: how, she recalls wondering, would you put hundreds of animals on stage? How could you create a stampede of wildebeest live in front of an audience? The answer was by embracing a distinctly theatrical approach: The Lion King uses masks and puppetry to put the animals of the African savannah onstage, and to tell the coming-of-age story of Simba the lion, from cub to king. Taymor designed all the costumes and masks, and the breakthrough moment was deciding to let the audience see the mechanics of how each character is made – to invite them to suspend their disbelief, and to use their imagination in helping create that whole world onstage. I went through every animal: okay, we've got a giraffe, I'll put the neck on top of the head of the dancer, but you're going to see the dancer's face, you're going to see where the stilts are wrapped to the dancer's hands… remembers Taymor gleefully. There is no attempt to hide the human being behind the masks or inside the puppet, she says, a technique she dubbed the double event, allowing performers to be both animal and human simultaneously. So you can see Simba's emotion on the actor's face, while a mask on top of his head reminds the audience that this is, in fact, a lion; Timon the meerkat is a puppet, drawing on the Japanese Bunraku puppetry tradition where you can fully see the person behind him, controlling his movements. Trays of grasses on performers' heads evoke swaying grasslands, while whole flocks of gazelles are created by a chorus wearing puppets on their heads and arms at the same time. I wanted to do what theatre does best,” recalls Taymor. Film hides the strings: we know it's fake, but we're pretending that it's really there – that the Titanic is really on the ocean, that it's really sinking. Whereas in the theatre, we will enjoy seeing a little puppet of a boat, and a big ocean of silk… this is the power of theatre. The audience is not played down to – they're brought into the game. Today, it's hard to imagine The Lion King being done any other way – but it wasn't all smooth sailing. And even getting the call from Disney was a surprise to start: while Taymor had already made a name for herself within theatrical circles – her musical fable about a jaguar cub who transforms into a boy in the Uruguay jungle, Juan Darién, had netted five Tony nominations in 1996. But aside from that big cat connection, her work's distinctly international flavour and its heavy use of masks and puppetry inspired by Indonesian and Japanese traditions didn't necessarily scream family-friendly commercial juggernaut. Nonetheless, Thomas Schumacher, the new head of Disney Theatricals, had a hunch Taymor's highly visual style of theatre could be just the thing to bring The Lion King to the stage. It wasn't the first live Disney musical – that was Beauty and the Beast, also a commercial success, running on Broadway for 13 years. But it didn't win much love from theatre critics; Variety was not unusually harsh in dubbing it bloated, padded, gimmick-ridden, tacky and, despite the millions, utterly devoid of imagination. It was widely seen as a cash-in – more like an extension of Disneyland than an imaginative piece of art in its own right. It would be a very different story with The Lion King – which the New York Times immediately praised on its 1997 world premiere as beingmiles away from standard Disney fare. Yet Taymor recalls that, from the very beginning, the head honchos at Disney were remarkably open to whatever ideas she cooked up. They didn't actually have a very strong idea at all about how to do this, which was quite great – it left the door wide open. The door was so wide, in fact, that they weren't even sure The Lion King would be a Broadway musical; as Taymor recalls, early discussions kicked around the idea of a stadium show, or something at a planetarium. But Taymor does recall how an early workshop showcasing the double event mask concept spooked some of the money men. Michael Eisner, Disney's chief executive, Joe Roth, the studio chief, and what Taymor describes as a bunch of the top people at Disney – but not theatre people all came to see what she was cooking up. But the masks were too big; the costumes were unfinished; one of the puppeteers seemed determined to upstage his own puppet… I got major doubt from the movie guys, admits Taymor. Her response was: OK, let's do a test – because I don't want doubt, and I have nothing to sell. If you don't think the puppetry and the double event masks are right, we'll do something else. She put together three different, fully realised visions for The Lion King: a commedia dell'arte approach, with half masks that were smaller and more human; aCats-style version, with face-paint, and her double event approach, with the masks on the head. All three worked, says Taymor. So I said to Michael Eisner 'which one do you want?' He said 'let's go with your original concept. It's risky, but the bigger the risk, the bigger the payoff.' It was a leap of faith that surely helped the musical become the success it is – and surely also helped pave the way for other puppet-starring theatrical hits, from War Horse to Life of Pi, Encores!'s recent Broadway revival of Into the Woods or the Royal Shakespeare Company's new stage version of Studio Ghibli hit My Neighbour Totoro. The Lion King musical may be most famous for its visual style, but Taymor's journey started not with the look of the piece, but with the story, which she worked on with writers Roger Allers and Irene Mecchi. A brisk 88-minutes long, the movie needed to be expanded, Taymor felt, to sustain a two-act musical. At one point in the development process, she came up with a whole new, high-concept second half, where Simba ended up in a Las Vegas style city in the desert. It was very Broadway – there was a pussycat lounge with all these lionesses and lounge lizards, and a jaguar who is a car… Simba becomes a boxer, and is made into the lion king. It was really kind of crazy, and Tom [Schumacher]'s mouth just dropped open. Disney may not have known what they wanted – but they knew they didn't wantthat.In the end, the musical follows the film's story closely, although Simba's years in the wilderness with Timon and Pumbaa are expanded, with the young lion having to rescue his friends from a waterfall. Taymor says she was inspired by various archetypal coming-of-age and prodigal-son narratives. If the hero is going to go and then come back as the lion king, what does he have to experience to earn that right? More like this •The Swinging 60s icon who revolutionised style •The 'gay Clueless' that became a cult classic •The cult 90s show that changed TV forever Then there was also some urgent work to be done on the female characters. The female characters were not profound or deep in the original, so I said 'we gotta change this', remembers Taymor. Rafiki, the baboon, became more central to the story as a female shaman or Sangoma, while Simba's love interest Nala is given more  focus, stage time, and more agency. Another eureka moment along the way came with the music. Obviously, Elton John's soundtrack to the animation features some of the catchiest Disney songs ever (The Circle of Life, Hakuna Matata, Can You Feel the Love Tonight?). But, beloved as they are, there were not enough of them for a whole show. The film also featured music by South African composer Lebo M, who along with Hans Zimmer released a record called Rhythm of the Pride Lands in 1995, featuring more traditionally South African music sung in languages such as Xhosa, Swahili, Sotho and Zulu. When Schumacher gave this record to Taymor, the choral nature of the singing unlocked something in her imagination: Now I had my population – I had the possibility to have a chorus of birds singing, a chorus of zebras dancing! This was very thrilling. Lebo M was brought into the project, and provided several more new songs for the show. Lebo became an equal composer to Elton, and brought that other side – the African spiritual side – to the music, in songs like They Live in You, Shadowlands… These are very important to the musical of The Lion King. Showcasing African languages and choral singing styles in the show wasn't really for political reasons, says Taymor, it was more that it was beautiful. It was moving. It sounded great. But it did have an impact on casting, with Taymor stipulating that The Lion King should have a predominantly African-American or African cast, with only the fools (Timon and Pumbaa; Zazu) or the villain (Scar) played by white actors. Andthatin turn has had a notable knock-on effect in providing opportunities for several generations of non-white performers, helping diversify the world of commercial musicals. There's no doubt that The Lion King, 27 years ago in America, and 25 years ago in London, was doing something very few other musicals had done – it wasn't about race, but it brought in the talent of this huge pool of actors that weren't necessarily going to be used in the white musicals at the time. We all feel very proud about that. Nonetheless, Taymor is still a white American woman telling a story set in Africa, through a fusion of styles that draws on many different performance traditions, from Japanese puppetry to African masks. If it was made today, there might well be questions about cultural appropriation. Taymor would refute any such accusations. When you just lift up a style of theatre and plunk it down… maybe you can say that's inappropriate. But inspiration, techniques, and styles have [always] criss-crossed across the planet. She is keen to point out that there is absolutely zero Japanese Bunraku puppetry or Balinese shadow puppetry in The Lion King – there are only techniquesinspiredby those traditions. We borrow. It's the beauty of what we share as humans. And Taymor was fully immersed in exploring such techniques from the very start of her career: after college, she had a fellowship to study theatre in Eastern Europe, Indonesia and Japan. She intended to be in Indonesia for three months – and stayed for four years. It changed my life, she says. As an artist, I was born there. I was lucky to be in Java and Bali before the onslaught of tourism, and saw a culture where theatre was the most powerful form of entertainment and education. It was the most fundamental thing that you could participate in. At just 21, she set up her own theatre company there and worked with Sumatran, Balinese and Javanese mask dancers, actors, puppeteers and musicians to create and tour her own shows – productions she'd eventually bring to Western audiences, too. Broadway can be a cruel mistress – as Taymor would later discover with the ill-fated Spider-Man musical,Turn Off the Dark. If The Lion King was the Broadway dream, Spider-Man was the ultimate nightmare: a stunt and tech-heavy show with music by Bono and The Edge, it went wildly over-budget and its opening was much-delayed, with several performers injured in previews. It also became mired in artistic differences that saw Taymor replaced as director; she later ended up in a legal battle with the producers over royalties that wassettled out of court. Such extreme triumphs or disasters are pretty rare – but you can never really tell if a show has got that special magic until it's in front of an audience. Still, when it came to The Lion King, Taymor remembers a sense that something specialwashappening during rehearsals. We had the puppet room, the choreography room, my main rehearsal room… during our breaks, I'd wander into the choreography rooms and my mouth would drop. Or I'd wander into the puppet workshop and see how they were bringing them to life. Or they would all come into my room and say, 'holy shit, look at the giraffes'. We were our own audience, and we got excited. The show continues to excite audiences today – well over a hundred million people have seen The Lion King. But the first real moment Taymor got an inkling of just how successful the musical might be was at its first performance. The production has always opened with the cast of animals coming in through the auditorium – zebras, cheetahs, gazelles and giraffes moving down the aisle and through the audience. It's a famous element of the show now, but it took early audiences by surprise, in the very best way. In the first performance, people were screaming when the animals came down the aisle – we didn't expect that. We were so overwhelmed by the audience reaction, we just started crying, Taymor recalls. They had a hit – and a new kind of musical was born.

    "content": "The recent discovery of an art forger's workshop reminds us of the long history of fraudulent artworks – here are the simple rules to work them out. It's everywhere: fake news, deep fakes, identity fraud. So ensnared are we in a culture of digitised deceptions, a phenomenon increasingly augmentedby artificial intelligence, it would be easy to think that deceit itself is a high-tech invention of the cyber age. Recent revelations however – from the discovery of an elaborate, if decidedly low-tech,art forger's workshop in Rometo the sensational allegation that a cherished Baroque masterpiece in London's National Gallery isa crude simulacrum of a lost original– remind us that duplicity in the world of art has a long and storied history, one written not in binary ones and zeroes, but in impossible pigments, clumsy brushstrokes and suspicious signatures. When it comes to falsification and phoniness, there is indeed no new thing under the Sun. On 19 February, Italy's Carabinieri Command for the Protection of Cultural Heritage uncovered a covert forgery operation in a northern district of Rome. Authorities confiscated more than 70 fraudulent artworks falsely attributed to notable artists from Pissarro to Picasso, Rembrandt to Dora Maar, along with materials used to mimic vintage canvases, artist signatures, and the stamps of galleries no longer in operation. The suspect, who has yet to be apprehended, is thought to have used online platforms such as Catawiki and eBay to hawk their phoney wares, deceiving potential buyers with convincing certificates of authenticity that they likewise contrived. News of the clandestine lab's discovery was quickly followed by publicity for a new book, due for release this week, alleging that one of The National Gallery's highlights is not at all what it seems. According to artist and historian Euphrosyne Doxiadis, author of NG6461: The Fake National Gallery Rubens, the painting Samson and Delilah – a large oil-on-wood attributed to the 17th Century Flemish master Peter Paul Rubens and purchased by the London museum in 1980 for £2.5m (thenthe second-highest price ever paid for a painting at auction) – is three centuries younger than the date of 1609-10 that sits beside it on the gallery wall and is incalculably less accomplished than the museum believes. Doxiadis's conclusion corroborates one reached in 2021 by the Swiss company, Art Recognition, which determined, through the use of AI, that there was a 91% probability that Samson and Delilah is the work of someone other than Rubens. Her assertion that the brushwork we see in the painting is crass and wholly inconsistent with the fluid flow of the Flemish master's hand is strongly contested by The National Gallery, which stands by its attribution. Samson and Delilah has long been accepted by leading Rubens scholars as a masterpiece by Peter Paul Rubens, it said in a statement given to the BBC. Painted on wood panel in oil shortly after his return to Antwerp in 1608 and demonstrating all that the artist had learned in Italy, it is a work of the highest aesthetic quality. A technical examination of the picture was presented in an article in The National Gallery's Technical Bulletin in 1983. The findings remain valid. The divergence of opinion between the museum's experts and those who doubt the work's authenticity opens a curious space in which to reflect on intriguing questions of artistic value and merit. Is there ever legitimacy in forgery? Can fakes be masterpieces? As more sophisticated tools of analysis are applied to paintings and drawings whose legitimacy has long been in question (including several works attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, such as the hotly disputed chalk and ink drawingLa Bella Principessa), as well as those whose validity has never been in doubt, debates about the integrity of cultural icons are only likely to accelerate. What follows are a handful of handy principles to keep in mind when navigating the impending controversies – five simple rules for spotting a fake masterpiece. To be a successful art forger requires more than technical proficiency and a misplaced ethical compass. It isn't enough to approximate the dibby-dabby dots of a Georges Seurat, say, or the thick expressive swirls of Vincent van Gogh. You need to know your history as well as your chemistry. Anachronistic pigments will give you away every time and were the downfall ofGerman art forger Wolfgang Beltracchi and his wife Helene, who succeeded in selling makeshift modernist masterpieces for millions before a careless squeeze of prefab paint onto their audacious palettes in 2006 sealed their fate. Beltracchi, whose modus operandi was to create new works by everyone from Max Ernst to André Derain, rather than recreate lost ones, was always careful to mix his own paints to ensure they contained only ingredients available to whomever he was attempting to impersonate. He only slipped up once. And that was enough. Fabricating a wonky Der Blaue Reiter-ish red landscape of jigsawed horses that he attributed to the German Expressionist Heinrich Campendonk, Beltracchi reached for a readymade tube of paint, which he hadn't realised contained a pinch of titanium white – a relatively new pigment to which Campendonk would not have had access. It was all investigators would need to prove the work, which had sold for €2.8m, was a fake. Beltracchi was unlucky. The gap between titanium white's availability and its potential use by Campendonk was only a few years. On occasion, the divide is shockingly wide. Analysis of a Portrait of Saint Jerome, once attributed to the Italian master Parmigianino andsold by Sotheby's auction house in 2012 for $842,500, exposed the prevalence throughout the work of phthalocyanine green, a synthetic pigment invented in 1935, four centuries after the 16th-Century Renaissance artist worked. Artists may be visionaries, but they're not time travellers. It is uplifting to believe that one's value, as a person, is not tethered to the past. Not so with art. A painting, sculpture, or drawing without a heavy history is not, alas, more inspiring for its lack of baggage. It is suspicious. Or rather, it should be. All too often, greed can interfere in the clear-sightedness of assessing the authenticity of a painting or sculpture. Things have histories we want them to have. That was certainly the case with a succession of phoney Vermeers that issued from the workshop of a Dutch portraitist, Han van Meegeren – one of the most prolific and successful forgers of the 20th Century. Desperate to believe that the miraculous appearance of canvases, including a depiction of Christ and The Men at Emmaus, might be lost masterpieces from the same hand that madeGirl with a Pearl Earringand The Milkmaid, collectors were blind to the glaring absence of any trace of the paintings' provenance – their prior ownership, exhibition history, and proof of sales. Everyone was fooled. In authenticating the painting in the Burlington Magazine, one expert insisted in no other picture by the great Master of Delft do we find such sentiment, such a profound understanding of the Bible story – a sentiment so nobly human expressed through the medium of the highest art. But it was all a lie. In a remarkable twist, Van Meegeren eventually chose to expose himself as a fraudster shortly after the end of World War Two, after being charged by Dutch authorities with the crime of selling a Vermeer – therefore a national treasure – to the Nazi official Hermann Göring. To prove his innocence, if innocence it might be called, and demonstrate that he had merely sold a worthless fake of his own forging, not a real Old Master, Van Meegeren performed the extraordinary feat of whisking up a fresh masterpiece from thin air before the experts' astonished eyes. Voilà, Vermeer. More recently, in a 2017 episode of BBC's popular arts programme Fake or Fortune?, presenter Philip Mould's long-held hunch that a painting he once sold for £35,000 was really a priceless original by the English Romantic artist John Constable – an alternative, and previously undocumented, view of the landscape artist's 1821 masterpieceThe Hay Wain– was dramatically confirmed after Mould and fellow presenter Fiona Bruce excavated long-buried financial records. Having traced the painting's ownership back to a sale by the artist's son, the team recalculated the canvass true value to be £2m, proving that some pasts are worth hanging onto. Artists' gestures – their simultaneously studied and instinctive brushwork and draughtsmanship – are nothing less than fingerprints writ large across canvases and works on paper. One artist's lightness of touch and another's sturdiness of stroke are exceedingly tricky to falsify, especially if you are conscious that every twitch of your brush and jot of your pen will be scrutinised by suspicious eyes and cutting-edge equipment. Pressure under pressure is hard to maintain, an obstacle that the British forger Eric Hebborn (who died under suspicious circumstancesin Rome in 1996 after a career spent counterfeiting more than 1,000 works attributed to everyone from Mantegna to Tiepolo, Poussin to Piranesi)overcame with alcohol. By all accounts, brandy was Hebborn's tipple of choice for calming his rattling nerves. It allowed him to inhabit, without inhibition, the mind and muscle of whichever old master he was channelling. Whereas fakes from the hands of Beltracchi and Van Meegeren have since been found under closer inspection to be riddled with incoherent gestures, the fluidity of drawings falsified by the tipsy Hebborn in his heyday in the 1970s and 80s continues to confound the experts. To this day, institutions that possess works that passed through his hands refuse to accept they are all fakes, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art's pen and ink drawing View of the Temples of Venus and of Diana in Baia from the South, a work it still insists is from the circle of Jan Brueghel the Elder.What do you think? When the analysis of pigments, provenance, and paintbrush pressure still leaves you stumped, it may be necessary to dive a little deeper. For 20 years since the 1990s, the authenticity of a still life purportedly by Vincent van Gogh was serially confirmed and refuted by experts. To some, the garish reds and submarine blues that echoed eerily from the bouquet of roses, daisies, and wildflowers didn't have the ring of truth and seemed at odds with the painter's palette. The absence of any ownership record for the painting didn't help. But an X-ray undertaken in 2012 put questions to rest when it revealed that the artist, pinching pennies, reused a canvas on which he had created another image entirely – one to which he makes explicit reference in a letter from January 1886. This week, Van Gogh remarked to his brother Theo, I painted a large thing with two nude torsos – two wrestlers… and I really like doing that. As if proleptically anticipating the ensuing scholarly wrangle over the work's authenticity that the painting would in time trigger, the static tussle of the two athletes, trapped beneath paint for over a century, not only rescued the work from unfair allegations of illegitimacy, it created a kind of fresh composite painting, a vivid compression – a freeze frame of a restless mind forever scuffling with itself, desperate to survive. As a final safeguard in authenticating a work of art, run the spell check. Doing sowould have saved the collector Pierre Lagrange $17m– the price he paid in 2007 for an otherwise compelling forgery of a small 12x18in (30x46cm) painting falsely attributed to the American Abstract Expressionist Jackson Pollock. Famous for his drippy style, Pollock has a surprisingly legible signature, an unmistakable c before the final k. The skipped consonant would do more than expose a single forgery; it would shatter the reputation of an entire gallery. The sloppy signature was just one of many missed red flags in works falsely attributed to Rothko, De Kooning, Motherwell and others that the Knoedler & Co gallery, one of New York's oldest and most esteemed art institutions, succeeded in selling for $80m. The fraudulent works had been supplied by a dubious dealer who claimed they came from an enigmatic collector, Mr X. Just before the scandal erupted in the press, the gallery closed its doors after 165 years, while the suspected perpetrator of the fakes, a self-taught Chinese septuagenarian by the name of Pei-Shen Qian, who had operated from a forger's workshop in Queens, vanished;he later turned up in China. -- If you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

    "section": "arts",
    "content": "The building of the Sydney Opera House began on 2 March 1959. But when BBC Tonight visited the construction site in 1965, it was plagued by technical problems, soaring costs, vacillating public opinion and political infighting. In 1965, BBC reporter Trevor Philpott sat overlooking Sydney Harbour as he tried to find the right metaphor to describe the vibrant, arching structures of Jørn Utzon's roof design for the Australian city's Opera House. It was a score of towering shells. It was a cluster of seagulls spreading concrete wings. It was a huddle of sailing boats with billowing concrete sails, said Philpott. He then added the caveat: And it was an unmitigated bitch to build. The fraught saga of the Sydney Opera House's construction began on 2 March 1959, 66 years ago this week. Six years after that, when BBC Tonight's Philpott went to see the building's progress, it was already years behind schedule, mired in spiralling costs, changing designs and escalating political tensions. To say it was having a difficult birth would be an understatement. The idea to build an opera house for the city had been proposed in the late 1940s by an acclaimed English conductor, Sir Eugene Goossens. At the time, Goossens was something of a celebrity in the classical music world, having carved out a successful career in the UK and the US. After World War Two, he had been lured to Sydney to become the director of the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music with the promise of a salary greater than that of the Australian Prime Minister, musicologist Dr Drew Crawford told the BBC podcastA Very Australian Scandalin 2023. The creation of a new, world-class music performance venue was the conductor's passion project. He had spied from his office window what he believed was the ideal site for it – the tram depot at Bennelong Point. Known to the local indigenous Gadigal people of the Eora nation as Tubowgule, it was a place where Aboriginal celebrations had been held for thousands of years. Throughout the 1950s, Goossens lobbied hard, trying to turn his dream into a reality. There were very few other people who could have that vision, articulate that vision, and have the ear of the Premier [of New South Wales], have the ear of the Prime Minister, be able to talk to people to get it going, said Dr Crawford. Goossens convinced the Premier of New South Wales, Joseph Cahill, that an opera house would reshape the world's view of Australia, that he had found the perfect site for it, and that they should launch a grand competition, open to the architects of all the world, to decide exactly what manner of a building they should put there, said Philpott. They made only one condition, that nothing quite so remarkable should have been ever built before. Goossens himself would not get to see his ambition realised. In 1956, having just picked up his knighthood in the UK, he was detained upon his entry back into Australia, where his bags were searched and found to contain, among other things, smuggled pornography, compromising photographs and rubber masks. The resultingscandal, which involved affairs, erotica and witchcraft, completely scuppered the conductor's career in Sydney. He fled the country for Rome, traveling under the alias of Mr E Gray, never to return. However, the design competition went ahead as planned, with a panel of judges evaluating some 233 submitted entries. At the start 1957, the government announced that a largely unknown Danish architect, Utzon, was the unexpected winner. Part of the surprise at Utzon's success was that his entry had largely consisted of preliminary sketches and concept drawings. As far as building anything of any scale, he hadn't really done very much, Sir Jack Zunz, who worked on the project for the civil engineering firm Arup, toldBBC Witness Historyin 2018. The judges' choice of Utzon's bold and imaginative design was not without controversy. From the first, it stirred the people of Sydney to breathless wonder and scalding abuse, said Philpott. It was called the Sydney Harbour monster, a piece of Danish pastry, a disintegrating circus tent. Premier Cahill, worried that the project might be derailed by adverse public opinion or political opposition, pushed for construction work to start early. This was despite the fact that Utzon was still finalising the building's actual design, and had yet to resolve critical structural issues. Although Utzon's design was thought to be one of the cheapest, there were still problems raising money for it, so a State Lottery was launched in 1957 to help fund the project. The initial estimate of the final cost of the Sydney Opera House was put at A£3.5m or A$7m – at the time, Australia's official currency was the pound, but was replaced by the dollar in 1966. The building was set to open on 26 January 1963: Australia Day. Both of these predictions would prove to be wildly and hopelessly optimistic. Right from the beginning, the house was full of trouble: human, mechanical, structural, reported Philpott. The building of the Opera House was divided into three distinct phases: construction of the podium, the roof shells, and the interior. Cahill, having persuaded the Minister of Transport to agree to the tram depot being demolished to build the podium, found the site was neither big enough nor strong enough to carry that structure that seemed on paper light enough to fly away, said Philpott. To bear the weight of the Opera House, the whole site needed to be extended and reinforced by driving over 550 steel-cased concrete shafts, each three feet in diameter, into land in and around Sydney Harbour. This extensive work, which had not been accounted for in either the construction's budget or its timescale, dragged on, hampered by bad weather. The podium would only be completed in January 1963 – the original date for when the Opera House was meant to open. But this would merely be the first of the project's delays and eye-watering extra costs. The Opera House's most distinctive feature, its roof shells which mimicked a ship's sails, were to present a whole other set of engineering headaches. Initially, the plan had been to make the roof out of steel coated with concrete. However, that design presented unwelcome noise problems for any performance taking place. The Opera House stars would have been singing above the sirens of the tugboats on the water outside, and the temperature variations would have caused the metal and concrete to rumble and crack like tropical thunder, said Philpott. Nobody had also fully understood the scale of the engineering challenge that the Opera House's daring curved roof surfaces presented. Since Utzon's entry lacked detailed engineering plans, civil engineering firm Arup had been brought in to work out how to construct the roof's complex shell structure. But despite trying multiple different redesigns, they could not make the structural calculations add up. The first thing Arup did when they were asked to collaborate, they took these free shapes and developed a series of mathematical models which, near as possible, matched Utzon's competition design. None of these shapes appeared buildable, Zunz told BBC Witness History. Another issue was that, because the roof was curved, each concrete rib that supported it would be different. That meant that instead of having just one mould that could be reused to cast all the supporting beams, each individual rib would need a separate one. This was prohibitively expensive. The answer, Utzon would later claim, came to him while he was peeling an orange. The architect realised that all segments of the roof could come from the geometry of a single sphere. By identifying which part of the sphere best suited the shapes they needed, a series of triangles each with one curved side could be cut from it, creating a variety of shells. These spherical shell segments could be broken down into individual components, which could be uniformly pre-cast in concrete and assembled onsite. He came back a week later and said, 'I've solved it.' And he made the scheme out of a sphere, said Arup's Zunz. But in so doing, he had changed the architecture quite radically. This elegant solution simplified the roof's construction and reduced waste, enabling the building of the vaulted roof to begin in 1963. But as the contractors worked on executing Utzon's vision, the project was dogged by labour disputes, design changes and rising material costs, making its budget balloon and its potential completion date disappear into the distance. By 1962, the cost had risen to A£12.5m, and now everybody admitted they were only guessing, said Philpott. The opening day was postponed and postponed again. It had been planned for Australia Day 1963, it was put off until early 1964, then until sometime in 1966, and now no one is bold enough even to predict the year the doors may eventually open. The project's biggest government supporter, Premier Cahill, had taken ill just months after building work had started. On his deathbed in 1959, he had made his Minister for Public Works, Norman Ryan, promise not to let the Opera House fail. Ryan, when interviewed by the BBC's Philpott in 1965, gamely made a spirited defence of the project, but by this time frustration with its mounting costs and endless delays was palpable. I wasn't sure whether to admit to working on it at the time, admitted Zunz. If you went into a taxi, you got an earful of all the money that was being wasted, and God knows what. Adding to this contentious atmosphere, a few months after Ryan's BBC interview, Robert Askin, who had vocally opposed the project, was elected the New South Wales Premier. He appointed Davis Hughes as the new Minister for Public Works, who clashed repeatedly with Utzon. Hughes, determined to rein in spending, began to challenge the architect's costs and schedules, demanding a full set of working drawings for the interiors – the next stage of the project. The whole situation started going downhill, said Zunz. Utzon couldn't, wouldn't, anyway didn't produce the documents his client desired. In retaliation, Hughes refused the payments demanded by the construction team, which left Utzon unable to pay his staff. In 1966, the Danish architect resigned from the project and left Australia, never returning to see his Opera House completed. Utzon's resignation led to a public outcry, with 1,000 people taking to Sydney's streets on 3 March 1966 to demand that he be reinstated. Instead, Hughes appointed a new panel of Australian architects to complete the interior as well as the glass walls. But if Hughes thought this would reduce costs and speed up the project, he was very much mistaken. The new team scrapped most of Utzon's plans for the interior and radically redesigned it. Utzon had envisioned a dual purpose for the main hall, as an opera venue and a concert hall, but this was now viewed as unworkable, leading to the already installed stage production machinery having to be demolished. The new design also meant that each of the hundreds of pieces of glass in the interior walls needed to be cut to a unique size and shape, which continued to pile on the costs. The Sydney Opera House's spiralling bill was pushed even higher when a labour dispute by union workers, over the dismissal of a worker and demands for better wages, culminated in a sit-in strike at the site in 1972. But the following year, the monumental undertaking that was the construction of the Sydney Opera House was finally completed. Ten years late and 14 times over its initial budget, it came in at a cost of A$102m (£51m). It was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 October 1973. The monarch praised the stunning building that had captured the imagination of the world while also wryly mentioning that I understand that its construction has not been totally without problems. Utzondeclined to attendits opening, writing to Premier Askin that he couldn't see anything positive in the interior work done by the Australian architects and it would not be possible for him to avoid making very negative statements. More like this: •The first ever video game console •How the fall of the Berlin Wall reshaped Europe •How music saved a cellist's life in Auschwitz The Danish architect did end up making peace and reengaging with the Sydney Opera House project in 1999, agreeing to work on the A$66m (£33m) renovation of its interior. In September 2004, the Reception Hall was renamedthe Utzon Roomin his honour after being redesigned by him. In the years since its completion, acclaim for Sydney Opera House'svisionary architecturehas only grown. Its distinctive sculptural form has made it one of the most immediately recognisable buildings in the world. More than 10.9m people visit it annually, and it has come to epitomise theAustralian national identity, its soaring roof a celebration of creativity, culture and ambition in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. As avenue, it has played host to everyone from Bob Dylan, Ella Fitzgerald and Sammy Davis Jnr to The Cure, Björk and Massive Attack. In 1980, Arnold Schwarzenegger won his final body-building title there, and 10 years later anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela made one of his first major speeches from its steps following his release from prison. In 2004, Cathy Freeman, the first Aboriginal athlete to win an individual Olympic gold medal, opened the Olympic torch relay from outside the building. Its eye-catching roof is illuminated every year as part of Vivid Sydney, the city's festival of light, music and ideas, and in 2017, stories of Indigenous Australia told in vibrant animations were projected onto it. In 2007, the building that had been brought about by a combination of art, engineering and sheer bloody-minded perseverance was formally recognised as a World Heritage Site by Unesco. On recommending its inclusion, the International Council on Monuments and Sites declared: The Sydney Opera House stands by itself as one of the indisputable masterpieces of human creativity, not only in the 20th Century but in the history of humankind. -- For more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to theIn History newsletter, whileThe Essential Listdelivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

    "title": "A glimpse at Picasso and Pollock masterpieces kept in Tehran vault",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clye46n565xo",
    "section": "arts",
    "content": "It has been dubbed one of the world's rarest treasure troves of art but few people outside its host country know about it. For decades, masterpieces by the likes of Pablo Picasso, Vincent Van Gogh, Andy Warhol and Jackson Pollock have been kept in the basement of a museum in Iran's capital Tehran, shrouded in mystery. According to estimates in 2018, the collection is worthas much as $3bn. Only a small portion of the work has been exhibited since the 1979 Iranian Revolution but in recent years, the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art has been showcasing some of its most captivating pieces. The Eye to Eye exhibition at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art, which opened in October 2024, was extended twice due to overwhelming public demand, running until January 2025. The display was widely regarded as one of the most significant exhibitions in the history of the museum, and it also became its most visited. The showcase featured more than 15 works unveiled for the first time, including a sculpture by Jean Dubuffet - marking its first-ever appearance in an Iranian exhibition. From abstract expressionism to pop art, the collection at the museum serves as a time capsule of pivotal artistic movements. Among the artwork is Warhol's portrait of Farah Pahlavi - Iran's last queen - a rare piece blending his pop art flair with Iranian cultural history. Elsewhere, Francis Bacon's work called Two Figures Lying on a Bed with Attendants shows figures appearing to spy on two naked men lying on a bed. On the opposite wall in the basement of the museum, a portrait of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, is on display in juxtaposition. The museum was built in 1977 under the patronage of Pahlavi, the exiled widow of the last Shah of Iran who was overthrown during the revolution. Pahlavi was a passionate art advocate and her cousin, architect Kamran Diba, designed the museum. It was established to introduce modern art to Iranians and to bridge Iran closer to the international art scene. The museum soon became home to a stunning array of works by luminaries including Picasso, Warhol and Salvador Dali, alongside pieces by leading Iranian modernists, and quickly established itself as a beacon of cultural exchange and artistic ambition. But then came the 1979 revolution. Iran became an Islamic republic as the monarchy was overthrown and clerics assumed political control under Ayatollah Khomeini. Many artworks were deemed inappropriate for public display because of nudity, religious sensitivities or political implications. Pierre-Auguste Renoir's Gabrielle with Open Blouse was deemed too scandalous. And Warhol's portrait of the former queen of Iran was too political. In fact, Pahlavi's portrait was vandalised and torn apart with a knife during the revolutionary turmoil. After the revolution, many of the artworks were locked away, collecting dust in a basement that became the stuff of art world legend. It was only in the late 1990s that the museum reclaimed its cultural significance during the reformist presidency of Mohammad Khatami. Suddenly the world remembered what it had been missing. Art lovers could not believe their eyes. Van Gogh, Dali, even Monet - all in Tehran. Some pieces were loaned to major exhibitions in Europe and the United States, briefly reconnecting the collection with the global art world. Hamid Keshmirshekan, an art historian based in London, has studied the collection and calls it one of the rarest treasure troves of modern art outside the West. The collection includes Henry's Moore's Reclining Figure series - an iconic piece by one of Britain's most celebrated sculptors - and Jackson Pollock's Mural on Indian Red Ground, a vibrant example of the American's painting technique pulsing with energy and emotion. Picasso's The Painter and His Model - his largest canvas from 1927 - also features, a strong example of his abstract works from the post-cubism period. And there is Van Gogh's At Eternity's Gate - one of the very rare survivals of his first printmaking campaign during which he produced six lithographs in November 1882. But for art lovers in Britain, the collection is out of reach. The UK Foreign Office advises against all travel to Iran and says British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention. Having a British passport or connections to the UK can be reason enough for detention by the Iranian authorities, it says. Challenges remain for the museum which operates under a tight budget. Shifting political priorities mean that it often functions more as a cultural hub than a traditional museum. Yet it continues to be a remarkable institution - an unlikely guardian of modern art masterpieces in the heart of Tehran.",

    "title": "The rare blue the Maya invented",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20180816-the-rare-blue-the-mayans-invented",
    "section": "arts",
    "content": "The colour survives in the work of 17th Century Spanish colonial painters, a symbol of the wealth that ultimately doomed the Maya, writes Devon Van Houten Maldonado. In 17th Century Europe, when Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio and Peter Paul Rubens painted their famous masterworks, ultramarine blue pigment made from the semi-precious lapis lazuli stone was mined far away in Afghanistan and cost more than its weight in gold. Only the most illustrious painters were allowed to use the costly material, while lesser artists were forced to use duller colours that faded under the sun. It wasn’t until the industrial revolution in the 19th Century that a synthetic alternative was invented, and true ultramarine blue finally became widely available. Across the Atlantic Ocean, colonial Baroque works created by artists like José Juárez, Baltasar de Echave Ibia and Cristóbal de Villalpando in early 17th Century Mexico – New Spain – were full of this beautiful blue. How could this be? Lapis lazuli was even rarer in the New World. It wasn’t until the middle of the 20th Century that archaeologists discovered the Maya had invented a resilient and brilliant blue, centuries before their land was colonised and their resources exploited.  - What connects Adam and Eve to Tinder  -The world’s most mysterious silver cups -How Van Gogh found Japan in Provence The ultramarine blue procured from lapis lazuli in Europe was not only incredibly expensive, but also extremely laborious to make. In Europe, blue was reserved for the most important subject matter. Rubens' Adoration of the Magi – the version that hangs in the Museo del Prado in Madrid and which he worked on for over 20 years – is an example. The colour was primarily used to paint the robes of the Virgin Mary, and later extended to include other royalty and holy figures. In Mexico, on the other hand, blue was used to paint altogether less holy and everyday subjects. Archaeologists studying pre-Hispanic Mesoamerican ruins were surprised by the discovery of blue murals in the Maya Riviera, modern day Mexico and Guatemala, from as early as 300 AD, perhaps the most famous being the murals at the temple of Chichén Itzá (created around 450 AD). The colour had a special ceremonial significance for the Maya. They covered sacrificial victims and the altars on which they were offered in a brilliant blue paint, writes Diego de Landa Calderón, a bishop in colonial Mexico during the 16th Century, in his first-hand account. Archaeologists were puzzled by the resilience of the blue in the murals. The añil plant, part of the indigo family, was widely available in the region but was mostly used for dyes rather than paint. Indigo was quick to fade in the sunlight and natural elements, so experts mused that the Maya couldn’t have used the same widely available dye to paint the murals. It wasn’t until the late 1960s that the source of Maya blue’s resilience through the centuries was discovered: a rare clay called attapulgite, which was mixed with the dye from the añil plant. During colonisation native materials like Maya blue and cochineal were exploited along with every other resource of the land and its people in the New World. These colours, which supposedly represented the wealth of the Maya empire, would stand as a symbol of all that would be plundered. Rhapsody in blue Master painters from the Americas are discussed in art history – if they’re mentioned at all – as a lesser school of Baroque compared to Caravaggio and Rubens. It's overly simplistic to assume that these Baroque masters were only impersonating their European predecessors. In fact, second and third generation painters born in Mexico City, such as Juárez and Echave Ibia, departed from European aesthetics, but arrived to something uniquely layered: enormous and sophisticated compositions that drew upon the full vibrancy of the New World. At Mexico’s National Art Museum (Munal) in Mexico City, works by Juárez seen chronologically show his development from a European impersonator to a New Spanish Baroque master. His early canvases departed from the dramatic spotlighting and warmth of European Baroque imagery and later moved into cold saturation throughout the picture plane (vibrant blues, yellows, greens and reds), multiple light sources, collaged compositions and grand scale – and in part because the use of local materials, such as Maya blue, expanded his palette. While Rubens also used vibrant colours, his compositions, on the whole, were more chaotic and warmer than those of Juárez. His pallet was even more vibrant than Rubens’, perhaps the most vibrant of the European Baroques, but his compositions were more akin to Caravaggio. Caravaggio's canvases were, without fail, full of rich reds and yellows, but nearly devoid of blue – if you think of a Caravaggio masterpiece, blue is usually absent. The closest to a blue-tinted Caravaggio you can find is Juárez’s work, but, despite his prolific reach and realised compositions, Juárez died in poverty.  If Juárez died without a peso to his name, how would he have had the resources to order large quantities of precious lapis lazuli from Europe? On the other hand, Villalpando, often said to be the most prolific colonial painter in New Spain, imitated the chaotic compositions by Rubens. Villalpando fits more neatly into the European history of Baroque painting and didn't depart from Rubens' ‘fear of space’ – the Baroque notion that every space of the canvas must crammed with imagery and incident – thus he was accepted by the canon of art history as the mascot of Novohispanic Baroque painting. Still, as much as he wanted to imitate Rubens, Villalpando painted with Mesoamerican materials and labour. The consistent result – the same as his peers in Mexico – was that his paintings and murals were cooler and more saturated. His mural adorning the dome of Puebla's cathedral was the first and only of its kind in New Spain. Swirling blue and purple clouds back the images of the virgin, the saints and the angels painted by Villalpando. Even though he sought to make European Baroque in the Americas, his materials gave him away as a criollo, a non-mixed-race descendant of the original Spanish settlers, from Mexico City. Baltasar de Echave Ibia painted such elaborate blues that he became known as ‘El Echave de los azules’ (the Echave of the blues). His father, Baltasar de Echave Orio, also used blue generously, but Echave Ibia was especially famous for his copious use and mastery of the colour. There is a reason why Ibia, working in Mexico City between the 17th and 18th Centuries, had access to seemingly limitless amounts of blue. All three had had sources of the brilliant colour closer to home. The lack of written evidence of the use of añil or Maya blue in Novohispanic Baroque paintings is made up for with visual evidence. From these painters and others in the colonised Americas it's apparent that Baroque artists in the New World weren’t using the same blue pigment as their European peers. The lapis lazuli blue being used in Europe was a dark ultramarine blue. While the blue being used in New Spain reflected the vivid azure, originally extracted from añil by the Maya. Maya blue is one of the most durable of all Mesoamerican colours, as seen in the 1,600-year-old murals at Chichén Itzá. Perhaps the same resistance to time has kept Baroque canvases and murals in the Americas, from Mexico to Peru, bright through the centuries. This cross-pollination of influences, from Maya to European Baroque, happening in Latin America on the canvases of criollo painters suggests globalism began much sooner than academic history has led us to believe.

    "section": "arts",
    "content": "Green has symbolised both decay and regeneration, offering a bridge between this world and the next, writes Kelly Grovier. Beware of green. It can’t be trusted. Leonardo da Vinci knew, and cautioned his contemporaries against the pigment’s toxic instability. Its beauty, Leonardo warned, “vanishes into thin air”. Volatile and evanescent, green is more than just a colour. It is the energy that connects us to the unknown. Remove green from the palette of art history and a bridge between life and death would disappear. Equal parts morbid and vital, green curdles the cadaverous cheeks of Pablo Picasso’s macabre portrait of his young friend, Carlos Casagemas, who shot himself dead in lovelorn torment at the age of 20, while at the same time ignites with joyous chlorophyllic fire the life-affirming and ever-verdant canvases of Claude Monet. More like this: -The insect that painted Europe red -The toxic colour that comes from volcanoes -The racist message hidden in a masterpiece To dabble in green is not merely to tread a path between being and unbeing, but to make inroads into the mysteries of each. Simultaneously the colour of putrefaction and of verdurous regeneration, green participates with unbiased vividity in decay and rebirth. Perhaps it is green’s teasing ambiguity that compelled Leonardo himself, against his own better counsel, to clad his most famous and enigmatic subject, the Mona Lisa, in a darkening shade of that colour – one that has since bruised itself to a sublime and submarine blackness in the subconscious of cultural history. Donning the deepest of shadowy green costumes, La Gioconda night-swims in the vitrine of our psyche and has long been recognised as a mystical commuter between the world of the living and that of the dead. “Like the vampire,” the 19th-Century English essayist Walter Pater once wrote of her, “she has been dead many times and learned the secrets of the grave”. Describing Leonardo’s inscrutable sitter as “older than the rocks among which she sits”, Pater proceeds to imagine that Mona Lisa has, throughout history, returned again and again as everything from “a diver in deep seas” to a savvy operator who has woven “strange webs with Eastern merchants”. Ceaselessly resurgent in her murky green gown, which symbolised her status as a merchant’s wife, Mona, according to Pater, was “the mother of Helen of Troy” and the “mother Mary”. Long before Leonardo reached for green, the colour had been assigned a special esoteric place in cultural imagination. Ancient Egyptians reserved green for the bold beryl complexion of their god of life and death, Osiris – ruler of the underworld, who held dominion over the passage of souls between this world and the next. Typical depictions of Osiris, such as one found on the 13th-Century BC walls of the burial tomb of Horemheb, the last monarch of the 18th dynasty of Egypt, portray a skinny, grassy-skinned god, whose false pharaoh’s beard marks him out as a deity of incontestable pre-eminence. Perennially young, Osiris was believed to be a serial resuscitator, both of himself and of the natural world. Holding sway over the flow of floods and flourishing of flora alike, leafy-cheeked Osiris, it was believed, would eventually show the souls of Egypt’s kings the path to resurrection. Flora and fauna For millennia, concocting green pigments was achieved by a variety of artistic alchemies that harnessed the hues of everything from pulverised malachite to the juice of buckthorn berries, from dessicated foxgloves and fraxinus leaves, to soaking yellow saffron in the purple dye of woad, also known as the ‘The Asp of Jerusalem’. Verdigris, among the more common iterations of the colour, and the one of which Leonardo was most wary, is forged in a curious ritual that involves the slow sousing in wine of a brass or copper blade. An acetic crust of green that scabs to the metallic surface is then scraped clean and ground into pigment. It was a green ghost of similar chemical contrivance that confirmed to scientists digging recently for the remains of the 16th-Century Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe that they had indeed found their target. Known to have worn a prosthetic nose to replace the one he’d lost in a sword fight in 1566, Brahe’s aesthetic skull bore traces of copper and zinc when, like a disciple of Osiris, it eventually came up for air in 2012. Fertile with life, even in death, the invocation of green in countless masterpieces from antiquity to the present day impregnates our eye with expectancy. Everything about the physique, posture and gestures of Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini’s green-enrobed wife, who seems to rest her tired hand tenderly on her tummy’s bump in Jan van Eyck’s famous painting, The Arnolfini Portrait (painted in 1434), leads our modern mind to suspect that she is pregnant, however convinced art historians may be that she isn’t. The great gush of cascading green that capsizes our eye, scholars contend, is more likely a symbol of hope for the eventual blessing of children. Green springs eternal. An alternative reading of the riddling portrait only amplifies the eeriness of green’s potential to wed the living and the dead. According to one theory, the depiction of the woman in Van Eyck’s work is herself a composite double-portrait of two successive wives of Giovanni di Nicolao – his first having died in childbirth. Supporters of this view point to tropes of death that haunt the painting, such as the extinguished wick on the candle above her. Certainly the complex convex mirror, bolted to the back of the painting, which warps the couple’s reflection as if into a different continuum of reality, compounds the sense of strangely splitting selves that reverberate from the painting. If ever there was a colour capable of cloaking such a curious compression of life and death, it’s green. So green goes, sowing into the story of art the mysteries of our own fleeting appearance in the world. The murky green water that laps against the ochre edge of the River Stour in John Constable’s famous Romantic landscape The Hay Wain, delineates a boundary between the world that the artist can see in the here-and-now and one that haunts his imagination from childhood. Look closer at the weave of summer greenness at which the little dog in the foreground appears to pant, and you can barely discern the ghost of a horseman and barrel that the artist had once intended to include in the painting – a spectre that, over time, is re-sculpting itself from the verdurous summer air that Constable has mystically conjured. Though rightly celebrated for the accuracy of his carefully observed clouds, Constable is a master too of earthy hues and terrestrial textures. The tapestry of greens he weaves in The Hay Wain is a tour de force of that colour’s ability to convey the vibrancy of nostalgia for a place that ceaselessly shifts in one’s memory between wilting loss and luminous revelation. Hiding in plain sight In more recent eras of artistic expression, green has continued to be an enigmatic hue that hides as much as it reveals. Paul Gauguin’s seminal symbolist painting Green Christ (1889) is a teasing tangle of the colour’s contradictory connotations. Over a stone statue of the deceased Christ in the middle distance of the painting, a lucent layer of moss has stitched itself like a second skin. The face of a Breton woman, who stands in the shadow of that sculpture, is tinged a sepulchral green, as if she were slowly turning into the life-in-death and death-in-life statue – as if a kind of chromatic continuum exists between the physical world she inhabits and a mystical one that lies beyond. Belgian surrealist painter René Magritte’s famous anti-self-portrait, The Son of Man (1964), defies the logic of likenesses by refusing to let the viewer see the key features of the artist’s face by interposing between them and us the greenest of green apples the mind is capable of picturing. “Everything we see hides another thing, we always want to see what is hidden by what we see,” Magritte observed to an interviewer. “There is an interest in that which is hidden and which the visible does not show us. This interest can take the form of quite an intense feeling, a sort of conflict one might say, between the visible that is hidden and the visible that is present.” No contemporary artist has understood more profoundly the rhythms of the visible that is not there and the visible that is, than the Irish-American abstract painter Sean Scully. The bold vertical columns of Scully’s The Bather (1983), inspired by Henri Matisse’s Bathers by a River, painted 70 years earlier, are stripped-down stand-ins for the already over-stylised bodies Scully recalls from Matisse’s work. Intensified by the boxy protrusions that complicate the carpentry of Scully’s work, which physically intrudes into the gallery-goer’s space, the ficus greens of Scully’s torso-wide trunks have succeeded in achieving an effect to which centuries of artists have only aspired: converting green from perishable colour into purest feeling.

    "section": "arts",
    "content": "A hue now associated with innocence once had a murkier meaning: Kelly Grovier looks at the ways in which pink has represented violence and seduction. Pink is a double-edged sword. While red is raucous and racy, and white is prim and pure, pink cuts both ways. Long before the word “pink” attached itself to the pretty pastel shade of delicate carnations, as we define the term today, the London underworld enlisted it for something rather less frilly or fragrant – to denote the act of stabbing someone with a sharp blade. “He pink’d his Dubblet”, so reads an entry for the word in a 17th-Century dictionary of street slang used by “Beggars, Shoplifters, Highwaymen, Foot-Pads and all other Clans of Cheats and Villains”, describing a lethal lunge through a man’s padded jacket, “He run him through”. More like this: -The insect that painted Europe red -The toxic colour that comes from volcanoes -The racist message hidden in a masterpiece At what point the unlikely linguistic slide was made from mortal piercing to mellow pigment, no one can say for sure. But the enticing hue itself, by whatever name it was known before the assignment of “pink” to the colour chart in the 18th Century, has kept culture blushing since antiquity. Now seductive, now innocent, pink is coquettish and coy, sultry and sly. Remove pink from the palette of art history and a teasing dimension to the story of image-making would be lost. Edgar Degas’s Pink Dancers would fall flat-footed and Pablo Picasso’s pivotal pink period wouldn’t rise to the occasion. A flesh in the pan A key moment in pink’s emergence as an essential element in the development of painting is the creation by the Early Renaissance Italian painter Fra Angelico in the middle of the 15th Century of his famous fresco in the Convent of San Marco in Florence, Italy, The Annunciation, which depicts the moment in the New Testament that the Virgin Mary is informed by the Archangel Gabriel that she will become the mother of Christ. Situated at the top of a staircase solemnly ascended daily by pious monks, Fra Angelico’s ground-breaking painting is one into which an observer’s spirit is summoned to levitate. Crucial to sparking that mystical lift-off in the fresco is the portrayal of the ethereal Archangel – who has himself mystically crossed planes of being to swoop into Mary’s material sphere. Never mind the polychromatic wings, what’s most surprising about Gabriel’s depiction is Fra Angelico’s decision to clad him in plush pleats of sumptuous pink. We know from a contemporary artist’s handbook on how to concoct pigments (Cennino Ceninni’s Il libro dell'arte, published a few decades before Fra Angelico painted his fresco) that pink had been traditionally reserved primarily for the rendering of flesh. “Made from the loveliest and lightest sinopia that is found and is mixed and mulled with St. John’s white”, Cennini explains, “this pigment does you great credit if you use it for painting faces, hands and nudes on walls”. By draping Gabriel in the lushest of pinks, Fra Angelico fleshes the Archangel out as a being of body and blood, breaking down the distinction between holy spirit and ephemeral flesh. Pink is the pivot that humanises heaven. No one would ever see the colour the same way again. In the ensuing centuries, artists would invoke pink as shorthand for the blurring of boundaries. Bloom of Christ As the focus of Renaissance master Raphael’s Madonna of the Pinks, a sprig of blushing carnations handed to the Virgin Mary by the infant Christ, may seem unremarkable enough at first glance. In fact it amounts to a kind of miraculous wrinkle in the fabric of time. According to religious tradition,dianthus(the Greek name for the plant, meaning “flower of God”), did not appear in the world until Mary wept at her son’s crucifixion. The flower’s anachronistic appearance in Raphael’s scene, therefore, tinged with the future blood of the baby who holds it, mysteriously establishes a pink kink in the linear unfolding of the universe. Over time, pink would eventually blossom beyond the petals of its complex theologies to inflect a wider array of secular personality, all the while retaining its elusive allure and capacity to tease. By the 18th Century, pink was offering itself as the colour of choice for portraying high-profile mistresses, daring observers to deny its very legitimacy as a respectable hue. Famous portraits by the French Rococo portraitist Maurice Quentin de la Tour of Madame de Pompadour and by the English artist George Romney of his muse Emma, Lady Hamilton (later mistress of Lord Nelson), posing as a mythological maenad, reveal how decidedly deconsecrated the colour had become. La Tour’s full-length pastel-pencil portrait of the official chief mistress to Louis XV of France, begun around 1748, is a rumbunctious jungle gym of superfluous pinks that spider across every inch and threaten to suffocate its subject. Here, pink is an energy that vibrates from the sitter to the secular subjects with which Pompadour has surrounded herself – music, astronomy, and literature. Porcelain pink A patron of the porcelain trade, Pompadour had famously inspired the minting by the Sevres porcelain factory of a new hue of pink, delicately bruised by dabs of blue and black. To Pompadour, pink was no longer a mere accessory but a partner in crime – an aspirational second skin into which she grew intellectually and emotionally. She became her colour. No painting embodies pink’s gradual pendulum movement from the spiritual to the secular more vividly than the French artist Jean-Honoré Fragonard’s exuberant The Swing, painted around 1767, between La Tour’s and Romney’s works. Here, a fabulous flounce of flowing rose is frozen in mid swivel as the swinging girl, pillowed in pinkness, flicks loose a silk shoe, attracting the titillated attention of any number of camouflaged male gazes hiding in the bushes around her. We’re a long way from the pink whisper of angels now. In more recent times, pink continues to be seized upon by artists keen to confound our expectations of what notes or message the floral pigment can confidently carry. Having established a formidable reputation in the middle of the 20th Century as a first-generation Abstract Expressionist, eschewing figurative subjects entirely in the 1950s, Canadian-born American artist Philip Guston reached for pink in a dramatic turn back to representational art in the late 1960s. By then, the colour itself had undergone something of a commercial transformation in American retail culture, having begun the century as a shade more often associated with boys and masculinity than fairy princesses and little girls’ dolls. But by the time Guston began introducing a menacing cast of Ku Klux Klan-inspired cartoon goons, whose implausibly pale pink stubby hoods continue to menace popular imagination to this day, the colour had been re-commodified as delicate and feminine. Grabbing pink by the scruff for his unsettling scenes of a seedy Americana, Guston slaps Barbie across the chops. At the same moment that Guston’s provocative pink was poking the art world in the eye, scientific studies were underway by Alexander Schauss, Director of the American Institute for Biosocial Research, to determine whether manipulations of the colour could help control the behaviour of subjects surrounded by it. The result of Schauss’s investigation was the concoction of the psychologically subtle shade now known as “Baker-Miller Pink”, after the Naval correctional institute in Seattle, Washington where the pigment was successfully tested on the walls of inmates’ cells and credited with a significant calming of aggressive urges. Yet despite its ability to inspire docility, pink is still picking fights, challenging our perceptions to an aesthetic duel. Upon learning that the British artist Anish Kapoor had signed a contract giving him exclusive rights to a recently engineered colour known as Vantablack (the darkest shade ever devised), and the legal right to prohibit other artists from doing so, Kapoor’s younger contemporary Stuart Semple saw red. Emboldened by Kapoor’s black embargo, Semple began concocting a supremely-fluorescent pink paint he contends is the “pinkest pink” ever contemplated (“no one has ever seen a pinker pink”, he insists). As a poke in the eye of Kapoor, Semple has made his colour available at a small price to anyone in the world so long as they confirm that they are not Anish Kapoor nor friendly enough with Kapoor to share it with him. En garde, Kapoor. You’ve been pink’d. If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to ourFacebookpage or message us onTwitter.

    "content": "For centuries, the orange pigment was sourced from a toxic mineral. Kelly Grovier looks at a hue that alchemists believed was crucial to creating the Philosopher’s Stone – and which allows art to swivel between different states of being. Expunge orange from the history of art and the whole thing collapses. The sky above Edvard Munch’s The Scream falls down and the fire that ignites Frederic Leighton’s famous Flaming June flames out. Take away orange, and everything from the warm eternal glow of Egyptian tomb painting to the troubled stubble of Vincent van Gogh’s smouldering self-portraits vanishes. A savvy arbiter between resolute red and unyielding yellow, orange is a pigment that pivots. It’s a hinge of a hue that enables a work of art to swivel between contrary states of being – this world and another, life and death. Outside the frame of art history, orange has proved an unusually elastic symbol, blossoming into a spectrum of shapes and cultural meanings. Although the influential European royal House of Orange traces its name back further than the actual coining of the colour in the 1540s, its prominent son, William III (better known as William of Orange), quickly embraced the linguistic coincidence in the 1570s. His orange-white-and-blue rebel flag would become the forerunner of the modern tricolour of The Netherlands. From there orange took on the complexion of everything from Swiss fire engines to the suits worn by astronauts in the International Space Station. But it’s in the realms of art and aesthetics that the colour has fructified more soulfully. From antiquity to the end of the 19th Century, a volcanic mineral found in sulphurous fumaroles (great gashes in the Earth’s crust) was a significant source for the harvesting of orange pigment. The highly toxic orpiment, rich in lethal arsenic, ripens from mellow yellow into outrageous orange when subjected to the heat of a fire. Convinced that the luminous shimmer of orpiment (its name is a contraction of Latinaurum, meaning ‘gold’, andpigmentummeaning ‘colour’) must be a key ingredient in concocting the Philosopher’s Stone, alchemists for centuries risked exposure to the noxious substance. So did artists. To dabble in the occult of orange was to flirt with mortality and immortality in equal measure. A spark to a flame Intentionally or not, that ambiguous aura is irrepressible wherever orange is conjured in art. Take for example the French Rococo painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard’s portrait of a generic writer captured at a moment of intense vision: Inspiration, painted around 1769. The poet’s plush orange jacket – its vibrant rumples flickering like flares – threatens to engulf the allegorical subject of a poet whose imagination has just been ignited. The furrowed velour has become an outward reflection of the writer’s mind. This evaporative moment of reverie that illuminates the subject, as if from inside his soul, will either ensure his eternal fame as a celebrated bard or will set on fire his very being. Fashion him in any other colour than orange and the work’s flustering power would be utterly lost. Nor is it possible to imagine Self-portrait with Halo and Snake, painted by the post-Impressionist Paul Gauguin more than a century after Fragonard’s canvas, soaked in any other colours than the two competing complexions of orange that dominate and divide its radiant surface into competing territories of piousness and malevolence. Created by Gauguin while living in the North-western French fishing village of Le Pouldu, the work portrays, in its upper half, a saintly indifference to worldly temptations, as symbolised by a dangling sprig of forbidden fruit. To make certain we don’t miss the unmissable point, the artist has crowned himself in this hemisphere of the work with an angelic halo. The lower half of the wood panel, however, reveals an uncontainable susceptibility to evil as the seductive snake from the Garden of Eden has the artist wrapped around his proverbial finger. Tying the work together tonally is a dramatic shift at its equator in shades of orange – not unlike orpiment itself, before and after its purifying baptism by fire. And so it goes, work by work, century after century: wherever the colour orange dictates the temperature of a work of art, we know we’ve arrived at a precarious hinterland between a universe we can see and a mysterious unknown we tentatively feel. How else can you characterise the realm in which the liquified face of Munch’s hero howls under a strange and estranging burnt-cinnamon sky in The Scream? How else can you describe the eternal space in which Henri Matisse’s iconic The Dance whirls apocalyptically on the edge of oblivion? Commissioned in 1909 by a wealthy Russian businessman to adorn the staircase of his mansion, at first glance The Dance might appear the apotheosis of rhythmic delight and synchronised levity. But the eerie apricot tinge of the five ecstatic nudes, who seem to have subsumed into their very being the armageddon orange of Munch’s work, is a tip-off that something more complex and perilous is at play. The two dancers who stretch the foreground of the work have lost their grip on each other’s hands, as the one closest to us begins slipping to the ground. Her left foot is already sliding out of view. Far from depicting untroubled joy, Matisse’s carefully choreographed masterpiece teeters on cosmic disaster. The very rotation of the world is left dangerously in doubt. Amber alert Munch and Matisse set the tone, as it were, for the portentous temperament of orange in modern and contemporary art. Throughout the 20th Century, the ominous refulgence of orange will find itself refracted variously in the works of everyone from Francis Bacon, where it sets the sinister scene for the disturbing Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion (1944), as well as Rene Magritte’s Art of Living (1967), where the colour inflates itself to popping point as a surreal cranium. The syncopated pigments and shudders of Rhythm, joy of life, painted in 1931, is characteristic of how crucial orange is to the work and imagination of the Ukrainian-born French artist Sonia Delauney, who once protested: “You know I don’t like orange”. Like it or not, orange is frequently the heat that holds together – while threatening to break apart – the visual music of her sinuous mosaics. As crucial as orange has been to the story of art through the end of the last century, it has already dyed itself indelibly into the unfolding fabric of contemporary artistic consciousness. Among the most celebrated major works of the new millennium, The Gates, by Bulgarian artist Christo Yavacheff and French artist Jeanne-Claude (known together as Christo and Jeanne-Claude), colonised New York City’s Central Park in February 2005 with over 7,500 passageways – each flowing with orange nylon fabric. The lyrical succession of thresholds, which fostered a poetic sense of the endless comings and goings of life – birth and rebirth, mortality and eternity – could, on reflection, have only been draped in stirring saffron. To some, the colour echoes the robes of Buddhist monks. But to my mind, Christo and Jeanne-Claude (who passed away four years later) were rekindling a sacred flame, inviting those who would come to bask their weary souls in the transformative power of that most mystical of ancient tints: orange.

    "section": "arts",
    "content": "Marcel Duchamp’s last painting has influenced artists for a century. Kelly Grovier looks at how it inspired the modern colour chart – and at its 17th-Century predecessor. This year marks the centenary of one of the more curious milestones in modern cultural history – a landmark in image-making with intriguing echoes of a long-forgotten tome from the 17th Century. In 1918, the French avant-garde artist Marcel Duchamp picked up his brush after a four-year hiatus from painting and created a mysterious work that changed forever the way artists use and understand colour. After completing his painting, Duchamp put his brush back down again and, for the next 50 years (until his death in 1968), never painted another picture. More like this: -When the Parthenon had dazzling colours -The insect that painted Europe red -The subversive power of the pipe The work in question is awkwardly proportioned – over 3m (9.4ft) long, yet barely two-thirds of a metre tall – and was commissioned to hang above a bookcase in the library of the US collector and patron of the arts Katherine Dreier. At first glance, the canvas (which Duchamp eccentrically entitled T um’, a terse abbreviation of the tetchy French phrasetu m’ennuies, or ‘you bore me’) appears to do everything it can to be something other than a painting. Its surface is dominated by shadowy allusions to a series of controversial sculptures that Duchamp had recently been making – found objects such as a hat rack, a corkscrew, and a bicycle wheel – that he christened ‘readymades’. In stark contrast to these large ghostly echoes of another artistic medium, a scatter of worldly debris is strewn across the painting: safety pins, a bolt, and a brush for cleaning bottles.According to Yale University, “Duchamp summarises different ways in which a work of art can suggest reality: as shadow, imitation, or actual object.” Stretching over this odd array of forms is a carefully-rendered cascade of colourful lozenge-shaped tiles that swoop vibrantly into the centre of the painting from the top left, like the tail of a mechanical polychromatic comet. Anyone who has ever shopped in a DIY store for domestic paint will recognise immediately this splay of colour tiles. But in 1918, pigment samples from commercial colour charts were still relatively cutting-edge in their retail trendiness, having only hit shop floors towards the end of the previous century. As yet unassigned to an actual object, these ‘readymade’ swatches of colour are at once both physical and theoretical; they haver between the real world of things waiting to be painted and a realm of pure mind in which those things can still be any colour. A pigment of our imagination In a sense, this endless deck of dyes bursting into the middle of Duchamp’s painting is a Tarot of tincture, prescient of how things could eventually appear in an ideal world, not as they actually are. Though Duchamp’s tiles are merely a prophecy of hue, they seem somehow more real and urgent in his painting than the shadowy shapes of the hat stand, bicycle wheel, and corkscrew whose space they intersect cosmically, as if from another universe. The years and decades that followed Duchamp’s final painting witnessed a succession of works by modern and contemporary artists that wrestle with and absorb the implications of his mischievous slicing of the mere idea of colour from the fact of physical form. Where proponents of colour theories of the 19th Century, such as those by the German Romantic Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and by the French chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul, are concerned with how colours are perceived by the human retina, the disciples of Duchamp became obsessed instead with colour as a commercialised concept – a pigment of their imagination. At the same moment that descendants of post-Impressionism and the early pioneers of Expressionism were formulating quasi-scientific manifestos for how colour functions in the eyes of those who encounter their work, Duchamp was laying his new-fangled cards on the table: colour is an aspirational commodity – a property to be found, not an emotion to be felt. Titians of industry Suddenly, two philosophies of colour found themselves competing for artistic regard – one that understood it as a traditional tool of the craftsman to be soulfully mastered, the other that saw it as an artificial aspect of soullessly manufactured goods. That clash of sensibilities was perhaps most dramatically illustrated by the near-simultaneous appearance in 1963 of two very different kinds of publication. It was the year that the German-born American artist Josef Albers released his still-influential visual treatise, Interaction of Colour, which provides complex ruminations on the harmony of hues – a system that continues to be taught to this day. It is also the year that Pantone published its encyclopaedic compendium of subtle shades – a volume that appeared to prove the dominion of industry over the empire of conceivable colours. The sway over artistic imagination in the 20th Century of the Pantone colour-matching system, and its precursors in the pigment charts distributed by companies such as DuPont, is impossible to overstate. Their influence can be traced in the works of generations of artists from Andy Warhol to Damien Hirst, Ellsworth Kelly to Gerhard Richter. But if Duchamp’s echelon of mechanical colour stretches prophetically forward in time to the obsessions of everyone from the Pop Artists to the YBAs, it also stretches back in history to the preoccupations of one of the most extraordinary, and extraordinarily neglected, books ever created. Long forgotten until its rediscovery in recent years by Medieval and Renaissance scholars,Klaer lightende Spiegel der Verfkonstis an 800-page handwritten and hand-illustrated volume from 1692 that seeks not only to illustrate every conceivable shade of watercolour possible, but to explain how to create them. An obsessive-compulsive recipe book for concocting the subtlest variations of tint, the book is the brainchild, according to the title page, of ‘A. Boogert’ – a Dutch hustler of hues about whom nothing else is known. Boogert’s book, which the inscrutable author says was intended to assist artists, came to the attention by accident of a Dutch Medievalist and blogger who was conducting research on the online databases of the Bibliothèque Méjanes in Aix-en-Provence, France, in 2014. Erik Kwakkel’s decision to feature the vibrant volume on his popular scholarly blog, and to provide links to a high-resolution scan ofthe entire book, helped propel the lexicon of luminosity into wider recognition than the single-surviving copy could ever have enjoyed in the author’s own lifetime. To click through the digitised pages of the book and watch the hundreds of abutting tiles flick into a shuffled blur of calibrated colour is to find oneself enacting the geometric drama of Duchamp’s pivotal final painting. Speaking to each other across centuries, Boogert’s long-lost opus maximum and Duchamp’s underappreciated prophetic masterpiece reveal a perennial fascination with the mysterious disguises of life’s most elusive dimension: colour.

    "content": "Truly vibrant red was elusive for many years: until a mysterious dye was discovered in Mexico. Devon Van Houten Maldonado reveals how a crushed bug became a sign of wealth and status. Although scarlet is the colour of sin in the Old Testament, the ancient world’s elite was thirsty for red, a symbol of wealth and status. They spent fantastic sums searching for ever more vibrant hues, until Hernán Cortés and the conquistadors discovered an intoxicatingly saturated pigment in the great markets of Tenochtitlan, modern-day Mexico City. Made from the crushed-up cochineal insect, the mysterious dye launched Spain toward its eventual role as an economic superpower and became one of the New World’s primary exports, as a red craze descended on Europe.An exhibition at Mexico City’s Palacio de Bellas Artes museumreveals the far-reaching impact of the pigment through art history, from the renaissance to modernism. In medieval and classical Europe, artisans and traders tripped over each other in search of durable saturated colors and – in turn – wealth, amid swathes of weak and watery fabrics. Dyers guilds guarded their secrets closely and performed seemingly magical feats of alchemy to fix colours to wool, silk and cotton. They used roots and resins to create satisfactory yellows, greens and blues. The murex snail was crushed into a dye to create imperial purple cloth worth more than its weight in gold. But truly vibrant red remained elusive. For many years, the most common red in Europe came from the Ottoman Empire, where the ‘Turkey red’ process used the root of the rubia plant. European dyers tried desperately to reproduce the results from the East, but succeeded only partially, as the Ottoman process took months and involved a pestilent mix of cow dung, rancid olive oil and bullocks’ blood, according to Amy Butler Greenfield in her book,A Perfect Red. Dyers also used Brazilwood, lac and lichens, but the resulting colours were usually underwhelming, and the processes often resulted in brownish or orange reds that faded quickly. For royalty and elite, St John’s Blood and Armenian red (dating back as far as the 8th Century BCE, according to Butler Greenfield), created the most vibrant saturated reds available in Europe until the 16th Century. But, made from different varieties of Porphyrophora root parasites, their production was laborious and availability was scarce, even at the highest prices. Mesoamerican peoples in southern Mexico had started using the cochineal bug as early as 2000 BCE, long before the arrival of the conquistadors, according to Mexican textile expert Quetzalina Sanchez. Indigenous people in Puebla, Tlaxcala and Oaxaca had systems for breeding and engineering the cochineal bugs for ideal traits and the pigment was used to create paints for codices and murals, to dye cloth and feathers, and even as medicine. Cochineal in the New World When the conquistadors arrived in Mexico City, the headquarters of the Aztec empire, the red colour was everywhere. Outlying villages paid dues to their Aztec rulers in kilos of cochineal and rolls of blood-red cloth. “Scarlet is the colour of blood and the grana from cochineal achieved that [...] the colour always had a meaning, sometimes magic other times religious,” Sanchez told the BBC. Cortés immediately recognized the riches of Mexico, which he related in several letters to King Charles V. “I shall speak of some of the things I have seen, which although badly described, I know very well will cause such wonder that they will hardly be believed, because even we who see them here with our own eyes are unable to comprehend their reality,” wrote Cortés to the king. About the great marketplace of Tenochtitlan, which was “twice as large as that of Salamanca, he wrote, “They also sell skeins of different kinds of spun cotton in all colours, so that it seems quite like one of the silk markets of Granada, although it is on a greater scale; also as many different colours for painters as can be found in Spain and of as excellent hues.” First-hand accounts indicate that Cortés wasn’t overly smitten with cochineal, more concerned instead with plundering gold and silver. Back in Spain, the king was pressed to make ends meet and hold together his enormous dominion in relative peace, so, although he was at first unconvinced by the promise of America, he became fascinated by the exotic tales and saw in cochineal an opportunity to prop up the crown’s coffers. By 1523, cochineal pigment made its way back to Spain and caught the attention of the king who wrote to Cortés about exporting the dyestuff back to Europe, writes Butler. “Through absurd laws and decrees [the Spanish] monopolised the grana trade,” says Sanchez. “They obligated the indians to produce as much as possible.” The native Mesoamericans who specialised in the production of the pigment and weren’t killed by disease or slaughtered during the conquest were paid pennies on the dollar – while the Spaniards “profited enormously as intermediaries.” Red in art history Dye from the cochineal bug was ten times as potent as St John’s Blood and produced 30 times more dye per ounce than Armenian red, according to Butler. So when European dyers began to experiment with the pigment, they were delighted by its potential. Most importantly, it was the brightest and most saturated red they had ever seen. By the middle of the 16th Century it was being used across Europe, and by the 1570s it had become one of the most profitable trades in Europe – growing from a meagre “50,000 pounds of cochineal in 1557 to over 150,000 pounds in 1574,” writes Butler. In the Mexican Red exhibition at the Palacio de Bellas Artes, the introduction of cochineal red to the European palette is illustrated in baroque paintings from the beginning of the 17th Century, after the pigment was already a booming industry across Europe and the world. Works by baroque painters like Cristóbal de Villalpando and Luis Juárez, father of José Juárez, who worked their entire lives in Mexico (New Spain), hang alongside the Spanish-born Sebastián López de Arteaga and the likes of Peter Paul Rubens. López de Arteaga’s undated work The Incredulity of Saint Thomas pales in comparison to Caravaggio’s version of the same work, where St Thomas’s consternation and amazement is palpable in the skin of his furrowed forehead. But the red smock worn by Christ in López de Arteaga’s painting, denoting his holiness, absolutely pops off the canvas. Both artists employed cochineal, the introduction of which helped to establish the dramatic contrast that characterised the baroque style. A few steps away, a portrait of Isabella Brandt (1610) by Rubens shows the versatility of paint made from cochineal. The wall behind the woman is depicted in a deep, glowing red, from which she emerges within a slight aura of light. The bible in her hand was also rendered in exquisite detail from cochineal red in Rubens’ unmistakable mastery of his brush, which makes his subjects feel as alive as if they were in front of you. Moving forward toward modernism – it wasn’t until the middle of the 19th Century that cochineal was replaced by synthetic alternatives as the pre-eminent red dyestuff in the world – impressionist painters continued to make use of the heavenly red hues imported from Mexico. At the Palacio de Bellas Artes, works by Paul Gauguin, Auguste Renoir and Vincent van Gogh have all been analysed and tested positive for cochineal. Like Rubens, Renoir’s subjects seem to be alive on the canvas, but as an impressionist his portraits dissolved into energetic abstractions. Gauguin also used colour, especially red, to create playful accents, but neither compared to the saturation achieved by Van Gogh. His piece, The Bedroom (1888), on loan from the Art Institute of Chicago, puts a full stop on the exhibition with a single burning-hot spot of bright red. After synthetic pigments became popular, outside of Mexico, the red dye was mass-produced as industrial food colouring – its main use today. Yet while the newly independent Mexico no longer controlled the valuable monopoly on cochineal, it also got something back – the sacred red that had been plundered and proliferated by the Spanish. “In Europe, as has happened in many cases, the history of the original people of Mexico has mattered very little,” Sanchez told the BBC, but in Mexico “the colour continues to be associated with ancestral magic [and] protects those who wear attire dyed with cochineal.” If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to ourFacebookpage or message us onTwitter.

    "section": "arts",
    "content": "Released 40 years ago this month, Miloš Forman's best picture-winning Amadeus is often accused of historical inaccuracies – but the film's critics could be missing the point. When it premiered 40 years ago, Amadeus drew an initial wave of praise. A historical drama revolving around the rivalry between two composers, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri, it went on to win eight Oscars, including for best picture. Miloš Forman took home the best director prize, Peter Shaffer won for best adapted screenplay and both of the lead actors were nominated: F Murray Abraham, who played Salieri, beat Tom Hulce, who played Mozart. But in the years that followed, a backlash grew over what some people saw as Amadeus's litany of historical errors. An article in The Guardiandeclaredthat the fart jokes can't conceal how laughably wrong this is, and the BBCcommentedthat the film plays shamelessly fast and loose with historical fact. Salieri, critics noted, was nopious bachelor(as attested by his wife, eight children and mistress), and it's after all an odd kind of hateful rivalry when the real Mozart entrusted the musical education of his own son to Salieri. As for Mozart's lewd humor, that cheeky insouciance was actuallycommonplacein middle-class Viennese society. Most egregiously of all, world-famous Mozart was not dumped in anunmarked pauper's grave. If this is a homage to history, thecomplaintgoes, it's akin to Emperor Joseph II fumbling ineptly on the pianoforte and bungling every other note. But this kind of cavilling may be missing the point. Forman's aim for Amadeus can be seen as radically different from a typical biopic, and that was to use a fictionalised version of an epic clash between musical composers to allegorise the defining global rivalry of the mid-to-late 20th Century: the Cold War. Put simply, the film may have played fast and loose with 1784 because its real preoccupation was 1984. The film opens in Vienna in 1823. Grizzled court composer Salieri howls through a bolted chamber door that he has murdered Mozart, then slashes his own throat. Days later, as he convalesces in an asylum, a priest arrives to hear his confession. It doesn't disappoint. Salieri recounts that as boy he made a vow of chastity to God as an expression of gratitude for, as he sees it, ushering in the providential death of his father to clear the path for his musical development. Jump ahead some years, and Salieri is now an eminent composer in the court of Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones), where he eagerly awaits an introduction to musical prodigy Mozart. That eagerness curdles when he sees the man in the flesh – he turns out to be a lascivious vulgarian with an ear-splitting cackle. Convinced that God means to mock his own mediocrity, Salieri hurls a crucifix in the fire and vows retaliation. When Mozart's father dies, Salieri seizes on the misfortune with a dastardly stratagem: dupe Mozart into believing that his father has risen from the grave to commission him to write a requiem, then murder him and pass off the masterpiece as his own. Mozart, feverish and besotted with drink, dies, leaving Salieri addled with bitterness and destined for obscurity. The premise wasn't original to Forman. Drawing inspiration from Alexander Pushkin's taut 1830 play Mozart and Salieri, Peter Shaffer wrote a highly stylised play called Amadeus, which premiered in London in 1979. Forman, sitting in on a preview, was entranced by the dramatic rivalry and convinced Shaffer to collaborate with him, not merely to adapt the play for the screen but to demolish the original, then totally reimagine it as a film. Across four irascible monthscloisteredin a Connecticut farmhouse with Shaffer, Forman fundamentally rebuilt the narrative with a fresh palette of political resonances. The casting process for the coveted roles of Mozart and Salieri rivaledGone with the Windin scope and behind-the-scenes intrigue, all of which played out over a year and involved meetings with literallythousands of actors. Kenneth Branagh was nearly victorious in landing Mozart, then got dropped from consideration when Forman pivoted to a US cast. Mark Hamillenduredgrueling hours of auditions, only to be told by Forman: No one is believing that the Luke Skywalker is the Mozart. Al Pacino lobbied hard for the part of Salieri, in competition with Mick Jagger, Burt Reynolds, Donald Sutherland and Sam Waterson. In the end, Forman eschewed splashy celebrities for Hulce and Abraham, only to have casting drama explode again when Meg Tilly, slated to play Mozart's wife, Constanze, broke her ankle playing football: she was replaced by Elizabeth Berridge a week before shooting was to commence. With the plot rebuilt and the cast in place, more than one rivalry was poised to come into focus. The Czech-born Forman had been a galvanising force behind the Czechoslovakian New Wave film movement in the 1960s, reaching a climax with his 1967 film The Firemen's Ball, which satirised the absurd inefficiencies of Eastern European communism. The film was initially warmly received within the reformist milieu of the Prague Spring, but whenSoviet tanksrolled into Prague the following year and organised Czechoslovakia into the Eastern bloc, Forman, tarred as a traitor to the state, was forced to flee to the West and found refuge in the US. Nearly all of Forman's film work thereafter would show glimmers of opposition to Soviet-style censorship, confinement, and concentrated power. His first success in the US, for example, 1975'sOne Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, depicted a mental health ward meting out cruelty and coercion to patients under the guise of benevolent care. Audiences barely needed to squint to see the asylum as gulag andNurse Ratchedas the embodiment of the drunk-on-power Soviet bureaucrat. Likewise, Forman's 1996 film, The People vs Larry Flynt, depicted thefounder of Hustler magazinesquaring off against censorship at the cost of being jailed, locked up at a psychiatric facility and paralysed by an assassin's bullet. The Soviet allegory can certainly be applied to Amadeus. Perhaps Forman was less concerned with hewing to biographical facts as he was with presenting Mozart as a beleaguered type of ecstatic genius who, hostage to patronage, is stifled and finally crushed by the repressive apparatus of the state. Joseph II, absolute ruler of the Habsburg monarchy, is advised at court by a clutch of prudish sycophants who undermine Mozart's achievements and smear his reputation. Whatever its loose correspondence to the late-18th and early-19th Centuries, this critique can be read as a stab at the USSR – a debilitatingly centralised bureaucracy hostile to insurgent ideas and innovation. But Forman showed that Mozart would get the last laugh. By the events of 1823, Salieri's insipid, state-sponsored melodies have all been forgotten, while a few bars of Mozart draw immediate joy to the priest's face. In the free market of popular tastes, Salieri's mandated drivel has been suffocated by the triumph of genius. In Forman's hands, the Habsburg Empire bears the hallmarks of Soviet power. The masquerade balls, with their bewildering swirl of masked identities, conjure the confusion and paranoia that proliferated under the Soviet system. Salieri's reluctant servant-spy (Cynthia Nixon) carries out covert surveillance, a nod to the 20th Century's KGB, which had thousands of its moles burrow into the private lives of artists and dissidents. Meanwhile, Salieri's heretical burning of the crucifix and war on God call to mind the ideological struggle between a Christian worldview and secular Soviet hubris. (After Abraham's mother – a pious Italian woman – saw the cross-burning scene, she browbeat her son so relentlessly that he blurted out what he now tells the BBC was a lie: I told her, 'mum, that was an extra – somebody else threw it in there!') And then there's the mass grave into which Mozart's corpse is dumped. This depiction does not fit the facts of what is known about his death, but it makes sense if read as an indictment of Soviet practices – the effacement of individual identity and literal mass murder.Grim excavationsof these pits continue to this day. Forman, whose own parents perished in Nazi concentration camps, understood the power of this imagery. Jeff Smith, author of Film Criticism, the Cold War, and the Blacklist, tells the BBC that Mozart's struggle against the status quo tapped into Forman's own frustrations with Soviet censorship. The emperor's fatuous judgment about Mozart's opera–'too many notes'–is just the kind of accusation that was used as a cudgel used against avant-garde artists and thinkers to imply their work isn't pleasant or edifying to Soviet ears. Mozart's enraged incredulity in that scene must have mirrored Forman's own longstanding contempt for Soviet stagnation and repression. Shooting took place in 1983 over a six-month period in Prague, which had the virtue of offering basilicas, palaces and cobblestone squares virtually unchanged since the late 18th Century. Even with Soviet power waning, however, Czechoslovakia remained part of the Eastern bloc and Forman was still persona non grata, so adealwas struck: the director would refrain from meeting with political dissidents, and the regime would allow friends of Forman to visit with their repatriated prodigal son. Forman's own recollections from the shoot centred on the travails of Soviet interference. His landlady warned his phone is bugged. Informers lurked in every room. Two unmarked cars tailed him everywhere, which seemed redundant since his own driver was also a secret agent. In his autobiography, Turnaround, Forman is just shy of explicit about the degree to which themes of Soviet repression leaked into Amadeus. As it had to be in the socialist Prague, he wrote, the spirit of Franz Kafka presided over our production.  Perhaps even more telling is a story he recounts of negotiating with the general director of Czechoslovak film, Jiří Purš, who, as Forman recounted, wanted absolute assurance that the Communist Party would have nothing to fear: I assume that politically there is nothing in the script that they could hang their hats on? Forman's reply is a model of plausible deniability and acid irony: Look, it's about Mozart! More like this: •The cinema classic that made Clint Eastwood a star •The real California scandal that led to Chinatown •The D-day film that changed how we see war F Murray Abraham felt the strain of coercive scrutiny as he was traveling back and forth to the United States to shoot his role in Scarface (1983) while Amadeus was in production in Prague. Abraham tells the BBC, At the end of every shooting day I had to cross the border to get to the airport in Vienna to return to Hollywood. At the checkpoint, the Czechoslovak Police would make us sit idle at the gate, just as a way to throw their weight around, make you know who's in charge. That sense of bullying and intimidation was everywhere, and even when the Czech people responded with subversive humor, the strain was palpable. We never forgot for a minute that we were under communist surveillance. That tension between the US crew and Soviet agents finally burst out into the open on 4 July. The production was shooting an opera scene, and the crew arranged so that when Forman yelled action a US flag unfurled and the national anthem played in lieu of Mozart's music. Some 500 Czech extras burst forth into emotional song, in effect revealing their sympathies with the West. But not all of them. Forman recalled, All stood up – except 30 men and women, panic on their face, looking at each other [asking] what they should do. They were the secret police, dispersed among the extras. As Amadeus continues to be reassessed at its 40th anniversary, the significance of the Cold War looms ever larger. Paul Frazier, author of The Cold War on Film, tells the BBC that the film brilliantly tapped into a deep vein of Soviet envy: Salieri is the Soviet Lada trying to be a Ford Mustang. He can't be as great as Mozart, so he resorts to undermining and manipulating him. This too was the approach of the old USSR towards the West: rather than being better than the West, the Soviets resorted to undermining and discrediting the West at every turn. Historian Nicholas J Cull echoes that analysis. Think of the Jonathan Swift line: 'When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him.' Whether it's the 1780s or 1980s, what you have is true genius facing off against mediocre, conniving bureaucrats. You see this same dynamic at play in a Cold War film like last summer'sOppenheimer, which in some ways is Amadeus with A-bombs. It makes sense that refugee film-makers like Forman and his creative team would be drawn to tell an allegory of communist mismanagement. Not everyone is sold on the idea that Amadeus wrestles with Soviet totalitarianism. Kevin Hagopian, a media studies professor at Penn State University, says there's a risk of allegorising everything as an unseen Soviet menace, which ends up making art a mere handmaid to politics. That ultimately becomes a depressingly narrow way to appreciate the dazzling beauty and emotional breadth of Mozart's music, Hagopian tells the BBC. Nevertheless, he adds, we can't ignore the political resonances. The allegorical space that satirical Czech film-makers like Forman opened up meant that audiences began to look for, even perhaps invent, allegorical political meaning, he says. All films could be read against the grain of a regime that lacked not only humanity but any sense of irony about itself. So if Amadeus wasn't really about Soviet-style tyranny, but audiences merely thought it was, well, I have a feeling that would be just fine with Miloš Forman. For his part, Abraham is candid about what he believes are the more contemporary political stakes of the film, as he told the BBC in June. Think about how many Americans now idolise Putin. These autocrats are suddenly celebrated again. It's disheartening, truly demoralising, but if Amadeus can help us see our current predicament through fresh eyes, that shows you how powerfully its message still resonates. -- If you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

    "content": "From a 17th-Century Italian violin stolen from Japan to Drake's lost Blackberry in Mexico, here are musical lost and found mysteries that rival Sir Paul McCartney's. In musical happy endings, last week, Sir Paul McCartney wasreunited with his bass guitarthat was stolen 51 years ago in London. The instrument, which McCartney purchased in 1961, was subsequently nabbed from a band van in 1972. Now, thanks to theLost Bass search project, the Beatle has been reunited with the bass, which had been until recently stashed in a Sussex attic. Both McCartney and Höfner, the instrument manufacturer, authenticated the found item upon its rediscovery, and a spokesperson for McCartney told BBC News he was incredibly grateful for the return of his lost guitar. More like this: But McCartney certainly isn't the only musician to lose a valuable piece of his kit – in fact, he's not even the only Beatle. And for non-Beatles-level musical acts, the loss of an instrument – or worse, an entire kit – can be devastating. The BBC previously reported on the theft of rock bandCemetery Sun's entire kitand van, as well as trioNoisy's stolen kit reappearingwith individual instruments and pieces of gear up for auction online weeks later. Bassist Grant Emerson of Americana band Delta Rae recalls having around $10,000 (£7,937) of musical instruments stolen: We played at the Bitter End in New York City and parked our van down the street. When we came back to the van, the back door had been broken into, and all of our guitars were gone, plus a pedal board and a piece of the drummer's equipment. Probably four to five pieces of gear were stolen. It was a really terrible drive back to North Carolina. He notes that for most bands, the only recourse is fundraising: You just rely on your fans. You ask for help and donations, which isn't easy. And he urges all musicians to photograph the serial number of every instrument and piece of gear you own. Lost or stolen instruments over the years have kept musicians and fans alike searching for guitars, violins, and even an entire brass band. Here are a few more musical mysteries – some of which remain unsolved to this day. The famous blues legend was known for riffs on his legendary guitar, a Gibson he named Lucille – in fact, King had multiple performance guitars named Lucille over the course of his career. The name was inspired by a lover’s quarrel King witnessed in 1949 (the woman arguing was named Lucille, and she left quite an impression on King). When this particular Lucille guitar was stolen, it was eventually found in a Las Vegas pawn shop byEric Dahl, a fellow musician who mistakenly purchased the guitar and later returned it to King. Dahl offered it without compensation and went on to write a book about King and his many guitars. The Gibson also ended up being one of the last instruments King played before his death in 2015, and it was subsequently sold at his estate auction for $280,000 (£222,286) in 2019. Clapton's Gibson Les Paul guitar, named Beano, was stolen soon after his studio album Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton was released in 1966. Unlike King, Clapton hasn't been so lucky as to be reunited with his lost guitar – yet. But singer-songwriter JoeBonamassa has claimed he knows where it is: In 2016, Bonamassa gave an interview in which he said the guitar was in a private US collection, which spurred a 2018petitionto encourage Bonamassa to reveal more details. On theirYouTube channel, music aficionados Baxter and Jonathan of North Carolina-based Casino Guitars joked that they imagine a guitar illuminati trading in lost and rare instruments might not be pleased with what Bonamassa has already shared so far – and pondered whether he has a responsibility to help Clapton retrieve the stolen item if he does, in fact, know where it is. A violin made in 1675 by Nicolo Amati in Italy was stolen in 2005 from the home of Japanese violinist Takiko Omura, who had purchased the instrument in the United States many decades earlier. The violin, whichwas priced at nearly £300,000($377,895) in 2005 when it was taken, wasreportedly found in 2020in Parma, Italy, in the raid of a home of a suspected drug trafficker. Authorities in Italy and Japan worked together to return the instrument to its rightful owner. It's difficult enough to find one lost guitar, let alone an entire brass band. In 2022, a famouslocal New Orleans second line brass band had all their equipment stolen from their vanduring the worst possible time for them – two weeks beforeNew Orleans Jazz Fest. Nearly $12,000 (£9,526) in musical instruments, including cymbals, drum sets, keyboards and amps, were stolen when the band's van disappeared from outside the home of a band member. The theft threatened to derail the Stooges' festival appearance that year, but the band is back on its feet, with ascheduled appearance on 28 April at this year's Jazz Fest. As the BBC has previously reported, the violin prodigy Min Kym's Stradivarius was stolen in 2010 from a Pret a Manger restaurant. This wasno ordinary violinistand no ordinary violin: At just seven years old, Kym had earned a slot at the prestigious Purcell School of Music in the UK, and at age 11, she won first prize at the Premier Mozart International Competition. When presented with the opportunity to own a rare 1696 Stradivarius, Kym remortgaged her flat and bought the violin for £450,000 ($580,000). If this seems like an astronomical amount of money, it was in fact a steal in Stradivarius terms: the violin's actual worth was closer to £1.2m ($1.5m) and these instruments are so precious that their value only ever goes up,” reads the 2017 article about the crime. Although the stolen violin was eventuallyrecovered three years later, it wasnot returned to Kym, and her memoir, Gone: A Girl, A Violin, A Life Unstrung, tells the story of coping with a musical instrument being lost and found and then lost again. Sir Paul wasn't even the only Beatle whose beloved instrument was absconded with: George Harrison's 1965 Rickenbacker guitar wasallegedly stolen in 1966. Rickenbacker CEO John Hall told Reverb that the guitar's mystery has been so longstanding because no one knows the exact serial number of the original guitar. The Rickenbacker team were, however, able to narrow the list down to five potential guitars based on shipment dates. Harrison also had his '57 Les Paul, Lucy – which was formerly owned by the Lovin' Spoonful's John Sebastian, Rick Derringer, and Eric Clapton – stolen. It was nabbed fromHarrison's homeduring a burglary in 1973 and then sold to a Los Angeles music store who, in turn, sold it to Mexican musician Miguel Ochoa, who declined to sell it back to Harrison at full price. Instead, Ochoa negotiated a trade with Harrison: Harrison got Lucy back, and Ochoa would get a 1958 Les Paul Standard and a Fender Precision bass. In his 2009 song Say What's Real, produced by Kanye West, Drake revealed that he lost some of his best lyrics in Mexico: Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo/So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll, he raps, followed by an expletive-laden line that finishes the rhyme. For his genre of music, that Blackberry was his instrument, which heused to pen his songs. While it doesn't sound like it's ever been returned, Drake has probably upgraded his tech.

    "section": "arts",
    "content": "Many opera companies are working towards full sustainability, and Glyndebourne is among those aiming to be a force for good, according to a new documentary. A night at the opera is not typically equated with restraint, instead conjuring images of chandelier-filled theatres and arias performed in exquisite costumes against transportative stage sets. Yet, recent years have seen opera companies across the globe make a determined effort to operate more sustainably, implementing numerous strategies in a bid to reduce their carbon emissions and overall impact on the planet. More like this: -How opera can be 'open to everyone' -The nation that is the 'land of song' -Gen Z and millennials' surprising obsession This is, in part, the result of climate activists, who have increasingly targeted the arts and entertainment industries over the past few years with the aim of drawing greater attention to their cause. At the end of 2022, for instance, responding to mounting protests, the Royal Opera Housecut tieswith its long-time sponsor, the oil giant BP. Yet, it is also a response to the shifting expectations of audience members: according to aUK studyconducted in 2022, 77% of audience members now expect theatres to address the climate emergency in their work – and opera houses are no exception. The pandemic, while posing innumerable difficulties for the live entertainment industry, also offered an important pause for reflection. It was during this time that a number of UK theatre-makers joined forces with sustainability experts to conceive theTheatre Green Book, a publication setting a common standard for sustainable theatre production, and providing guidance on how best to achieve it. Divided into three volumes – sustainable productions, sustainable buildings and sustainable operations – spanning the many facets of what it means to run a theatre, the acclaimed guide has already been widely implemented. A key collaborator in the creation of the Theatre Green Book was the historic East Sussex opera house Glyndebourne, renowned for its summer festival which draws thousands of opera lovers to the stately home's verdant grounds each year. Glyndebourne has been forging a path towards greater sustainability in opera for some time. Art, opera, nature [has always been] a core trinity for Glyndebourne, explains its archivist Phil Boot in a new BBC documentaryTake Me to The Opera: The Power of Glyndebourne.  In 2012, executive chairman Gus Christie oversaw the installation of a 67m (220ft)-tall wind turbine on a hill adjacent to the opera house, which between then and 2022 has generated the equivalent of 102% of the electricity used by the company in the same period. The turbine serves as an important statement of intent for Glyndebourne. Alison Tickell, the founder and chief executive of Julie's Bicycle, a non-profit organisation dedicated to mobilising the UK arts and culture sectors in a fight against climate change, says in the documentary: I know that many opera companies… don't have the luxury of space. But [the turbine] still remains a beacon for us all [demonstrating] that climate action really matters. Glyndebourne has innovated in sustainable practice in the years since. In 2021, it joined the globalRace to Zero, pledging to halve its direct carbon emissions by 2030, and to reach net zero by 2050. We are zero waste to landfill now, so any waste we have goes down to [an] incinerator, which provides power for local homes, Christie says of some of the measures he and his team have taken to achieve this. We compost all our garden waste, we recycle as much of our stage-set material, costumes, props [as we can]. We have about 32 electric vehicle charging points [for visitors] which are all charged from the wind turbine. They are drawing from their resources in other ways, too: by the end of this year, they predict, all water served at Glyndebourne will come from the property's own natural spring, while plants grown in their gardens are being used to produce dyes for the company's costumes. Rivers around the world are polluted by dyes a lot, says dye room supervisor Jenny Mercer in the documentary. This way everything goes back into the ground. Climate action Glyndebourne isn't the only opera company taking steps towards sustainability. It is now usual among major opera houses, from the English National Opera to Opéra National de Paris, to boast a dedicated webpage outlining their sustainability mission statements, including pledges to adhere to the UN sustainable development goals, facts and figures relating to their reduced energy consumption and carbon emissions, and details of their own planet-friendly solutions. The rooftop of the Opéra Bastille, for example, is host to anurban farm, cultivated using agroecology, which also contributes to the thermal insulation of the building. This produces around a hundred weekly baskets of fruit and vegetables that are then sold to staff and local residents. The Sydney Opera House – a longstanding champion of environmental consciousness that achieved carbon neutrality in 2018 – has installed an artificial reef alongside the iconic building's sea wall, encouraging marine biodiversity and supporting Sydney Harbour's native species. Most recently, the opera house was awarded a six-star performance rating by the Green Building Council of Australia, the highest possible ranking. This is no mean feat given that perhaps the biggest challenge facing opera is achieving energy efficiency within its decades-, if not centuries-old, buildings. Indeed, in 2021,a survey by the UK's Theatres Trustfound that it would cost more than £1bn ($1.2bn) to make the UK's theatre buildings sustainable. In the meantime, many companies have been looking to achieve sustainability through new buildings, while doing what they can to reduce waste in their pre-existing spaces. The Royal Opera House's production workshop just outside London, built in 2015, is in the top 10% of sustainable non-domestic buildings in the UK. While Milan's storied opera house La Scala's new office is a zero-energy building, producing more energy than it consumes thanks to rooftop solar panels and an open-cycle geothermal system. La Scala has also cut its carbon emissions by more than  630 tonnes since 2010, according to a recentNew York Times article, having upgraded to LED and smart lighting. Elsewhere, the Opéra de Lyon, Göteborg Opera and Tunis Opera are currently partnered on anew projectinvestigating how best to implement the circular economy of production materials, while Leeds' Opera North is soon to launch its first green season, using shared set design across its three productions, recycled or second-hand costumes, and including a new eco-entertainment work titled Masque of Might. As the Theatres Trust's study shows, there is still a long way to go, and a lot of money required, to make the changes necessary to safeguard the future of opera amid the ever-worsening climate crisis, but there appears to be no shortage of determination and imagination among opera houses in their quest to do so.

    "section": "arts",
    "content": "Is the world of opera becoming more inclusive? A new documentary, featuring conductor Antonio Pappano, explores the mission to open up the art form to everyone. Conductor Sir Antonio Pappano is renowned for being a warm-hearted people person. But there's one thing that makes his blood run cold: when he hears opera being accused of being an art form that's only for a wealthy elite. I get very offended by people who say we're elitist, he says passionately in a new documentary. This is a misconception that totally distorts the image of opera, he adds. The fact of the matter is, it's harder to get into a football game in London than it is to get into the [Royal] Opera House. More like this: -The nation that is 'the land of song' -Eight of the most stunning opera houses -Gen Z and millennials' surprising obsession This allusion to the beautiful game is not a frivolous one. When Pappano  became music director at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden (ROH) in 2002, he spoke of his love for popular music by stars such as Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Oscar Peterson, Joni Mitchell, and for musicals. I like football too, he added. Does that mean you can't like opera? Back then Pappano was 42, and the youngest conductor to lead ROH's orchestra. Some 700 operas later –  with many productions of the French and Italian repertoires; a good part of the Russian; Wagner, Strauss and contemporary works – and he is the subject of A Time of Change, presented by Zeinab Badawi, and part of the BBC documentary seriesTake Me to the Opera. The documentary follows him from his modest roots, as the son of Italian immigrant parents who came from southern Italy to the UK, who worked hard to make ends meet.  They passed on their strong work ethic to him, and he learnt how to work with singers from his vocal coach father, flourishing as a musical talent in the the family business. A Time of Change goes on to trace a career that includes assisting classical pianist Daniel Barenboim, through to a recent high, conducting the King's coronation service in May, featuring solos byWelsh baritone Bryn Terfeland South African soprano Pretty Yende. The main focus of the film, though, is Pappano's mission to open up opera to everyone. Opera shouldn't cater just to one audience, or be focused on just one corner of the repertoire, he says. It must be open to the interests of many different people. While he asserts that the ROH, like every big opera house, wants to entice young audiences, he does concede: I think you have to be honest and say, yes, but younger people can't afford very expensive tickets, can they? It's true that the price of opera tickets can seem too high to be anything but a rare luxury for most, especially young people. Halley Bondy, writing on the arts websitePaste Magazine, describes herself as someone who has been to the opera many times for a millennial. And although she loves opera – from the hyper-real grandness to the unbelievable talent, to the septuagenarian, fur-hatted audience – she finds it easy to see why places like The Met [Metropolitan Opera House in NYC] are ailing in sales; young people just don't go. It's too expensive, too arcane, too massive… The onus is on the opera houses to do a better job of catering to the young. Bondy has only managed to attend so often by being treated by a ridiculously generous friend or chasing discounted tickets. Like everything else in the world, the opera is a lot of fun if you have gobs of money, she observes, but she concedes anyone could get in with the $25 [£19.40] rush tickets, student tickets or commercial offers – which make it affordable, if you just dig a little. In opera's defence, ticket prices are generally high because it is notoriously costly to produce. All the more reason, argued The Guardian's Charlotte Higgins in February, for adequate government funding. Discussing recentcuts to opera funding, she wrote: If you starve something, run it down constantly, gradually reduce the provision of it so that few can afford it, it becomes 'elitist'… And if opera in the form that its creators imagine it becomes for toffs, that is nothing to do with opera itself… [it is] precisely the result of neglect and underfunding. Pappano is also invested in bringing new blood to opera, via schemes like the ROH's  schools matinees, which offer young people low-cost tickets to opera productions. Also, its Youth Opera talent development programme gives children aged seven to 13 the chance to try its rigorous music and drama training. We make sure there's a real variety of socio-economic backgrounds and ethnicities, and an even gender split,” says Tom Floyd, ROH senior opera manger, talking about its open recruitment system. Most of the young people who join them come from families who probably have had no real experience of opera, he says. Opera for all Over at English National Opera (ENO), the company has stayed true to its egalitarian roots of the late 19th-Century, when theatrical producer Lilian Baylis and music director Charles Corri shared a vision of it as a place for people's opera. ENO has opera for all in its mission statement. It does not assume knowledge of opera; its website has  key figures of the organisation  explaining what opera is and how it's made; and  the site hints at how it skillfully reimagines crowd pleasers, like La Traviata (to be performed this October), in thrilling new ways, alongside daring new work, such as 7 Deaths of Maria Callas, by performance artist Marina Abramovich (November). We sing in English to be accessible to the widest possible audience, an ENO spokesperson tells BBC Culture. The company offers free tickets for under-21s; discounts for under 35s, and tickets from £10 for all. No surprise, then, that more than half its bookings last season were from opera first-timers. Still, in order to survive the cuts to Arts Council England (ACE) funding, the ENO will next yearmove its main basefrom the London Coliseum to outside the capital and in so doing will  qualify for £24m funding over three years. Opera must change, ACE chief executiveDarren Henley wrotein an article for The Guardian: A new generation is embracing opera and music presented in new ways: opera in car parks… in pubs, opera on your tablet. In truth, most opera companies are not digital-age dodgers; they have presences on the popular digital platforms, while the hashtag #operaisopen invites new audiences to click through. Streaming services –  like Royal Opera Stream and Glyndebourne Encore – have dished up productions and events, both popular and esoteric, to reach a wider audience. And there's also opera at the cinema. At ROH, 2022/23 has been its biggest cinema season ever, with more than 1,300 cinemas worldwide having shown or showing 13 productions (opera and ballet), including Madam Butterfly, La Boheme and Aida. The latter, staged in May and June 2023, was conducted by Pappano. Nurturing promising young talent – like soprano Masabane Cecilia Rangwanasha – is a passion of Pappano’s, and he's also a role model for young opera conductors, like Avishka Ederisinghe, who says that watching him talking on YouTube was what inspired him to explore the art form. As he steps down from his music director roles – at the Academy of Santa Cecilia in Rome after 18 years, and at ROH next summer, after 22 years – Pappano is looking forward to change. He will not be hanging up the baton yet: he will succeed Simon Rattle to become chief conductor at the London Symphony Orchestra, his dream job. He describes how he grew up in a council flat that was just a four-minute walk to Westminster Abbey; and that rising from his humble background to conducting the coronation at that same abbey was not a bad gig. Jokes aside, there is a message there that  he'd love to hand down to a younger generation: If you have a vision for what you want to achieve in life, that spark and… the energy and resilience to keep pushing when you know things will get tough, you can make it in any walk of life.

    "content": "Opera star Bryn Terfel emerged from an extraordinary cultural heritage and a nation renowned for its love of singing. It's the air that we breathe, he explains in a new documentary. Sir Bryn Terfel is pondering a question: what is it about Wales and the Welsh that produces a nation of singers? I think it's the mountains, and the fresh sea air. And the language – that is very important, he says. Then there's the hymns… You know, we just love to sing – it's the air that we breathe. More like this: -Eight of the most stunning opera houses -The extraordinary'lost'opera composer -Gen Z and millennials'surprising obsession The Welsh bass-baritone is the subject ofPeak Performance, part of the BBC documentary series Take Me to the Opera. Presented by Zeinab Badawi, it follows Sir Bryn – as he has been known since his knighthood in 2017 – from his operatic debut with the Welsh National Opera in 1990, to singing at opera houses across the world, like London's Royal Opera House, where he is a regular star performer. En route, the documentary revisits his roots in rural Wales and looks at how he's nurturing the next generations of singing talent, as well as his invitation to sing at King Charles's coronation. Sir Bryn is high on the list of great living Welsh opera singers, which also includes luminaries such as Dame Gwyneth Jones, Wynne Evans, Katherine Jenkins, and Aled Jones. (Added to which there are many popular non-opera Welsh singers, including Tom Jones, Shirley Bassey,Bonnie Tyler, Charlotte Church and Cerys Matthews.) But beyond these headline stars lies a whole nation renowned for its love of singing, especially choral. So where does this passion for song stem from? In A History of Music and Singing in Wales, novelist and poet Wyn Griffith, who wrote extensively on Wales and Welsh culture, observed: If you find a score of Welsh people, in Wales or out of it, you will find a choir. They sing for their own delight, and they always sing in harmony. They sing as naturally and easily as they talk. Wales is known as a nation of music – the 'land of song', notes the Welsh National Opera (WNO). Often connected with male voice choirs, it is… recognised for its choral traditions which are rooted in the culture. Choral singing in Wales dates back to the 19th Century, and flourished with the Cymanafa Ganu (hymn singing) movement, at a chapel in Aberdare in 1859; it was rooted mainly in religious songs, though a steady body of secular songs were also produced. Soon after, a revival of traditional Welsh music began with the formation of the National Eisteddfod Society, a focus for the Welsh passion for singing and song. Any worthy list of classic Welsh songs might include Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau (O Land of My Fathers); My Little Welsh Home by William Sidney Gwynn Williams; and the love song Ar Lan y Mor (recorded by both Terfel and Jenkins). Or the rousing We'll Keep a Welcome (In the Hillsides). The male voice choir, along with the harp, are two of the most popular signifiers of Welsh music. Professor Gareth Williamstraces the male voice choir's originsto the mid-19th Century industrial age: We are reminded of what Aneurin Bevan once said: 'Culture comes off the end of a pick', he writes, referring to Welsh coal miners. Choirs started in the 1920s, like Cwbach from the Cynon Valley, and Pendyrus, survive today. After a day's hard graft in a mine, says Williams, the joy and community found in singing with co-workers was an assertion of working-class male bonding and identity expressed through that most democratic and inexpensive instrument, the human voice. The Welsh Borough Chapel in Southwark, London, is host to Eschoir, a Welsh male choir of around 20 singers, aged 20 to 75. Singing together since 2009, they've performed at Buckingham Palace, 10 Downing Street, and the Six Nations rugby tournament. Eschoir founder and director Mike Williams, who grew up in south Wales, describes their appeal: There's a humility to it, as Welsh choirs stem back to the coal mines and chapels. Many people enjoy singing in the pub as much as singing in a concert. There is no pomp… it unites us and keeps us connected to our Welsh roots. And the Welsh take choirs very seriously, he adds. In tandem with a passion for choral singing in Wales, there has been a rise in popularity of the Eisteddfod. These Welsh singing and recital competitions date back to the 12th Century and today are a platform for public singing, especially for younger singers. It was at local Eisteddfods that the young Bryn Terfel first stood out, winning singing competitions that would lead him to study at Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and to his first professional role in Cosi Fan Tutti at Welsh National Opera, soon after graduating in 1989. A unique cultural inheritance In the documentary, Terfel recalls competing in Eisteddfods in his rural north Wales, and how his parents paid for a lot of petrol to drive me north, south, east and west to compete. They saw something in their son… the passion, how I loved singing. I think that drove them to encourage the singing within me. Eisteddfods are a wonderful shop window, he says. One of his charitable initiatives is a scholarship to develop promising young performers coming up through Eisteddfods. Peak Performance visits one in Llanadog, near Swansea, as young singers of all genders, from the area and across Wales, prepare to get on stage and sing. This is where it all starts for us Welsh singers, says one teenage boy in the documentary. This is where we learn our craft. He believes when Welsh singers go to London to study, you can see the difference… they’ve got some sort of… confidence. Certainly, Terfel was swaddled in song and music from the cradle. Born in 1967 in rural north Wales, his father was a farmer, his mother a special needs teacher who used music therapy in her work. The whole family, including older relatives, sang together and in choirs. My grandfather, my great-grandfather, had the love of singing, he says. There was constant learning going on in the kitchen, words on the cabinets. A little bit of rivalry as well, which is quite healthy. Eilir Owen Griffiths, a composer and Eisteddfod adjudicator, explains what he looks for in a great singer: It's how the voice resonates, and the way it works with text. He describes Terfil's voice as like a beautiful double bass – but it's not just the incredible sound he generates: It's also the control he has – he can sing the most delicate pianissimo as well. It's a unique voice, very special. That quality – and cultural diversity – was drawn on when Sir Bryn sang at the coronation of King Charles, who personally chose him to perform; he sang Coronation Kyrie, a first in the Welsh language at a coronation. You have the rehearsals in the rooms… Then you have your fittings, and all of a sudden you're in your costume and make-up. And you're onstage, he says, portraying a character. And that's when the fun reallydoesbegin! The documentary joins Terfel as he goes through his repertoire for a week in March: as well as the Barber of Seville at the Royal Opera House, he sings the title role in Puccini's Gianni Schicchi at the Philharmonic Hall, Liverpool; then travels to a studio near Cardiff in Wales, to record an album of sea shanties – the likes of Drunken Sailor, and traditional folk songs like Fflat Huw Puw, about a sailor and his wonderful ship. It's a voice that continues to thrill audiences, whether in lead roles such as Mozart’s Don Giovanni at the Royal Opera House; or Tosca by Puccini at Paris Opera Bastille; or Verdi's Falstaff, at Grange Park Opera, Surrey. As well as big opera houses, he performs for new audiences in concert halls too. Gillian Moore is artistic director of the South Bank Centre, where in recent months he sang extracts from two of Wagner's great roles: The fact he's passing that on to young singers makes total sense… When he's on stage, you cannot take your eyes off him. Returning to that question of why the Welsh love to sing, Wyn Griffith suggests it's about an irrepressible spirit – and it's simply in the blood: Whether they meet in tens or in thousands, in a small country chapel or in a vast assembly… they sing freely… It is not necessary to organise singing in Wales: it happens on its own.

    "section": "arts",
    "content": "A radical new wave of artists are sweeping the previously elite world of classical music – with a little help from Squid Game, Dark Academia and fashion. Daisy Woodward explores how classical got cool. If asked to guess what under 25-year-olds are listening to, it's unlikely that many of us would land upon orchestral music. And yeta survey published in December 2022by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO) found that 74% of UK residents aged under 25 were likely to be tuning into just that at Christmas-time, compared with a mere 46% of people aged 55 or more. These figures reflect not only the RPO'sbroader findingthat under 35-year-olds are more likely to listen to orchestral music than their parents, but also the widespread surge in popularity of classical music in general, particularly among younger generations. More like this: -The radical trend millennials love -The forgotten Soviet genius of music -Have film and TV got Gen Z all wrong? There are plenty of reasons for this, from the playlist culture spawned by streaming platforms that make it easy for listeners to discover new artists and types of music to fit their mood, to the solace it provided during the pandemic, not to mention the profusion of classical music in pop culture hits like Squid Game. But perhaps highest on the list is the global wave of Gen Z and young millennial classical artists who are finding new ways to be seen and heard, and – just as vitally – new means of modernising what has long been branded music's most elite and stuffy genre. Unsurprisingly, social media has played a huge part in this, as a quick search of the popular TikTok hashtag classictok (currently at 53.8 million views) attests. There, as well as on Instagram, young classical artists have been making use of the digital realm's democratic potential to lift the heavy velvet curtains on their art form, presenting classical music and its storied history in ways that are accessible, unintimidating and, most importantly, fun. For French violinistEsther Abrami– who has more than 250,000 followers on Instagram, more than 380,000 on TikTok, and was the first classical musician to be nominated in the Social Media Superstar category at the Global Awards – the journey to social media fame stemmed from a desire to share her passion more widely. I was studying at a top institution and most of the time I was practising for exams, so the whole joy of sharing was taken away. Then, at the very few concerts I did play, there was a very specific type of audience that wasn't very diverse, Abrami tells BBC Culture. She noticed that a handful of classical musicians had taken to Instagram to broaden their own reach, and decided to do the same. I started posting a few things, and was stunned by the reaction that I got. Suddenly you have people from around the world listening to you and telling you it brightens their day to watch you playing the violin, she enthuses. It opened this door to a completely new world. Nigerian-US baritone and lifelong hip-hop fanBabatunde Akinboboyeenjoyed a similarly swift and surprising rise to social media fame when he posted a video of himself singing Rossini's renowned aria Largo al factotum over the top of Kendrick Lamar's track Humble. I was in my car and I realised that the two pieces worked together musically, so I started singing on top of the beat, he tells BBC Culture. He documented the moment on his phone and posted the video on his personal Facebook account, guessing that his friends would enjoy it more than his opera peers. But I went to sleep, woke up the next morning, and it had expanded to my opera network, and far beyond that, he laughs, explaining that within two days, his self-dubbed brand of hip-hopera had caught the attention of The Ellen Show, America's Got Talent and Time magazine. Both Abrami and Akinboboye came to classical music in their teens, late by conventional standards, and cultivated their passion for the genre independently. This remains a driving factor in their desire to reach new audiences, which they've achieved on an impressive scale, largely just by being themselves. I ended up becoming an opera influencer by sharing the parts of me I felt comfortable sharing, which is a lot, says Akinboboye, whose playful hip-hopera and opera videos and posts – taking viewers behind the scenes of a world still shrouded in mystery  – have garnered him some 688,000 TikTok followers. It's a lot about how I relate to opera; my musical background was from hip-hop, but I still found a relationship with opera and that resonated with people, he explains. Almost every day I get a different message saying, 'I went to my first opera today'. I think it's because they're seeing someone they feel comfortable or familiar with. 'Complex and profound' Abrami, a similarly enthusiastic content creator, agrees: I think putting the face of somebody not so far away from them to the genre is a big thing. That's what I'm trying to do, to reach different types of people and create bridges, to show them that this music can really move you. It's complex and profound and yes, it might take a bit of time to understand but once you do, it's amazing.  British concert pianistHarriet Stubbsis another avid proponent of classical music for modern audiences who has been finding her own ways of drawing in new listeners. During lockdown, the musician, who usually splits her time between London and New York, performed multiple20-minute concertsfrom her ground-floor flat in West Kensington, opening the windows and using an amplifier to reach listeners outside. I gave 250 concerts, Stubbs, who was awarded a British Empire Medal by the Queen for this mood-boosting act of service, tells BBC Culture. I did a range of repertoire from my upcoming album, and also things like All By Myself, which I chose ironically for that audience. And the thing is, people who thought they didn't care for classical music came back every day because of the power of that music. The fusion of classical music with other genres is a major facet of Stubbs's practice and, indeed, that of many others among the new generation of classical artists (see also the React to the K YouTube channel, where classical artists frequently reimagine K-pop songs with ingenious results, or Kris Bowers' brilliant orchestral arrangements of modern pop songs for the much-buzzed-about Bridgerton soundtrack). Stubbs's innovative first album, Heaven & Hell: The Doors of Perception (2018), was inspired by William Blake and features musical icon Marianne Faithfull. I always wanted to tie rock'n'roll and classical music together and put them in the same space, supported by literature and philosophy and other disciplines, she explains, adding that her next album, which she's making with pianist and former Bowie collaborator Mike Garson, will be a Bowie meets Rachmaninoff affair. Interestingly, the current swell of enthusiasm for classical music has branched out to become as much of an aesthetic movement as it is a musical one. Digital microtrends Dark Academia and Light Academia – dedicated as they are to the romanticisation of a passion for art and knowledge through imagery – both make rousing use of classical music in order to create the desired ambience. Ascendant Polish countertenor Jakub Józef Orliński, meanwhile, uses atmosphericvisualsas a powerful means of contemporising the baroque experience. Depressed by the lack of funding for music video production in the classical realm, he drummed up private sponsorship to make a 21-minute movie to accompany his 2021 rendition of Vivaldi's Stabat Mater. The resulting film conjures a compelling and suitably brutal scenario for the haunting 18th-century hymn, whichThe New York Times describes asresembling a Polish remake of The Sopranos. I'm really interested in storytelling. I always build an entire concept for my albums – the narrative, the photography, the videos, Orliński tells BBC Culture. I think now there is this whole new generation of people who really want to add to what classical music can be, to go beyond the singing and be challenged. You just have to know that the end product will be good, and that what you're doing will serve the story, he adds. This is certainly something Orliński has achieved in his own career: an accomplished sportsman and breakdancer, hewowed criticswith his 2022 Royal Opera House debut, which found him pole-dancing in a spangled dress as Didymus in Katie Mitchell's production of Handel's Theodora. Other recent projects have included recording baroque tracks for forthcoming video games which, he says, was an incredible experience and is something he's being asked to do more and more frequently, as the Metaverse beckons. Sometimes you need classical music to touch the strings of somebody's soul – a pop song won't work. Classical music's ongoing and often powerful intersection with pop culture is being foregrounded as part of the burgeoning interest in the genre, both inside and outside its famously guarded gates. The all-teen members of the UK'sNational Youth Orchestrahave just completed a mini tour that included a performance of Richard Strauss's Also Sprach Zarathustra, replete with its opening symphonic sunrise eternalised by Stanley Kubrick in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Last August saw the BBC Proms launch its first gaming-themed programme whereby the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra took on some of the best-loved songs in video game history. While the recent autumn/winter collection from Acne Studios' younger sub-label Face offered up one of the most direct sartorial tributes to classical music to date, presenting crew-neck sweaters, T-shirts and tote bags embellished with the faces of Handel, Mozart and Bach in celebration of the idea that a passion for classical music is the most left-field move imaginable for a modern-day teenager. Orliński agrees that classical music has achieved an almost hipstery status of late. It's cool to go to the opera, to know something, and that's because there are a lot of young artists delivering music on the highest level, while making it very entertaining, he enthuses. There is, he observes, a revived interest in classical music personalities such as Maria Callas and Pavarotti, as well as people like Yuja Wang who are selling out concert halls, all of which he feels bodes well for the art form. We have a long way to go to grow as much as other genres of music, but we're moving forward. Akinboboye, too, is tentatively hopeful. I think opera is definitely being a lot more bold, and I hope that it continues because I think we can catch up, he concludes. [Classical music needs to] be brave, to do the scary thing.

    "section": "arts",
    "content": "A Dutch town hall has admitted that it most likely accidentally disposed of 46 artworks, including an Andy Warhol print of the former Dutch queen, during renovation works last year. Maashorst municipality said the works, including a 1980s silkscreen print of Queen Beatrix worth about €15,000 (£12,800), disappeared during work on a town hall last year. An investigation said the artworks were stored in a basement during renovations and a lack of guidelines for storing the artworks could have been among the reasons why they ended up being thrown away. Mayor Hans van der Pas told public broadcaster Omroep Brabant: That's not how you treat valuables. But it happened. We regret that. A statement by the municipality on Thursday said the artworks were put into storage during work on a town hall in Uden - which is being incorporated into the neighbouring municipality of Landerd to form the Maashorst municipality. It's most likely that the artworks were accidentally taken away with the trash, they said. A report by investigators found that some of the artworks were stored in wheelie bins in the basement and were not handled with care, according to local newspaper Algemeen Dagblad. The report concluded: Ownership was not properly established, no policies and procedures were established regarding the renovation and insufficient action was taken when the artworks turned out to be missing. It went on to say that a lack of guidelines for registration, storage, conservation and security of the artworks, were also contributing factors. Local media reports that the 46 artworks altogether were worth around €22,000 (£18,800) and the Maashorst municipality said it was unlikely they will ever be found. Queen Beatrix reigned as queen of the Netherlands from 1980 until she abdicated in 2013, when she was succeeded by her son King Willem-Alexander. The Queen Beatrix print was part of Warhol's series Reigning Queens, which comprised of 16 colourful prints of four monarchs, including the late Queen Elizabeth II, Margrethe II of Denmark - who abdicated in 2023 - and Queen Ntombi Twala of Eswatini, previously known as Swaziland. Warhol, considered one of the greatest artists of the 20th Century, created the prints in 1985 - two years before his death. In November last year, Warhol prints of Queen Beatrix and Ntombi Twala were stolen - and abandoned - duringa heist on a Dutch art gallery. Local police at the time said thieves took four silkscreen prints from the MPV Gallery in the North Brabant province and fled by car. But the portraits of Queen Beatrix and Queen Ntombi were later abandoned because they did not fit in the vehicle, NOS reported at the time.",

    "section": "arts",
    "content": "A much loved pet that inspired the composer Edward Elgar has been honoured in a stone sculpture. Dan the bulldog is the hero of Elgar's 11th Enigma Variation, but a wooden statue in Hereford installed in 2002 was looking a bit worse for wear. With funding from Hereford Guild of Mayor's Guides, a new sculpture of Dan has been carved in local sandstone and will soon be back on the banks of the River Wye. It's amazing. For so long, when we've taken our walks along the river bank we've been a bit sorry to show people poor old Dan in his shabby state, said Angela Eaton from the guild. He was thrown into the river at one point and travelled downstream to Mordiford, where he was spotted by a local resident, Ms Eaton said. He installed him in his own garden and tried to hold Herefordshire Council to ransom for not looking after him properly. The original Dan was a much-loved pet of the former organist at Hereford Cathedral, George Robertson Sinclair. In 1898, he was walking along the River Wye with his friend Edward Elgar when Dan fell into the water. All 14 parts of Elgar's orchestral work are inspired by one of his friends. He dedicated the 11th to Dan and recreated the sounds of him falling down the bank, paddling upstream and celebrating climbing out with a bark. The new sculpture has been carved by Saul Sheldon at Hereford Cathedral's Stonemason's Yard, a few metres away from where the real Dan lived. He's climbing out of the reeds, out of the river, said Mr Sheldon. If he was just sat there, gazing up at the clouds it would have been a bit easier I suppose but it's nice to do something a bit different. The old wooden one, he's been on his travels down the Wye. Hopefully this one will be much harder to tip over, that's for sure. The new stone Dan has been funded by the Hereford Guild of Mayor's Guides, the Elmley Foundation, Hereford City Council and the Herefordshire Community Foundation. He will be on permanent display on the Bishop's Meadow, opposite Hereford Cathedral. The sculpture will be unveiled on 26 July to mark the opening of the Three Choirs Festival in Hereford. The original wooden carving of Dan will be put on display at Hereford Museum.",

    "title": "Grande dame hangs up her ballet shoes aged 89",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8k78nvj83o",
    "section": "arts",
    "content": "Sheena Gough is 89 years old but she can easily lift her leg on to a ballet barre to demonstrate elegant dance moves to her class. The ballet teacher, who trained in London and Paris, has pupils who travel hundreds of miles every week for her 90-minute lessons in Edinburgh. But now the grande dame has decided to hang up her ballet shoes after a 72 year career. BBC Scotland News joined her last class in the Stockbridge area of the city, where her students said it was the end of an era. Sheena enrolled at the Scottish School of Ballet in Grosvenor Crescent in Edinburgh when she was 14 years old. By the age of 17, her talent had caught the eye of English ballet dancer and choreographer Anton Dolin - who begged her parents to let her be taught by Bolshoi-trained Olga Preobrajenska in Paris. Fortunately my parents agreed, Sheena said. I was really rather nervous, my parents took me over in the car and dropped me off at someone's flat in Paris and left me to get on with it. It wasn't even a school, she was just somebody that famous dancers from all over the world would go to to attend her classes, so it was a little bit daunting. Margot Fonteyn - the Royal Ballet prima ballerina -  was among Sheena's fellow pupils in the classes, which were conducted in French. She was sweet, I remember her having difficulty with one of the steps. It was all quite an adventure, Sheena said. But it was when she moved to London that she badly injured her ankle while doing pointe work - where dancers perform on the tips of their toes - and her parents told her to travel back to Edinburgh while it healed. There she helped with the teaching at her former ballet school during her recovery. And lo and behold I discovered I was far happier teaching than performing - and I've never looked back. I've been teaching ever since, she said. Ian Johnston, 60, regularly makes a 200-mile round trip from Carlisle to join Sheena's lessons. He first joined her class when he lived in Edinburgh in 1991. Now he brings his son, Sandy. I travel this distance every week because Sheena is one of a kind, her classes are inspirational and her teaching style is very exciting, he said. Ian contacted the BBC throughYour Voice, Your BBC Newsto suggest we tell Sheena's story. There is nobody else who teaches quite like her, Ian added. Her classes are notoriously tough and rewarding. It's going to be quite a shock not to have her anymore but I will hear her corrections in my head and her saying, 'Where's your face? Where's the join? Where's the excitement?' every time I do other classes in the future. Ian's son, Sandy, added: I can't tell you how much I will miss the classes, they are the best I have ever been to and unlike anything else. She doesn't let us away with anything, she notices everything, and she knows what you can aim for. I'm very sad she's retiring because you don't find many classes like these anymore. Sheena said she decided to retire after worrying she might not be able to remain at her peak. But she is not planning to have a rest. There is the garden and my house to tidy up, she said. I think I ought to make it easier for anybody who has to sort it out after I go. Another pupil, data scientist Ryan Mcmanus, said it was the end of an era. The 34-year-old, who travels more than 100 miles every week for the class, said: It's the highlight of my every week to come along and have a great time learning how to do things and getting corrections. I have been to other classes and what I like about Sheena is she is very insistent on the fundamentals: on correct placement, correct posture, on correct technique. I've seen a vast improvement in me and it's entirely down to her correctness, which I really appreciate coming from a scientific background myself. I had tears in my eyes when the class ended, I'm so sad and I sincerely doubt we will be able to find anyone like her again. Tracy Hawkes, a ballet dancer who owns the dance studio in St Stephen Street where Sheen's classes are held, said the teacher had left a wonderful legacy. She's certainly one of the grande dames in Scotland, she said. To have someone who has been through decades of change in style and methods of teaching but has continued to have been such a font of all knowledge and experience, to have someone who is nearly 90 still doing that is just amazing. I've been so proud to have her here at the studio and it's a very sad day now she's retiring. Some of Sheena's pupils have gone on to the Royal Ballet, International Ballet and the British Ballet. One of my former pupils is about to move to the Scottish Ballet and when he heard I was retiring he was on the phone saying he wants private lessons, I'll get you tickets to come see me dance if you just give me some private lessons, Sheena said. So, it's meant to be the end - but we'll see.",

    "content": "Dorset's joint Towns of Culture for 2025 are set to begin 12 months of events with a launch party later. Weymouth and Portlandreceived a combined £60,000 from Dorset Council in funding as part of the new County of Culture scheme. Every year, the initiative, run by the Arts Development Company, sees a different town, village or hamlet in Dorset named as the host, with last year's winner being Bridport. The locally based not-for-profit arts organisation, B-Side, is working with both town councils to organise events for the next 12 months. This evening St Nics Gallery in Weymouth will host what organisers called an unforgettable evening of music, art and dance. Activities from ballet and brass bands to natural history walks, film clubs, DJ nights festivals and more are expected over the next year. Starting this weekend, there will be street performances in Weymouth Town Centre and a brass brand playing at the Portland High Angle Battery. Reveal is the name of this year's scheme, because the board said it wanted to uncover creativity and change the way that people conceive of towns that sit in rural or coastal settings. Director Rocca Holly-Nambi said: Our communities have so much to offer creatively, and our places are rich with culture. We see this year as a springboard for working together, celebrating who we are, and putting in place solid foundations for a thriving cultural sector for years to come.

    "section": "arts",
    "content": "Esoteric and pioneering, the paintings of a lesser-known Pre-Raphaelite, Evelyn De Morgan, explored the trauma and meaning of war – and prefigured current fantasy art. On a rocky beach that glows red with lava, smoke-breathing dragons surround wretched-looking prisoners beseeching an angel to deliver them from suffering. The oil painting Death of the Dragon by Evelyn De Morgan looks at first like a scene from the New Testament's apocalyptic Book of Revelation. But, painted between 1914 and 1918, it's also something more personal and critical: an allegory for the misery and bondage of World War One, and the confrontation between good and evil. The spectacular painting, measuring more than a metre high, is one of the highlights of a new exhibition,Evelyn De Morgan: The Modern Painter in Victorian London, at London's Guildhall Art Gallery, home to the City of London Corporation's art collection. On display are rarely seen works from theDe Morgan Foundation, as well as twonewly-restored paintingsand two recreations, completed just last year, of works lost in an art warehouse fire in 1991. The show coincides with the reopening of the De Morgan Museum in Barnsley, Yorkshire, following an extensive roof renovation, and responds to arising interestin this lesser-known artist. She has tended to be eclipsed by her husband William – a ceramicist and writer, who had worked early in his career with the textile designerWilliam Morris– and the famous men in their circle: her uncle and art teacher, John Roddam Spencer Stanhope, for example, and the painters William Holman Hunt andDante Gabriel Rossetti. Much of what we know about De Morgan today comes from her sister Wilhelmina, who set up the De Morgan Foundation, but even she saw fit to publish the couple's posthumous biography under the title William De Morgan and his Wife. Yet, Evelyn De Morgan more than deserves the art world's belated acclaim. A Slade graduate, who was working at the tail end of the Pre-Raphaelite movement, she took the arguably twee or overly sentimental genre into new territory, creating tableaux that were unusually visionary and energetic. The women she portrayed were less passive than thosedepicted by her contemporaries, and featured as symbols of agency rather than objects of the male gaze. Instead of a drowned body floating down the river, as in Sir John Everett Millais'Ophelia, or figures whose main currency wastheir looks, we meet a skilledsorceress creating magical potionsandflying superheroineswho can cast rain, thunder and lightning from their fingers. These goddess-like figures show the influence of the classical art that De Morgan had studied. Immaculately executed works such asBoreas and Oreithyia(1896) reveal her interest in mythology and her mastery of the human form, reminiscent of Michelangelo. In Death of the Dragon, in terms of composition, it's easy to see the influence of Sandro Botticelli'sThe Birth of Venus(1483–1485), which De Morgan had visited in Florence. If De Morgan's haloed angel echoes this idea of rebirth − reflecting the artist's belief in a spiritual afterlife − then the winged beasts are its counterpart, Death, always biting at the heels of the people and threatening to overcome them. Elsewhere in her work, Death takes alternative forms: adark angel bearing a scythe,sea monstersor – more obliquely –a sand timer. It's a symbolism that speaks to life's transience, and acquires additional poignancy in her later work, conveying the collective trauma of living through a World War that claimed close to a million British lives. During the First World War they [the De Morgans] were in London, so they would have been directly affected, Jean McMeakin, Chair of the Board of Trustees of the De Morgan Foundation, tells the BBC. Death was real for them in a way that perhaps we've largely forgotten these days, she points out. Members of William's family died from tuberculosis, and his own health was often quite poor. Death was, in a way, always present in the background. More like this: •Why this iconic 1839 painting is not what it seems •The surprising story of Van Gogh's guardian angel •Nine striking, rare photos of 19th-Century America De Morgan was a pacifist and her art became a form of activism. InOur Lady of Peace(1907), a response to the Boer Wars, a knight pleads for protection and peace, while inThe Poor Man who Saved the City(1901), wisdom and diplomacy are advocated as alternatives to military intervention. Later, inThe Red Cross(1914-16), angels carry the crucified Christ over a withered landscape pierced by Belgian war graves – a suggestion, perhaps, that the Christian faith is at odds with the brutality of war, but offers us hope of redemption. You must never praise war, De Morgan declared in The Result of an Experiment (1909), a book ofautomatic writingco-authored with her husband. The Devil invented it, and you can have no conception of its horrors. The idea of the forces of good and evil acting upon ordinary people was pervasive at this time. Spiritualism was quite popular, asserts McMeakin, citing the author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle – the creator of Sherlock Holmes – as one of its most famous adherents. Other-worldly beliefs, she says, were probably the result of the turmoil, the massive changes happening in society leading up to the turn of the century, plus a period of many wars, which would have had an impact on their view of the world. Doubtless, De Morgan was also influenced by her mother-in-law, Sophia, a well-known spiritualist and medium. With so many lives lost, it was no doubt tempting to believe that you could reconnect with the departed. For De Morgan, materialism was in opposition to spirituality, and many of her works conflate the pursuit of wealth with death. Crowns, as worn by the winged serpents in Death of the Dragon, are a repeated motif denoting greed and miserliness. InEarthbound(1897), an avaricious king in a gold cloak patterned with coins is about to be overwhelmed by the angel of death, while inThe Barred Gate(c.1910-1914), a similar figure is denied entry to Heaven. With the future so uncertain, De Morgan places the importance of spiritual fulfilment and happiness at the centre of much of her work. InBlindness and Cupidity Chasing Joy from the City(1897), for example, Cupidity is personified as a crowned figure clutching treasures who is driving away Joy in the form of an angel. Here, as in Death of the Dragon, the central characters are chained, suggesting trapped souls. InThe Prisoner(1907-1908), the barred window and a woman's chained wrists make captivity a metaphor for gender inequality, hinting at the De Morgans' support foruniversal suffrage(Evelyn was a signatory of at least two important petitions, while her husband was vice-president of the Men's League for Women's Suffrage). The theme recurs inLuna(1885), where the rope-bound body of a moon goddess, a mythological figure of feminine power, functions as a metaphor for a woman's struggle to influence her own destiny. Christened Mary, Evelyn later adopted her then-gender-neutral middle name, as women's art was not taken seriously. She wanted to be considered on the same level as her male peers, says McMeakin. We can assume a huge degree of self-possession and determination in her desire to become a professional artist, she adds, making the point that even De Morgan's mother opposed her career choice. Technically, De Morgan was also a pioneer. She experimented with burnishing and rubbing gold pigment into her works to add depth and interest, and explored new painting techniques invented by her husband, made by grinding colours with glycerine and spirit. Stylistically, she was also ahead of her time. The unconventional use of pinks and purples, and the bold rings of rainbow-coloured light, prefigure thepsychedelic painting stylesof the 1970s, while her terrifying monsters would not look out of place incontemporary fantasy art. While art history has tended to paint women as virgin mothers, objects of beauty or temptresses, De Morgan's specifically female perspective recasts them as figures of hope that augur an alternative, brighter future. InLux in Tenebris(light in darkness) (1895), for example, the female figure holds an olive branch in her right hand, offering a pathway to peace. In Death of the Dragon, the angel is surrounded by a magnificent rainbow: a symbol (along with the sky) of joy that denotes spiritual fulfilment and freedom, as well as the promise of an afterlife. It's a mistake to think of works such as Death of the Dragon as completely bleak, argues McMeakin, noting that often with [her] apocalyptic scenes, there is a glimmer of hope, or a part of the painting that is calm. In many ways, Death of the Dragon is optimistic, expressing a sense that the war – the metaphorical dragon – is nearing its end, and that good can overcome evil. In this existential battle, De Morgan saw a place for her work. When she was aged  just 17, she chastised herself for not painting enough. Art is eternal, but life is short, she wrote in her diary. I will make up for it now, I have not a moment to lose.

    "title": "'We'll do Paddington proud' - Tom Fletcher reveals details of musical",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c793l125gwvo",
    "section": "arts",
    "content": "McFly star Tom Fletcher has said he felt overwhelming excitement working on the new Paddington stage musical, which producers have confirmed will open in November. The singer-songwriter said he hoped the music and lyrics he has written for the show would do Paddington proud, adding that the musical numbers are my favourite songs I've ever written. The show will open at the Savoy Theatre in the West End on 1 November, and follow Paddington as he arrives from Peru seeking a new home in London. The musical, which has been in development for five years, is based on Michael Bond's original novels and follows the hugely successful recent film series. Speaking about the show for the first time, Fletcher told BBC News he felt so honoured and lucky to be working on the project, which he said would reflect all of the fun, warmth and heart that the books and movies have captured so brilliantly. There is something so magical about seeing Paddington step out on to the stage, and seeing him... I was about to say in the flesh, but I guess in the fur is more accurate, he joked. Fletcher is best-known as the founding member of pop band McFly, whose hits include All About You, Obviously and Star Girl, and is also a successful children's author. He was first approached about Paddington around the time of the first Covid lockdown in early 2020, and workshopped the project with scriptwriter Jessica Swale, director Luke Sheppard and the producers before the showwas formally announced in 2023. With the musical now almost ready to launch, Swale told BBC News it would feature lots of juicy new material. We're bringing a lot of new flavours to the table, but of course we're all in love with the original material, so we've been faithful to our cast of characters, she said. Of course the Browns are part of it, and familiar faces like Mr Gruber and Mr Curry, but there are a lot of new people as well. We've been very inspired by the books and the films but we like to think we're covering new territory. Bond's first book in the series, A Bear Called Paddington, was published in 1958. The author went on to write 29 Paddington books in total, the final one being Paddington at St Paul's, which was published posthumously in 2018. The stories have sold more than 35 million copies worldwide. Fletcher said he relished the opportunity to find what the musical language of Paddington was. Having something that everybody knows but no-one's heard what it sounds like yet is a really exciting thing to be able to work on, he explained. He recalled that, when producer Eliza Lumley first called him about the project, he not only immediately replied with a very fast 'yes please', but began writing music for the show right away. While I was still on the phone to her, I had the idea for a song, so I went and wrote my first song for it that night, instantly after getting off the phone, and that song is still in the musical now. He reflected: My instant reaction wasn't to be intimidated, it was to be excited and just so inspired by these stories and films that I already knew, I just jumped straight at my piano and started writing. The three film adaptations of Paddington, featuring the voice of Ben Whishaw, have been a huge success at the box office since the first was released in 2014. In recent years, London has seen pop group Abba represented by virtual avatars on stage, while some animated film characters have been depicted using more traditional puppeteering methods, such as snowman Olaf in the stage adaptation of Frozen. It has not yet been revealed what approach producers will take to representing Paddington in the theatre. I don't know what you're talking about, he's a bear! joked Swale. He's travelling from Peru to be a special part of our show! She continued: I can't give away our secrets. One of the things I'm most excited about for this show is the character of Paddington.  Swale credits producers Lumley and Sonia Friedman for really experimenting with every possible way that we could tell the bear's story in the best way, and the magic that they've found in how they do it”, adding: “Every single time I see Paddington for the first time, it makes me cry. I think he's completely magic, and to me he's very real. But I don't think audiences will be disappointed. It's a wonderful, theatrical version of how to tell this story. As for the character himself, Swale noted the musical also reveals the spirit and the politics of Paddington. For example, Paddington is a refugee, so we want to honour the fact that he is somebody who migrates to the UK and doesn't have a home, and make sure we are conscious of the experience of who he represents. Between now and the show's opening in November, Fletcher said the team would be fine-tuning for as long as we can, and making sure that we get it absolutely right. He added: I really hope that I've done everyone who loves Paddington justice... This is so different to anything I've ever done before. I feel like this show is so ready to be out in the world, it's the most special thing I've ever been a part of in my whole life. The 39-year-old will be on tour with McFly and Busted when the musical opens in November, so I'll be going from touring with the band and then rushing back to London to fit it all in, he explained. It's a slightly hectic schedule, but we'll make it work somehow. I might get confused and start singing Paddington songs on stage with McFly. Most important, of course, is the question of whether or not Paddington's favourite food will feature in the stage adaptation. You can rest easy, laughed Swale. Marmalade features not only in the book and the lyrics, but physically on stage in a spectacular way.",

    "title": "Proms go dark: The Traitors and all-night concerts planned for 2025",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m9gllw4dzo",
    "section": "arts",
    "content": "Organisers of the BBC Proms are encouraging fans to stay up all night, with a magical and intimate after-hours concert at the Royal Albert Hall. Plans for the Dark Till Dawn Prom were unveiled in the programme announcing the summer festival, which will also feature one-handed pianist Nicholas McCarthy, rock star St Vincent and a celebration of film composer Bernard Herrmann. The ever-popular CBeebies Prom will return, and Claudia Winkleman will host a concert exploring the tense and haunting soundtrack to the hit TV show The Traitors. Highlights of the classical repertoire include Shoshtakovich's opera Lady Macbeth, and Korean sensation Yunchan Lim playing Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto No 4. On 5 September, Sir Simon Rattle will conduct Chineke! - Europe's first minority Black and ethnically diverse orchestra - for the first time. Their concert will include a performance of the final work by Pulitzer-winning US composer George Walker, which was written as a response to the2015 Charleston church shooting. Other stars gracing the 2025 season include soprano of the moment Aigul Akhmetshina, making her Proms debut, violinist Randall Goosby, sitar virtuoso Anoushka Shankar, Pakistani-American singer Arroj Aftab, and Grammy award-winner Angelique Kidjo. There will be 86 concerts in all, with a number taking place in Gateshead, Bristol, Bradford, Belfast and Sunderland. Tickets go on sale at 9am on 17 May. On-the-day Promming tickets are £8 including booking fees, and seated tickets start from £10 plus booking fees. The all-nighter, on 8 August, is being planned by organist Anna Lapwood, who said the idea had been several years in the making. I spend a lot of time at the Albert Hall in the middle of the night, practising, and I find it fascinating that the building is still just running overnight, she says. There are always people there - cleaners and security guards - a bit like A Night At The Museum. So we talked about how fun it would be to be able to invite people into that space, both physically, but also the abstract space of being in an iconic building in the middle of the night. Her programme will include YouTube pianist Hayato Sumino, Russian cellist Anastasia Kobekina and Norwegian ensemble Barroksolistene, whose Alehouse sessions aim to recreate the atmosphere of a 17th Century English tavern. Lapwood says the artists are all connected by an enthusiasm for messing around with music, citing Sumino's viral video of the seven degrees of Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star. There are various moments where we're hoping to do some collaborations, she reveals. But the logistics of this are all very, very complicated, not least trying to figure out everyone's sleep schedules! This summer's season is the first since the departure of Proms director David Pickard. He has been replaced by Hannah Donat who, as director of artistic planning, had shaped the festival alongside the controller of BBC Radio 3, Sam Jackson. I think of the Proms as the classical music equivalent of Wimbledon, she says. Everyone likes to go to Wimbledon, even if they don't watch tennis for the rest of the year; and everyone likes to go to a Prom, even if they're not going to concerts for the rest of the season. It gives the concerts a warmth and an informal atmosphere. People don't worry too much about knowing the repertoire inside out - there's just something spectacular about the Albert Hall and seeing the orchestra onstage.  Among the concerts to watch out for are: 19 July: The Great American Songbook and Beyond with Samara Joy. Fresh from winning best jazz album at this year's Grammys, US singer Samara Joy teams up with the BBC Concert Orchestra for a night of standards by Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Billie Holliday. 20 July: Ravel's Piano Concerto for the Left Hand. The world's only professional one-handed concert pianist, Nicholas McCarthy, makes his Proms debut, playing a concerto originally written for Paul Wittgenstein, after he lost his right arm during World War One. 26 July: The Traitors.I've asked for a cloak and an owl, says Claudia Winkelman, ahead of this one-off concert, featuring classical pieces with betrayal at their heart alongside the gothic re-workings of pop songs heard in the TV reality show. 2 August: Mahler's Resurrection Symphony. Canadian mezzo-soprano Emily D'Angelo, whose voice has been called a thing of wonder, makes her Proms debut with Norwegian soprano Mari Eriksmoen and the Hallé orchestra. 8 August: 100 Years of the Shipping Forecast. The subtle magic of the Shipping Forecast is celebrated in a special concert, in Belfast's Ulster Hall, featuring Radio 4's continuity announcers and a new work by poet laureate Simon Armitage. 9 August: The Planets and Star Wars.The National Youth Orchestra play two of the world's most recognisable pieces of orchestral music, with an intergalactic theme. 10 August: Edward Gardner Conducts the LPO.Taking a journey through icy waters and cascading waterfalls, the London Philharmonic present a quartet of pieces, including Debussy's La Mer and Sibelius's Oceanides - with an aquatic theme. Electrifying mezzo-soprano Aigul Akhmetshina joins in, for her Proms debut. 14 August: Joe Hisaishi and Steve Reich.Legendary Studio Ghibli composer Joe Hisaishi makes his Proms debut conducting the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in two large-scale works exploring themes of destruction and loss - including his piece The End of the World, reflecting the anxiety and chaos after the 2001 terrorist attacks in New York. 23 August: Mäkelä conducts Mahler's Fifth. Finnish conductor Klaus Mäkelä isn't yet 30, but his electrifying performances have already made headlines around the world. He comes to the Proms with the Dutch Concertgebouw Orchestra, to play Mahler's leonine fifth symphony. 7 September: Angelique Kidjo - African Symphony. I want to show the world the richness and beauty of African culture, says the Beninese-French music icon Angelique Kidjo of her return to the Proms. Part of Bradford's City of Culture programme, her concert will highlight iconic tracks from legends including Miriam Makeba, Fela Kuti and Youssou N'Dour. The season concludes with the traditional Last Night on 13 September, conducted by Elim Chan. Soprano Louise Alder and trumpeter Alison Balsom will make star turns, alongside the traditional medley of sea shanties, Pomp and Circumstance and Auld Lang Syne. The concert will also include Donat's favourite Easter egg for her first year in charge. There's a piece of music that I'd wanted to get into the Proms for some time, she says, referring to Arthur Benjamin's Storm Cloud Contata. The music was originally written for Alfred Hitchcock's spy thriller The Man Who Knew Too Much in 1934; and re-arranged by Bernard Herrmann for Hitchcock's Hollywood remake in 1956. The final scene takes place in the Albert Hall, explains Donat, and while Jimmy Stewart's chasing this assassin around the building, Bernard Herrmann is conducting the orchestra on stage - and that's the piece we're including in the Last Night of the Proms. It's one of those little winks to the audience that I like to include during the season. For those who cannot attend, all of the concerts will be broadcast on BBC Radio 3 and BBC Sounds, and 25 of the nights will be televised.",

    "content": "A learning disabled artist, a former Iraqi refugee and one of the youngest ever nominees are among the artists shortlisted for this year's Turner Prize. Nnena Kalu, Mohammed Sami, Zadie Xa and Rene Matić - who at 27 is the second youngest artist to be nominated after Damien Hirst - are all in the running for the prestigious annual art prize, the Tate announced on Wednesday. An exhibition of their work will be held at the Cartwright Hall Art Gallery from September as part of Bradford's UK City of Culture celebrations. The winner, who will be awarded £25,000, will then be announced on 9 December at a ceremony in the West Yorkshire city. Alex Farquharson, director of Tate Britain and chair of the Turner Prize jury, said the shortlist reflects the breadth of artistic practice today, from painting and sculpture to photography and installation. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the artists, who are each guaranteed to receive £10,000, offer extraordinary world-views that are very personal. Take a closer look at all four shortlisted artists and their work: Glasgow-bornNnena Kalu(above), who has limited verbal communication, has been a resident artist with Action Space, which supports artists with learning disabilities, for more than 25 years. She creates large-scale swirling abstract drawings and sculpures made from colourful streams of repurposed fabrics and materials such as reels of VHS tape. The jury praised her unique command of material, colour and gesture and her highly attuned responses to architectural space. Photographer, writer and poetRene Matić, from Peterborough, is nominated for their solo exhibition, As Opposed To The Truth, at CCA Berlin, which touches on the rise of right-wing populism and identities. Matić captures fleeting moments of joy in daily life, and expressions of tenderness within a wider political context, according to Tate, using intimate photos of family and friends placed in an installation which also includes objects like the artist's collection of black baby dolls salvaged from second-hand shops. The work looks at themes including the constructed self through the lens of rudeness and rudeboy culture, a Jamaican subculture. The jury said they were struck by the artist's ability to express concerns around belonging and identity. Mohammed Samihails from Baghdad and his work draws on his life and experiences during the Iraq war and as a refugee in Sweden. The artist is recognised for solo exhibition After the Storm at Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, and the jury were impressed by his powerful representation of war and exile. His large-scale paintings explore memory and loss, layering patterns and colours to create haunting, dreamlike scenes. Zadie Xacomes from Vancouver, Canada, and her work is inspired by her Korean heritage and the importance of shamanic beliefs. Interweaving paintings, murals, traditional patchwork textiles and 650 brass bells that make harmonised sounds inspired by Korean shamanic ritual bells, Xa's art focuses on the sea as a spiritual realm to explore traditions and folklore, speaking to a multitude of cultures. The jury felt the vibrant installation was a sophisticated development of her work. Established in 1984, the prize is named after radical painter JMW Turner -who would have turned 250 on Wednesday- and is awarded each year to a British-based  artist for an outstanding exhibition or other presentation of their work. Shanaz Gulzar, creative director Bradford UK City of Culture 2025, said it was a huge honour and privilege to bring the prize tothe city that gave the world David Hockney. Bradford has produced some amazing artists, literary artists, visual artists, contemporary artists, she told Radio 4. And to have these four artists in Bradford, I think really speaks to how we're delivering our year so far, and it speaks to our audiences. Last year's prize was won by Jasleen Kaur, who used a vintage Ford Escort, worship bells and Irn-Bru to celebrate the Scottish Sikh community. Other ther previous winners have included Sir Anish Kapoor (1991), Damien Hirst (1995) and Sir Steve McQueen (1999).",

    "content": "The UK's Eurovision hopefuls, Remember Monday, have covered a song from Will Ferrell's cult movie about the contest, as the finals draw closer. The trio travelled to Iceland earlier this month to filmtheir version of Húsavík (My Hometown), originally sung by Rachel McAdams' character Sigrit in the Netflix spoof, The Story Of Fire Saga. It's released just three weeks before the band perform their own song, What The Hell Just Happened, at this year's Eurovision Song Contest in Basel, Switzerland. Bookmakers predict that the UK will fall just outside the top 10 in the contest, with Sweden and Austria among the favourites to win. However, Remember Monday told BBC News that they're hungry to get a good result. We feel like there's a little bit of a stigma around Eurovision, and we'd really love to be a part of changing it, said singer Holly-Anne Hull. The group, completed by Charlotte Steele and Lauren Byrne, started singing together in school, and went on to have starring roles in West End shows like Les Misérables, Phantom Of The Opera and Six: The Musical.  As long-standing Eurovision fans, they've thrown themselves into a whirlwind European press tour, performing in about a dozen countries, and even singing on a Swiss mountaintop. For their journey to Húsavík, Steele even confronted her fear of flying by travelling in both a propellor plane and a helicopter. The trip fulfilled a long-time dream of ours, the band said. In the music video, they get to visit the charming Elf Houses that form part of the country's magical folklore, and sing with a choir of Icelandic schoolgirls who previously performed at the 2001 Oscars, when Húsavík (My Hometown) was nominated for best original song. We're very honoured that they welcomed us into their beautiful town and let us sing that song, said the band, and we're grateful that it's on film so we can relive those memories forever. We've never seen anywhere as beautiful with our own eyes! Ahead of Eurovision, the BBC has announced a one-off special, featuring Graham Norton in conversation with Remember Monday. The programme will be broadcast on Friday 9 May on BBC One, giving a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the band's preparations for Basel. Separately, BBC Radio 2 has revealed that Sara Cox is joining the station's presenting line-up for this year's contest. The broadcaster will commentate on the semi-finals alongside Richie Anderson. Scott Mills and Rylan will host the grand final on 17 May. Rehearsals for the contest start today (25 April) at the Jakobshalle arena. In the initial stages, stand-ins perform the 37 entries, allowing participants to review staging, choreography and lighting cues before contestants arrive in Switzerland at the start of May. Last year's contest was won by Swiss singer Nemo for their song The Code - a semi-operatic pop song that charted their journey to realising they were non-binary. This year's favourite is Swedish entrant KAJ, whose song Bara Bada Bastu is an ode to the benefits of the sauna. If they emerge victorious, Sweden will record its eighth win - breaking a tie with Ireland as Eurovision's most-successful nation.",

    "section": "culture",
    "content": "A Dutch town hall has admitted that it most likely accidentally disposed of 46 artworks, including an Andy Warhol print of the former Dutch queen, during renovation works last year. Maashorst municipality said the works, including a 1980s silkscreen print of Queen Beatrix worth about €15,000 (£12,800), disappeared during work on a town hall last year. An investigation said the artworks were stored in a basement during renovations and a lack of guidelines for storing the artworks could have been among the reasons why they ended up being thrown away. Mayor Hans van der Pas told public broadcaster Omroep Brabant: That's not how you treat valuables. But it happened. We regret that. A statement by the municipality on Thursday said the artworks were put into storage during work on a town hall in Uden - which is being incorporated into the neighbouring municipality of Landerd to form the Maashorst municipality. It's most likely that the artworks were accidentally taken away with the trash, they said. A report by investigators found that some of the artworks were stored in wheelie bins in the basement and were not handled with care, according to local newspaper Algemeen Dagblad. The report concluded: Ownership was not properly established, no policies and procedures were established regarding the renovation and insufficient action was taken when the artworks turned out to be missing. It went on to say that a lack of guidelines for registration, storage, conservation and security of the artworks, were also contributing factors. Local media reports that the 46 artworks altogether were worth around €22,000 (£18,800) and the Maashorst municipality said it was unlikely they will ever be found. Queen Beatrix reigned as queen of the Netherlands from 1980 until she abdicated in 2013, when she was succeeded by her son King Willem-Alexander. The Queen Beatrix print was part of Warhol's series Reigning Queens, which comprised of 16 colourful prints of four monarchs, including the late Queen Elizabeth II, Margrethe II of Denmark - who abdicated in 2023 - and Queen Ntombi Twala of Eswatini, previously known as Swaziland. Warhol, considered one of the greatest artists of the 20th Century, created the prints in 1985 - two years before his death. In November last year, Warhol prints of Queen Beatrix and Ntombi Twala were stolen - and abandoned - duringa heist on a Dutch art gallery. Local police at the time said thieves took four silkscreen prints from the MPV Gallery in the North Brabant province and fled by car. But the portraits of Queen Beatrix and Queen Ntombi were later abandoned because they did not fit in the vehicle, NOS reported at the time.",

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250423-the-best-films-of-2025",
    "section": "culture",
    "content": "BBC film critics Caryn James and Nicholas Barber pick their cinema highlights of the year so far, from a brutal war epic to an ambitious period vampire drama. The sharpest American indie film of the year so far, Companion stars Jack Quaid and Sophie Thatcher as a devoted young couple who go to stay with some friends in a Russian tycoon's remote forest getaway. (Rupert Friend has a hilarious cameo as the mulleted oligarch.) As a drunken evening of confessions, suspicions and disagreements unfolds, it seems at first if the film might be a romantic comedy, or maybe a noirish thriller about a robbery gone wrong. In fact, Companion is a science-fiction comedy thriller – but beyond that, the less you know about the film in advance, the more enjoyable its many ingenious twists and turns will be. Suffice it to say that the big-screen debut of writer-director Drew Hancock is a sparklingly entertaining satire on modern technology and the never-more-relevant topic of how entitled and misogynistic certain insecure young men can be. And it packs all of its ideas into 97 minutes. (NB) As stunning as Ryan Coogler'sBlack Pantherwas, he has outdone himself with Sinners. Michael B Jordan is slyly convincing as twins named Smoke and Stack, who return from Chicago to their home town in Mississippi, in the Jim Crow South in 1932, to open a juke joint. With huge ambition and imagination, Coogler swirls familiar genres and tropes into a wholly original film that blurs the real and the supernatural. Sinners is a period piece as well as a vampire film. It is a drama about racism, family, superstition and spirituality, and it comes with passionate sex and exhilarating blues music. Coogler directs with brio, at times creating a phantasmagoria in which robed African musicians appear next to rappers. The first hour is so full of texture it could stand alone as a period film, but the supernatural eventually intrudes, leading to a finale of action, blood and vengeance. Jordan is surrounded by a superb supporting cast, including Delroy Lindo, Wunmi Musaku and Hailee Steinfeld.  Sex, blues and vampires at the door? What more can anyone want from a film? (CJ) Miranda Yousef's riveting documentary tells the stranger-than-fiction story ofThomas Kinkade, one of the biggest-selling artists in history. Critics dismissed his work as nauseatingly sickly, but in the 1990s and 2000s, there were shops all around the US devoted to Kinkade's sentimental pictures of cosy country cottages. Art for Everybody asks fascinating questions about who gets to decide what counts as legitimate art, and whether some paintings can be more moral than others – questions that resonate today, in light of the continuing culture wars in the US . But Yousef's delicately balanced and sensitive film is just as fascinating on personal issues as it is on sociopolitical ones. A key part of Kinkade's marketing was his carefully constructed public image as a devoutly Christian, all-American family man, and yet the so-called Painter of Light had a dark side, too. Did the pressures of being a squeaky-clean Dr Jekyll push him into becoming a self-destructive Mr Hyde? (NB) Alex Garland, the writer and director ofCivil War, and Ray Mendoza, a veteran who was that film's military advisor, have created a harrowing, visceral, real-time drama that recreates an actual battle between Navy Seals and al-Qaeda jihadists. Garland's virtuoso technique and Mendoza's first-hand experience of war blend in a film of uncompromising focus, which plunges us into the intensity of combat without explanation or backstory. Yet the faces of Joseph Quinn, Will Poulter, Cosmo Jarvis and D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai are enough to capture the fear and determination of being under siege. Creating characters far from the bravado of typical Hollywood war films, the actors depict courage in battle as a terror-filled endurance test. The film immerses us in that feeling. It is loud and intense, relentless in its barrage of grenades and gunfire, and when the cries of pain from the injured men start, they never stop. Warfare is a dazzling technical achievement but much more. Focusing on the personal cost of combat and violence itself rather than the politics of the Iraq conflict, it reinvents the war film with bracing freshness and immediacy. (CJ) Barry Keoghan, Christopher Abbott and Colm Meaney star in this dark and bloody western-style thriller about a feud between sheep farmers in remote rural Ireland. Meaney and Abbott (who speak their dialogue in Irish) play a laconic father and son who lose their two prize rams, only to discover that they have been stolen by their neighbour's shiftless son (Keoghan). Accusations are made, simmering resentments reach boiling point, and violence ensues – but then Christopher Andrews, the film's debut writer-director, rewinds his story and replays it from a revelatory new perspective. Suddenly, a hard-boiled story of crime and retribution becomes an aching tragedy about desperate economic hardship, youthful stupidity, male pride, and the traumas passed down from taciturn fathers to taciturn sons. Bring Them Down is tough to watch but it's beautifully shot, cleverly plotted and stunningly powerful. (NB) Alain Guiraudie's (Stranger by the Lake) engaging film is full of surprises. It starts as a drama about Jeremie, a young man returning to his small village in the lush French countryside for a funeral, then becomes a quietly comic take on desire along with a thriller about covering up a murder. The film deftly carries the audience with it through all these turns. Jeremie is an opportunist but also an enigma. He may have had a passion for his former boss and mentor, the village baker, who died. The baker's widow definitely seems interested in Jeremie, who grew up as the best friend of her son, Vincent; he now angrily suspects Jeremie of wanting to sleep with his mother. Jeremie does not want that but he does find himself in a reluctant affair with the local priest. The joke is that so many people lust after the unremarkable Jeremie, and the suspense comes from the small-town eyes and local police wondering what happened when Vincent mysteriously disappears. Misericordia (Latin for mercy) was nominated for eight Cesar awards, the French equivalent of the Oscars, including film and director, but its human comedy lands easily with audiences everywhere. (CJ) Deep in the leafy French countryside, a scruffy teenage layabout Totone (Clément Faveau) has to look after his younger sister Claire (Luna Garret) after the sudden death of their father. His answer to their dire financial problems? Making award-winning luxury cheese. Louise Courvoisier's debut film is a heart-tugging coming-of-age drama, rooted in the soil of the Jura region where she grew up. She offers an earthy insider's view of how strenuous life can be for agricultural workers, and how wrenching it is when carefree youth turns to relentless, responsible adulthood. But she also fashions a warm, romantic, gorgeously scenic and ultimately hopeful tale of underdogs working together in the sunshine to improve their lives. Blessed are the cheesemakers, asMonty Pythononce put it. (NB) A giant, sloppy Great Dane tugs Naomi Watts around the streets of Manhattan, but by the end of this lovely film about affection and grief the physical comedy with the dog seems the least of it. Watts smoothly play Iris, a creative writing teacher whose best friend, Walter, a famous womanising author, kills himself. He leaves her his dog, Apollo, even though she lives in a one-room apartment in a pet-free building. Dealing with Apollo becomes a way for Iris to grapple with her feelings of love and loss for Walter, played by Bill Murray in flashback scenes filled with such wit and tenderness that they have a great impact in spite of his minimal screen time. Based on Sigrid Nunez's eloquent, acclaimed 2018 novel, the film was directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel, whose films include the underrated Montana Story (2021) with Haley Lu Richardson and Owen Teague. Avoiding mawkish clichés, they have created a gem of a film that is funny and touching whether you are a pet lover or not. Come for the rambunctious Great Dane, stay for the beautifully rendered emotions. (CJ) Aardman's two greatest heroes are back – and so is their sneakiest ever adversary, a diabolical penguin named Feathers McGraw. Directed by Nick Park and Merlin Crossingham, the Oscar-nominated Vengeance Most Fowl is chock-full of the qualities that make Wallace & Gromit's farcical adventures so cherished: the painstaking stop-motion claymation, the Heath Robinson-style gadgetry, the winking homages to classic cinema, the gleefully silly British humour, and the deep affection for the characters and their world. Above all, it a treat to see Feathers McGraw, more than 30 years after he was introduced in The Wrong Trousers. But there is more to the Bristol-based studio's new film than the nostalgic whimsy you would expect. When Wallace invents a robotic garden gnome that does all of Gromit's favourite gardening jobs (and that's even before it turns evil), the story takes a canalboat trip intoMission: Impossibleterritory by addressing fears about artificial intelligence. (NB) The immensely talented director Rungano Nyoni, whose I Am Not a Witch (2017) won a Bafta for outstanding British debut, makes artful, accessible films of great visual panache. Her latest is a clear-eyed drama about cultural and generational conflict. The heroine, Shula, is a cosmopolitan woman recently returned from the city to her village in Zambia. Nyoni conveys this dissonance at once, as Shula drives home from a costume party dressed in a glittery silver helmet and dark glasses (an homage to a Missy Elliott video) and finds her Uncle Fred dead on a dirt road. As the story takes us into the family's traditional funeral rituals, it slowly reveals that Shula and two cousins had been abused by Fred as children, a reality their mothers put aside as they mourn their brother. Nyoni's style is realistic even as she drops in surreal images. The narrative about secrecy and the trauma of sexual assault builds in power right to the end, when Shula recalls a children's television programme and the title of this stunning film finally makes sense.

    "title": "Yungblud on keeping fans safe, and his 'shirt off era'",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj3x2z6k3ljo",
    "section": "culture",
    "content": "The Netherlands, March 2025. Yungblud is leaving his hotel in Amsterdam when he's approached by a fan in floods of tears. You saved my life,she sobs. No, you saved your own life, he replies, quietly. Maybe the music was the soundtrack, but you saved your own life, OK? Leaning in for a hug, he adds, Don't be sad, be happy. I love ya. It's a remarkably touching moment, full of compassion and devoid of rock star ego. Two weeks later, after a video of the encounter goes viral, Yungblud is still moved by the memory. I didn't think people would see that, except me and her, he says, but it was such a moment for me. The interaction crystallised something he'd felt for a while. I always said that Bowie and My Chemical Romance saved my life, but ultimately you have to find yourself, he says. Like this morning, I put my headphones on and I listened to [The Verve's] Lucky Man, and it made me go, 'Oh, I'm ready to face the day'. But Richard Ashcroft didn't tell me I was ready to face the day. I said that to myself. That's what I was trying to tell that girl in Amsterdam.  Self-assurance is a lesson he learned the hard way. On the surface, Yungblud, aka 27-year-old Dominic Harrison, had it all. Two number one albums, an international fanbase,a Louis Theroux documentaryand enough clout to run his own festival. But if you looked more closely, there were chinks in the armour. Those number one albums both fell out of the Top 30 after one week, a sign of a strong core fanbase, with limited crossover appeal. And the first year of his Bludfest in Milton Keynes was criticised afterlong queues and a lack of watercaused fans to pass out and miss the concert. Harrison was keenly aware of it all. As he released his self-titled third album in 2022, he hit a low. Yungblud was number one in seven countries, and I wasn't happy because it wasn't the album I wanted to make, he says. It was a good album, but it wasn't exceptional. The problem, he says, was a record label who'd pushed him in a more commercial direction. But in polishing his sound, he lost the angry unpredictability that characterised his best work. It's funny, my-self titled album was actually the one where I was most lost, he observes. I felt like I compromised but, because of that, I was never taking no for an answer again. Nowhere is that clearer than on his comeback single,Hello Heaven, Hello. Over nine minutes and six seconds it achieves Caligulan levels of excess, full of scorching guitar solos, throat-shredding vocal runs, and even an orchestral coda. Do you still remember, or have you forgotten where you're from? Harrison asks himself, as he re-ignites his ambition. The song's purposefully unsuited to radio – unlike the follow-up single, Lovesick Lullaby. Released today, it's a free-associating rampage through a messy night out, that ends with epiphany in a drug dealer's apartment. Combining Liam Gallagher's sneer with Beach Boys' harmonies, it's uniquely Yungblud. But the singer reveals it was originally written for his last album.  We were actually discouraged from doing it, he says. My advisor at the time, a guy called Nick Groff [vice president of A&R at Interscope, responsible for signing Billie Eilish], was like, 'I don't get it'. Warming to the theme, he continues: The music industry is crap because it's all about money but, as an artist, I need to make sure that anything I put out is exciting and unlimited. It can't be like a 50% version of me. To achieve that, he shunned expensive recording studios and made his new album in a converted Tetley brewery in Leeds. Professional songwriters were banished, too, in favour of a close group of collaborators, including guitarist Adam Warrington, and Matt Schwartz, the Israeli-British producer who helmed his 2018 debut. When you make an album in LA or London, everything is great, even if it's mediocre, because people want a hit out of it, he argues. When you make an album with family, all they want is the truth. One of the most honest tracks on the record is Zombie, a lighters-aloft ballad (think Coldplay, sung by Bruce Springsteen) about feeling you're ugly, and learning to battle that. I always was insecure about my body, and that got highlighted as I got famous, says the singer, who last year revealed he'ddeveloped an eating disorderdue to body dysmorphia. But I realised, the biggest power you can give someone over you is in how you react. So I decided, I'm going to get sober, I'm going to get fit, and I discovered boxing. He ended up working with the South African boxer Chris Heerden - who was recently in the news afterRussia jailed his ballerina girlfriend, Ksenia Karelina. I met him before all that, says Harrison, but he's been extremely inspirational. Boxing's become like therapy for me. If someone says something bad about me, I go to the gym, hit the punch bag for an hour and talk it out. Fans have noticed the change… drooling over photos of his newly chiseled torso, and declaring 2025 his shirt-off era. Maybe the shirt-off era is a comeback to all the comments I've had, he laughs. I'm claiming a freedom and a sexiness and a liberation. He's clearly found a degree of serenity, without surrendering the restless energy that propelled him to fame. Part of that is down to control. In January,he created a new companythat brings together his core business of recorded music with touring operations, his fashion brand and his music festival, Bludfest. The event kicked off in Milton Keynes last summer but suffered teething troubles, when fans were stuck in long queues. I will fully take responsibility for that, says the star, who claims he was backstage screaming at police and promoters to get the lines moving. The problem was, there were six gates open when there should have been 12, he says, suggesting people underestimated his fans' dedication. When Chase and Status had played [there] a day before, there were 5,000 people when the doors opened, and another 30,000 trickled in during the day. With my fans, there were 20,000 kids at the gate at 10am. So we've learned a lot for this year. There'll be pallets of water outside. It'll be very different.  Dedication to his fans is what makes Yungblud Yungblud. He built the community directly from his phone and, whether intended or not, that connection has sustained his career - insulating him from the tyrannies of radio playlists and streaming placement. Maintaining a personal relationship becomes harder as his fanbase grows but, ever astute, he hired a fan to oversee his social accounts. She's called Jules Budd. She used to come to my gigs in Austin and she'd sell confetti to pay for gas money to the next city. She built an account called Yungblud Army, and she's amazing at letting me understand what are people feeling. If people are outside and security aren't treating them right, I know about it because she's in contact with them. So I brought her in to make the community safer as it gets bigger. With his new album, he wants to make that community even bigger. Harking back to the sounds of Queen and David Bowie, he says it'll reclaim the good chords (Asus4 and Em7, in case you're wondering). The shackles are off, he grins. We made an album to showcase our ambition and the way we want to play. Can you imagine seeing Yungblud in a stadium? 100% yes. Let's do it.",

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dg7zrvdj2o",
    "section": "culture",
    "content": "The team behind Netflix's new action thriller Havoc say it will put Wales on the map for filmmakers across the world. Starring Tom Hardy as a jaded detective, Havoc tells the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong. Although it is set in an unnamed US city, all of it - including car chases and shootouts - was filmed in Wales. Hardy and his co-star Forest Whitaker werespotted filming in south Wales in 2021, but the production experienced several delays because of the pandemic andthe writers strike in the US. Havoc, which also stars Luis Guzmán, Jessie Mei Li and Timothy Olyphant, began with the vision of its Welsh director Gareth Evans. I had this, like, one core image which was a corrupt cop in a crime scene where a drug deal's gone wrong and for whatever reason he was scooping cocaine into a coffee cup, said Evans, best known for gangster film The Raid and thriller series Gangs of London. And it all mushroomed out from there. Evans said it was incredible when Hardy came on board in the lead role and as a producer. One of the nicest things about Tom [is] I knew I was in my wheelhouse when it came to action film-making, but with Tom his skillset is deep dive explorations into morally complex characters and so we were able to fuse two styles together. Evans, who grew up in Hirwaun, Rhondda Cynon Taf, still lives in Wales. He said recreating the US in south Wales was challenging but he wanted to bring work to the area. I started going around, like, Swansea, Port Talbot, Cardiff and Newport, looking for any little bit of architecture that I could find that might pass as a little bit Americana, he said. And so we took a look and we thought if we can get 30% or 40% real in camera then the VFX (visual effects) can take care of the rest. Swansea's Brangwyn Hall became the outside of an American police precinct, Swansea University's Bay campus provided exterior street shots, and a fishing shack was built in the Merthyr Mawr countryside. Although Havoc was made in Wales, US production company XYZ Films joined forces with Wales-based Severn Screen to make it. Aram Tertzakian, one of XYZ Films' founders, has worked with Evans since Apostle, the 2018 horror featuring Michael Sheen which was filmed around Margam Park in Port Talbot. Tertzakian spent much of the pandemic in an Airbnb in Cardiff while Havoc was being filmed. Gareth brought me to Wales for this project because he is a great patriot and wanted to figure out how to make films in Wales, said Tertzakian. He said he believed that after Havoc, filmmakers and producers in the industry are going to be a lot more focused on Wales being on the map. I think it's always been seen as an option but when they see Havoc and what we pulled off, I think it's going to blow their minds and really make Wales a lot more viable for a lot of people. Wales is one of the good guys, he added. You've got really hard working crews, a lot of dedication and love for the game. You get some amazing locations, both interiors and exteriors and we had a blast. According to Netflix and Creative Wales, Havoc is the largest feature film ever to be shot entirely in Wales, with post production also completed in Cardiff. Netflix said its productions in Wales, which also include Sex Education, had generated more than £200m for the UK economy since 2020. Jack Sargeant, Wales' minister for culture, said productions like Havoc had delivered significant economic and reputational benefits. We are immensely proud of our Welsh creative industries, which employ over 35,000 talented individuals, and the world-class infrastructure we have in place for film and TV productions.",

    "section": "culture",
    "content": "Gwyneth Paltrow said she has returned to eating food she previously restricted, including sourdough bread, pasta and cheese, having been on a strict paleo diet for several years. The Oscar-winning US actress-turned-health guru has advocated for the benefits of a range of different diets while promoting her lifestyle business. Speaking on her most recent Goop podcast this week, she said: I went into hardcore macrobiotic for a certain time, that was an interesting chapter where I got obsessed with eating very, very healthily. Paltrow said she got into wellness and food because of her father's throat cancer but has now broadened out her food choices. Apaleo dietis based on the idea that if we eat like our ancient ancestors, we'll be healthier and reduce our risk of certain diseases. I really deepened my connection with food and the whole philosophy around macrobiotics, which is essentially just how they eat in the mountains of Japan, so very local, very seasonal, she explained. Lots of fish, vegetables, rice, no dairy, no sugar, etc. The star went on to admit that during that period of time she might have got a little didactic about it. I felt so good, I wanted to share that with my dad, my friends and family. She said she had become intoxicated by that idea that if she and her loved ones stayed hydrated and ate whole foods then we could just feel so much better. She added she still feels the same way today, to an extent, but that things had gotten a little more complicated as she had gotten older regarding inflammation and health stuff. It's the reason that Brad and I became paleo a few years ago now, although I'm a little bit sick of it, if I'm honest, she added, with reference to her husband Brad Falchuk, co-creator of the Glee TV series. I'm getting back into eating sourdough bread, and some cheese - there, I said it. A little pasta after being strict with it for so long. But again I think it's a good template, right? Eating foods that are as whole and fresh as possible. I don't think there is any doctor or nutritionist that would refute that, it's a good starting point. Priya Tew, specialist dietitian fromDietitian UKand media spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, said it was great to hear that Paltrow was adding back into her very restrictive diet. This is definitely a good thing, she told the BBC. Carbohydrates are a vital part of our diets, providing fibre, B vitamins and energy. They are also key for our gut microbiome and also bring taste and enjoyment to meals. It sounds like Gwyneth is moving towards a more balanced and nutritious diet, considering her realm of influence it is good to hear that she is finding this of benefit. She added: Nutrition research shows us that cutting out whole food groups is not good for our overall health. We need diversity and variety to help us meet all our nutritional needs, to bring taste into our diets and prevent boredom and to also bring pleasure! Having largely stepped away from Hollywood in recent times to focus on health and wellness, Paltrow is set to make her big screen return opposite Timothée Chalamet in the upcoming sports action movie Marty Supreme. She won the best actress Oscar in 1999 for starring in period drama Shakespeare In Love, and also featured in Sliding Doors and a string of later Marvel movies.",

    "title": "Woman who tricked her way into men-only Magic Circle finally allowed in",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy79nq4yz4o",
    "section": "culture",
    "content": "A magician who tricked her way into the Magic Circle is finally being granted membership - 34 years after she was kicked out. Sophie Lloyd says she disguised herself as a man to fool examiners into letting her join the elite society in 1991, at a time female magicians were not allowed to be members. When the Circle announced it was permitting women to join later that year, Ms Lloyd revealed her deception, prompting the society to expel her at the very same meeting it admitted its first female magicians. Following a public search to find her, the Circle has now apologised to Ms Lloyd and is presenting her with a membership certificate on Thursday evening. I'm beyond thrilled, Ms Lloyd toldRadio 4's Today programmeon Thursday. In the late 1980s, Ms Lloyd was studying at a school of mime in London where she befriended magician Jenny Winstanley. Jenny was increasingly frustrated that women, including herself, could not join the Magic Circle, Ms Lloyd said. So she came up with an idea to infiltrate the society by having me dress as a man. She couldn't do it herself as she was too recognisable. It was a colossal undertaking. Ms Lloyd had worked as Miss Winstanley's assistant at gigs but hadn't performed magic on her own, so had to learn. She invented a new identity - Raymond Lloyd - and spent about two years studying the character. She disguised herself with a wig, body suit and croaky voice. She wore gloves to hide her feminine hands. There was nothing she could do about her height - 5ft 2in (1.57m) - so instead she styled Raymond as a young-looking, 18-year-old, with some facial fluff, she told Canadian broadcasterCBCin 1991. Ms Lloyd told the Today programme that her character was totally believed. She had no problems wearing the body suit, but the gloves made it very hard to do sleight of hand tricks, she said. By March 1991, Ms Lloyd was ready to have her skills put to the test. Rather than being scrutinised at the Magic Circle's headquarters - which Ms Lloyd and Miss Winstanley deemed too risky - Ms Lloyd opted to invite the society's examiners to a 20-minute performance at a working men's club in front of 200 spectators. To cover up her voice, Ms Lloyd said Raymond had laryngitis. Ms Lloyd even stayed for a drink with one of the examiners after the show. A week later, Ms Lloyd was told she had been granted membership to the Circle. For months, Raymond Lloyd performed magic and even socialised with other Magic Circle members. When Ms Lloyd and Miss Winstanley later heard the society was going to begin accepting female magicians as members, they decided to come clean about their deception and Miss Winstanley told the society about it over the phone. But the Magic Circle did not take kindly to the news. The duo got a letter saying that Raymond had been expelled, and in October 1991, at the first meeting accepting women into the society, Ms Lloyd was kicked out. We couldn't get our heads round it, Ms Lloyd said. Ms Lloyd spent about 10 years performing across the country as a magician, including performing anti-bullying shows, before she moved to Spain, where she took early retirement and has been involved in animal rescue work. Miss Winstanley went on to run a pottery firm in Norfolk, before she died in a car crash in 2004. The Magic Circle started a search for Ms Lloyd last year. I felt it important that the Magic Circle should be able to recognise Sophie as the role model for women magicians, as well as show that we are now a completely open society, said Laura London, the society's first female chair. Ms Lloyd only found out about the search for her when her sister sent her a link to an interview. Initially reluctant to join the society because of the amount of time that had passed, she eventually decided to do it to honour Miss Winstanley's legacy. Today, the Magic Circle is still heavily male-dominated. The society has around 1,700 members, of which 5% are women. Ms Lloyd will receive her new membership certificate at an event at the Circle's London headquarters on Thursday evening, which will feature performances by five magicians and be attended by both members of the society and the general public. The society says Miss Winstanley will also be recognised at the event. This is for Jenny, really, Ms Lloyd said. I just think Jenny would have loved it.

    "title": "'We'll do Paddington proud' - Tom Fletcher reveals details of musical",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c793l125gwvo",
    "section": "culture",
    "content": "McFly star Tom Fletcher has said he felt overwhelming excitement working on the new Paddington stage musical, which producers have confirmed will open in November. The singer-songwriter said he hoped the music and lyrics he has written for the show would do Paddington proud, adding that the musical numbers are my favourite songs I've ever written. The show will open at the Savoy Theatre in the West End on 1 November, and follow Paddington as he arrives from Peru seeking a new home in London. The musical, which has been in development for five years, is based on Michael Bond's original novels and follows the hugely successful recent film series. Speaking about the show for the first time, Fletcher told BBC News he felt so honoured and lucky to be working on the project, which he said would reflect all of the fun, warmth and heart that the books and movies have captured so brilliantly. There is something so magical about seeing Paddington step out on to the stage, and seeing him... I was about to say in the flesh, but I guess in the fur is more accurate, he joked. Fletcher is best-known as the founding member of pop band McFly, whose hits include All About You, Obviously and Star Girl, and is also a successful children's author. He was first approached about Paddington around the time of the first Covid lockdown in early 2020, and workshopped the project with scriptwriter Jessica Swale, director Luke Sheppard and the producers before the showwas formally announced in 2023. With the musical now almost ready to launch, Swale told BBC News it would feature lots of juicy new material. We're bringing a lot of new flavours to the table, but of course we're all in love with the original material, so we've been faithful to our cast of characters, she said. Of course the Browns are part of it, and familiar faces like Mr Gruber and Mr Curry, but there are a lot of new people as well. We've been very inspired by the books and the films but we like to think we're covering new territory. Bond's first book in the series, A Bear Called Paddington, was published in 1958. The author went on to write 29 Paddington books in total, the final one being Paddington at St Paul's, which was published posthumously in 2018. The stories have sold more than 35 million copies worldwide. Fletcher said he relished the opportunity to find what the musical language of Paddington was. Having something that everybody knows but no-one's heard what it sounds like yet is a really exciting thing to be able to work on, he explained. He recalled that, when producer Eliza Lumley first called him about the project, he not only immediately replied with a very fast 'yes please', but began writing music for the show right away. While I was still on the phone to her, I had the idea for a song, so I went and wrote my first song for it that night, instantly after getting off the phone, and that song is still in the musical now. He reflected: My instant reaction wasn't to be intimidated, it was to be excited and just so inspired by these stories and films that I already knew, I just jumped straight at my piano and started writing. The three film adaptations of Paddington, featuring the voice of Ben Whishaw, have been a huge success at the box office since the first was released in 2014. In recent years, London has seen pop group Abba represented by virtual avatars on stage, while some animated film characters have been depicted using more traditional puppeteering methods, such as snowman Olaf in the stage adaptation of Frozen. It has not yet been revealed what approach producers will take to representing Paddington in the theatre. I don't know what you're talking about, he's a bear! joked Swale. He's travelling from Peru to be a special part of our show! She continued: I can't give away our secrets. One of the things I'm most excited about for this show is the character of Paddington.  Swale credits producers Lumley and Sonia Friedman for really experimenting with every possible way that we could tell the bear's story in the best way, and the magic that they've found in how they do it”, adding: “Every single time I see Paddington for the first time, it makes me cry. I think he's completely magic, and to me he's very real. But I don't think audiences will be disappointed. It's a wonderful, theatrical version of how to tell this story. As for the character himself, Swale noted the musical also reveals the spirit and the politics of Paddington. For example, Paddington is a refugee, so we want to honour the fact that he is somebody who migrates to the UK and doesn't have a home, and make sure we are conscious of the experience of who he represents. Between now and the show's opening in November, Fletcher said the team would be fine-tuning for as long as we can, and making sure that we get it absolutely right. He added: I really hope that I've done everyone who loves Paddington justice... This is so different to anything I've ever done before. I feel like this show is so ready to be out in the world, it's the most special thing I've ever been a part of in my whole life. The 39-year-old will be on tour with McFly and Busted when the musical opens in November, so I'll be going from touring with the band and then rushing back to London to fit it all in, he explained. It's a slightly hectic schedule, but we'll make it work somehow. I might get confused and start singing Paddington songs on stage with McFly. Most important, of course, is the question of whether or not Paddington's favourite food will feature in the stage adaptation. You can rest easy, laughed Swale. Marmalade features not only in the book and the lyrics, but physically on stage in a spectacular way.",

    "title": "Proms go dark: The Traitors and all-night concerts planned for 2025",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m9gllw4dzo",
    "section": "culture",
    "content": "Organisers of the BBC Proms are encouraging fans to stay up all night, with a magical and intimate after-hours concert at the Royal Albert Hall. Plans for the Dark Till Dawn Prom were unveiled in the programme announcing the summer festival, which will also feature one-handed pianist Nicholas McCarthy, rock star St Vincent and a celebration of film composer Bernard Herrmann. The ever-popular CBeebies Prom will return, and Claudia Winkleman will host a concert exploring the tense and haunting soundtrack to the hit TV show The Traitors. Highlights of the classical repertoire include Shoshtakovich's opera Lady Macbeth, and Korean sensation Yunchan Lim playing Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto No 4. On 5 September, Sir Simon Rattle will conduct Chineke! - Europe's first minority Black and ethnically diverse orchestra - for the first time. Their concert will include a performance of the final work by Pulitzer-winning US composer George Walker, which was written as a response to the2015 Charleston church shooting. Other stars gracing the 2025 season include soprano of the moment Aigul Akhmetshina, making her Proms debut, violinist Randall Goosby, sitar virtuoso Anoushka Shankar, Pakistani-American singer Arroj Aftab, and Grammy award-winner Angelique Kidjo. There will be 86 concerts in all, with a number taking place in Gateshead, Bristol, Bradford, Belfast and Sunderland. Tickets go on sale at 9am on 17 May. On-the-day Promming tickets are £8 including booking fees, and seated tickets start from £10 plus booking fees. The all-nighter, on 8 August, is being planned by organist Anna Lapwood, who said the idea had been several years in the making. I spend a lot of time at the Albert Hall in the middle of the night, practising, and I find it fascinating that the building is still just running overnight, she says. There are always people there - cleaners and security guards - a bit like A Night At The Museum. So we talked about how fun it would be to be able to invite people into that space, both physically, but also the abstract space of being in an iconic building in the middle of the night. Her programme will include YouTube pianist Hayato Sumino, Russian cellist Anastasia Kobekina and Norwegian ensemble Barroksolistene, whose Alehouse sessions aim to recreate the atmosphere of a 17th Century English tavern. Lapwood says the artists are all connected by an enthusiasm for messing around with music, citing Sumino's viral video of the seven degrees of Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star. There are various moments where we're hoping to do some collaborations, she reveals. But the logistics of this are all very, very complicated, not least trying to figure out everyone's sleep schedules! This summer's season is the first since the departure of Proms director David Pickard. He has been replaced by Hannah Donat who, as director of artistic planning, had shaped the festival alongside the controller of BBC Radio 3, Sam Jackson. I think of the Proms as the classical music equivalent of Wimbledon, she says. Everyone likes to go to Wimbledon, even if they don't watch tennis for the rest of the year; and everyone likes to go to a Prom, even if they're not going to concerts for the rest of the season. It gives the concerts a warmth and an informal atmosphere. People don't worry too much about knowing the repertoire inside out - there's just something spectacular about the Albert Hall and seeing the orchestra onstage.  Among the concerts to watch out for are: 19 July: The Great American Songbook and Beyond with Samara Joy. Fresh from winning best jazz album at this year's Grammys, US singer Samara Joy teams up with the BBC Concert Orchestra for a night of standards by Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Billie Holliday. 20 July: Ravel's Piano Concerto for the Left Hand. The world's only professional one-handed concert pianist, Nicholas McCarthy, makes his Proms debut, playing a concerto originally written for Paul Wittgenstein, after he lost his right arm during World War One. 26 July: The Traitors.I've asked for a cloak and an owl, says Claudia Winkelman, ahead of this one-off concert, featuring classical pieces with betrayal at their heart alongside the gothic re-workings of pop songs heard in the TV reality show. 2 August: Mahler's Resurrection Symphony. Canadian mezzo-soprano Emily D'Angelo, whose voice has been called a thing of wonder, makes her Proms debut with Norwegian soprano Mari Eriksmoen and the Hallé orchestra. 8 August: 100 Years of the Shipping Forecast. The subtle magic of the Shipping Forecast is celebrated in a special concert, in Belfast's Ulster Hall, featuring Radio 4's continuity announcers and a new work by poet laureate Simon Armitage. 9 August: The Planets and Star Wars.The National Youth Orchestra play two of the world's most recognisable pieces of orchestral music, with an intergalactic theme. 10 August: Edward Gardner Conducts the LPO.Taking a journey through icy waters and cascading waterfalls, the London Philharmonic present a quartet of pieces, including Debussy's La Mer and Sibelius's Oceanides - with an aquatic theme. Electrifying mezzo-soprano Aigul Akhmetshina joins in, for her Proms debut. 14 August: Joe Hisaishi and Steve Reich.Legendary Studio Ghibli composer Joe Hisaishi makes his Proms debut conducting the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in two large-scale works exploring themes of destruction and loss - including his piece The End of the World, reflecting the anxiety and chaos after the 2001 terrorist attacks in New York. 23 August: Mäkelä conducts Mahler's Fifth. Finnish conductor Klaus Mäkelä isn't yet 30, but his electrifying performances have already made headlines around the world. He comes to the Proms with the Dutch Concertgebouw Orchestra, to play Mahler's leonine fifth symphony. 7 September: Angelique Kidjo - African Symphony. I want to show the world the richness and beauty of African culture, says the Beninese-French music icon Angelique Kidjo of her return to the Proms. Part of Bradford's City of Culture programme, her concert will highlight iconic tracks from legends including Miriam Makeba, Fela Kuti and Youssou N'Dour. The season concludes with the traditional Last Night on 13 September, conducted by Elim Chan. Soprano Louise Alder and trumpeter Alison Balsom will make star turns, alongside the traditional medley of sea shanties, Pomp and Circumstance and Auld Lang Syne. The concert will also include Donat's favourite Easter egg for her first year in charge. There's a piece of music that I'd wanted to get into the Proms for some time, she says, referring to Arthur Benjamin's Storm Cloud Contata. The music was originally written for Alfred Hitchcock's spy thriller The Man Who Knew Too Much in 1934; and re-arranged by Bernard Herrmann for Hitchcock's Hollywood remake in 1956. The final scene takes place in the Albert Hall, explains Donat, and while Jimmy Stewart's chasing this assassin around the building, Bernard Herrmann is conducting the orchestra on stage - and that's the piece we're including in the Last Night of the Proms. It's one of those little winks to the audience that I like to include during the season. For those who cannot attend, all of the concerts will be broadcast on BBC Radio 3 and BBC Sounds, and 25 of the nights will be televised.",

    "content": "From the latest season of the dystopian workplace drama to the UK miniseries that got the world talking and a new hit medical show, we pick the year's greatest programmes to stream right now. Hollywood is an easy target, butthis satireis so sharp, astute and sometimes absurd that it may be the funniest show of the year. Seth Rogen, who co-created the show, plays Matt Remick, the newly appointed head of Continental Studios, a lover of high-art films with a mandate to make commercial hits based on IP including Kool-Aid. A flood of actors and directors – including Ron Howard, Olivia Wilde and Zoe Kravitz – make cameo appearances, gleefully spoofing their own images, none funnier than Martin Scorsese in the hilarious opening episode. The series regulars are ideally cast, with Ike Barniholtz as Sal Saperstein, Matt's second-in-command, Catherine O'Hara as the previous studio head and Kathryn Hahn as the loud, wackily-dressed head of publicity. Taking us into the Golden Globes and marketing meetings, The Studio suggests that everyone is just bumbling along at a moment when the entire movie industry is in crisis. The industry might not know where it's going, but this behind-the-scenes comedy is a pure delight. (CJ) Available on Apple TV+ internationally One thing's for sure: if Mike White's first-world-problems satire about rich holidaymakers was admired by many for its first two seasons, it broke out to become a true cultural phenomenon in its third, witha huge ratings boost. This time round, it sent its dysfunctional groupings – a corrupt financier and his family, three clashing female friends, a vengeful man and his younger girlfriend – to a Thai wellness retreat, and every week, you could not move online (metaphorically) for thediscourse it generatedand debate it stirred. Some complained that this season was too slow and lacked suitable plot momentum, while others pointed out, sagely, that the problem was that it was a character-led drama that was never meant to be dissected like Game of Thrones, but for its unexpected blockbuster popularity. Personally? I enjoyed it as both the darkest and most reflective series so far, but one which again thrived off a magisterially cast ensemble, in which Parker Posey, Carrie Coon, Aimee Lou Wood and Patrick Schwarzenegger were standouts, but no one was a weak link. (HM) Available on Max in the US and Now in the UK It's no wonder that this uncompromising British series about a 13-year-old boy accused of murdering a girl in his school has become a cultural flashpoint, praised by UK Prime MinisterSir Keir Starmer, made available to be shown inschoolsand sparking conversations about young men and the toxic influence of social media. The social issue is wrapped in a drama brilliantly personalized and brought to life by the actors. Stephen Graham, who created the show with Jack Thorne, plays the boy's father and conveys the shock and grief of a parent forced to consider the unthinkable possibility that his son might be a killer. Owen Cooper gives a remarkably sophisticated performance as the accused boy, who seems guileless until he explodes in anger. And Ashley Waters plays a detective who struggles to understand his own teenage son, expanding the theme beyond one family. Each episode was shot in a single, real-time take, which sounds like a gimmick, but director Philip Barantini handles that approach so smoothly that it fades into the background, even while adding intensity to a piercing drama that offers no comfortable resolution. (CJ) Available on Netflix internationally Fairly or not, Apple TV+ has become a streamer known for ploughing huge resources (over $20bn, reportedly) into a range of starry shows that not very many people watch – but with the second series of this dystopian workplace drama, it became clear it had a genuine watercooler hit on its hands. Which is even more surprising, when you consider just how strange Severance is. Its compelling high-concept premise – in which employees of the sinister Lumon corporation have their consciousness separated into office selves, or innies, and home selves, or outies – is one thing, but beyond that, it is constantly taking the story down surreal rabbit holes, involving for example, mysterious macrodata refinement work or a herd of goats. In truth, as this series progressed through its second half, it felt a little too meandering for its own good, and its climactic payoff couldn't match that from the first season. But it's still an exquisite work in all areas, from the clever dual-identity acting (especially from shining star Britt Lower) to the stark visuals. Bring on season three, and perhaps a few more solid answers as to what'sreallygoing on at Lumon. (HM) Available on Apple TV+ internationally It might sound like just another medical drama, but this show about a trauma centre in Pittsburgh revitalises the genre with its attention to the psychological stress on caregivers. Noah Wyle gives a shattering performance as the department head, the dedicated, harried, emotionally wracked Dr Robbie, still traumatised after failing to save his mentor during the Covid-19 pandemic. He is surrounded by other doctors and a group of students and interns, each adding a different dimension, from Supriya Ganesh as a brilliant medical prodigy to Isa Briones as an abrasive intern and Taylor Dearden as the caring Dr Mel, whose neurodivergence makes her especially empathetic with her patients. Unlike most medical shows, The Pitt never lets their personal melodrama overwhelm the focus on their work. Each absorbing, fast-paced episode takes place in real time during one 15-hour-long shift, and each veers between the devastation of losing patients and the relief of saving them. You'd think a series so blunt about death would be depressing, but instead The Pitt is exhilarating in its focus on people for whom life and death are everyday events. (CJ) Available on Max in the US It's difficult to discuss the power of this show without giving away the key twist that comes at the end of episode one. But safe to say, it turns what starts as a relatively conventional political thriller on its head. Sterling K Brown is the head of the US president's security detail, who finds himself accused of murder of his boss – but above and beyond the killing itself, not everything seems quite right with the world. Created by Dan Fogelman, the man behind the equally rug-pulling TV weepieThis is Us, this is solid entertainment in the very best sense, with sharp plotting matched by some strong performances, from Brown’s tortured hero to Julianne Nicholson as a sinister tech billionaire. Plus, later on in the series, one particular episode which deals with truly monumental matters is simply breathtaking – but again, that's all that can be said without spoiling things for those yet to watch. The good news for those that have is that it's already been recommissioned. (HM) Available on Hulu in the US and Disney+ internationally The sumptuous conclusion to this adaptation of Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall trilogy blends a beautifully shot escape into the luxurious past of Henry VIII's court with an evergreen depiction of the high personal cost of manoeuvring for power and influence. Mark Rylance is poignant as the king's advisor,Thomas Cromwell, who questions his own decisions, while the mercurial Henry is losing confidence in him. And Damian Lewis's fresh interpretation of Henry is dazzling, his voice and manner chillingly subdued even as he issues the most ruthless commands. Henry's wives come and go, but the unravelling bond between these men, and their opposite trajectories – Cromwell's self-doubts and decline and Henry's iron will that eliminates anyone in his way – shape the story. Written by Peter Straughn, a recent Oscar winner for his screenplay ofConclave, The Mirror and the Light is more resonant today than the original Mantel book was when it was published in 2020. It feels entirely relevant in a world where creeping authoritarianism is a global concern. (CJ) Available on PBS in the US and BBC iPlayer in the UK Since breaking out in HBO teen drama Euphoria, rising star Jacob Elordi has chosen his roles well – but perhaps nothing has served him better so far than returning to his home country of Australia to play the protagonist in this searing war drama. An adaptation of Richard Flanagan's Booker Prize-winning novel, it explores the life of World War Two army surgeon Dorrigo Evans across three time periods: his stint stationed in Adelaide for military training, his hellish experiences as a prisoner of war in the Thai jungle, and then his existence as a professionally successful but emotionally deeply troubled veteran (now played by Ciarán Hinds), still unable to truly process the events of decades ago. Brought to impactful visual life by Justin Kurzel, known for his visceral studies of male violence on the big screen like Snowtown andThe Order, it is simply one of the best evocations of the horrors of conflict that has been committed to screen. But at the same time, it takes as much care in its exploration of passion as violence, with the chemistry between Elordi's young Dorrigo and his uncle's wife Amy (a superb Odessa Young) burning up the screen. Given some of the scenes of sadistic brutality, it is of course a difficult watch, as it should be, but also one whose sheer artistry offers a kind of transcendence. (HM) Available on Prime Video in the US, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada Jon Hamm has never been better, expertly mixing comedy and drama in this series about a hedge-fund manager called Coop, who loses his job. He schemes to keep up appearances in his wealthy community, only to discover a new sense of himself. The show has a broad comic element, as Coop turns cat burglar, solving his financial problems by stealing luxury items from his neighbours. But the series is best in its bold take on what he calls in one of his mordant voiceovers, the quiet desperation of rich middle-aged men, and in its depiction of his complicated relationships. He is still emotionally attached to his ex-wife (Amanda Peet), who left him for one of his friends, and struggles to connect with his two teenage children. He has a tender, supportive bond with his emotionally fragile sister (Lena Hall, a standout in the cast). Hamm hasn't had a role this rich since Don Draper inMad Men, another flawed but sympathetic charmer who makes some wildly bad decisions, and defines the character so perfectly that it's hard to imagine anyone else at the centre of this sleek but penetrating series. (CJ) Available on AppleTV+ internationally It might have created a little less noise than Adolescence, but here is another British show about masculinity that really deserves to be seen. Jack Rooke's semi-autobiographical show about two university students who form an odd-couple friendship – nerdy gay man Jack and straight jack-the-lad Dan – has been an incredibly deft mix of laugh-out-loud humour, complete with delightfully niche pop culture references, and poignant drama – covering sexual awakening, depression, dementia and more besides – since it started in 2022. But this third and final series was undoubtedly its most powerful, kicking off with a hilarious episode on a package holiday in Greece but getting more serious as it continued, and handling Danny's spiralling mental health problems with particular skill. And boy, does Rooke know how to shatter audience hearts – the final episode is an emotional masterclass, including a significant cameo from the man himself. Here's hoping that it launches its extremely talented creator into the big time.

    "content": "From Drop to A Minecraft Movie, these are the films to stream at home and watch at the cinema this month. David Cronenberg's latest sci-fi-tinged drama stars Vincent Cassel as Karsh, an inventor who looks a lot like Cronenberg himself. Grief-stricken by the death of his wife (Diane Kruger), Karsh develops camera systems that can be buried with corpses, so that their relatives can watch them on monitors as they decompose. The invention catches on, but one night some graves containing these high-tech shrouds are desecrated, so Karsh and his brother-in-law (Guy Pearce) have to work out who was responsible. This may sound like the kind of scenario that the director of Scanners and The Fly might use to justify lots of gory body horror, but The Shrouds is a restrained, even elegant film inspired by Cronenberg's own bereavement,says Steve Pond at The Wrap. It's a deeply personal look at loss that finds plenty of time to get creepy but never loses sight of the fact that it's a movie about grief… Its focus, which never wavers, is always on the feeling of loss, not the sight of gore. Released on 18 April in the US Three of Hollywood's brightest young stars get together in On Swift Horses, a handsome period romance directed by Daniel Minhan and adapted from Shannon Pufahl's novel. Daisy Edgar-Jones plays Muriel, the fiancée of an upstanding Korean War veteran, Lee (Will Poulter). He is looking forward to a traditional family life in California in the go-getting 1950s, but when his younger brother Julius (Jacob Elordi) comes to stay, Julius's gay relationships and gambling sprees help Muriel to understand why she is attracted to women and drawn to betting on horse races.Graham Guttman at Screen Rant calls the filma quietly devastating [story of] great pain and even greater love, all of which is portrayed beautifully by the film's all-star cast, adding: On Swift Horses, with its sweeping romance and epic nature, feels outside of time, transcending any issues to become something deeply affecting. On the other hand,the BBC's Caryn James considers ita disappointment [that] works much better as an idea than as a film. Released on 25 April in the US and Canada, and on 30 April in France On a remote island in Eastern Europe, fanged and furry monsters called Ochi lurk in the forests. A farmer (Willem Dafoe) is obsessed by hunting them, but when his shy teenage daughter (Helena Zengel) finds an injured baby Ochi, it turns out to be a big-eyed, pointy-eared beastie that bears a striking resemblance to Gizmo from Gremlins and Grogu from The Mandalorian. The girl then defies her father and takes the creature back to its family – a journey that is visualised using practical rather than digital effects. The Legend of Ochi, the rare A24 family film, is a charming throwback to adventure movies of the 80s like The Neverending Story and The Dark Crystal,says Brian Tallerico at RogerEbert.com, complete with original puppetry that reportedly contains not an ounce of CGI manipulation. It feels like a family film made by flesh-and-blood people in an era when computers are doing so much of the work. Released on 25 April in the US, the UK, Canada and Ireland Ryan Coogler has already put his own personal stamp on the sports drama (Creed) and the superhero blockbuster (Black Panther), and now, with Sinners, the writer-director takes on gothic horror. His favourite leading man, Michael B Jordan, plays two gun-toting twin brothers, Smoke and Stack, who go back to their rural hometown in 1930s Louisiana, only to find that the local blues music can pierce the veil between life and death. The town is soon infested with vampires – but don't think of Sinners as a straightforward vampire chiller. The film is very genre-fluid,Coogler said in The Hollywood Reporter. It switches in and out of a lot of different genres. Yes, vampires are an element, but it's not the only supernatural element in the movie... I'm blessed to have found this medium that I can work out deep philosophical and existential questions that I may be struggling with while contributing to an art form that means so much to my family. Released internationally on 18 April First dates can be awkward, but not many are as awkward as the one in Drop, a high-concept one-location thriller from Christopher Landon, the writer-director of Happy Death Day and Freaky. Meghann Fahy stars as a single mother, Violet, who agrees to have dinner with the eligible Henry (Brandon Sklenar) in a Chicago skyscraper's restaurant. Everything is going smoothly until someone in the restaurant starts sending threatening messages to Violet's phone. She is told that there is an intruder in her home, and that unless she poisons Henry, her five-year-old son will be killed. [Fahy's] dialled-in performance is thankfully matched by an overarching crispness to the proceedings,says Adrian Horton in The Guardian. Just enough flourishes, an enjoyable but not unbearable amount of stress, no wasted time, a perfect match of star, script and style. For those who sort for lean and limber in their thrillers, Drop is a date worth making. Released internationally on 11 April When Alex Garland was making his last film,Civil War, his military advisor for the battle sequences was Ray Mendoza, an Iraq War veteran. This collaboration prompted Garland and Mendoza to co-direct another film, a faithful recreation of a battle which Mendoza himself was in, that plays out in real time over 90 minutes. D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai plays Mendoza (alongside Will Poulter, Joseph Quinn and Charles Melton) in what some critics are calling cinema's most authentic and immersive ever depiction of a wartime firefight. It's a film that pushes the war is hell concept to its logical, visceral and most infernal conclusion,says Kevin Maher in The Times. This is a movie that's as difficult to watch as it is to forget. It's a sensory blitz, a percussive nightmare and a relentless assault on the soul. Released on 11 April in the US and Canada, 16 April in Spain, 17 April in Australia, Brazil and Germany, and 18 April in the UK If you finished watching Peter Jackson's series, The Beatles: Get Back, and you wanted to know what John Lennon got up to after the Fab Four broke up, then One to One: John & Yoko could be the film for you. Directed by Kevin Macdonald (One Day in September, Marley) along with Sam Rice-Edwards, the documentary chronicles the 18 months in the early 1970s when Lennon and Yoko One lived in Greenwich Village, New York. It covers the only full-length concert Lennon played after his time in The Beatles – but that was just one of the couple's many endeavours during their stay in the Big Apple. Drawing on televised interviews, taped phone calls with agents and managers, and personal film footage,says David Hughes in Time Out, Macdonald charts the couple's determination to fight for any worthy cause that crosses their eyeline, from the Vietnam War to fundraising for remanded prisoners unable to afford bail. The pair's artistry, individually and collectively, seems to be matched only by their energy and moral clarity. Released on 11 April in the US, the UK and Ireland What if Die Hard was set at a meeting of the world's most powerful political leaders? And what if the US president in Air Force One was a woman? The answer to both of these questions can be found in G20, a gleefully over-the-top action thriller directed by Patricia Riggen. Viola Davis stars as US President Danielle Sutton, who is at a G20 summit in South Africa when a terrorist group takes the guests hostage. What the bad guys (led by Antony Starr from The Boys) haven't counted on is that the POTUS is an army veteran, and even when she's wearing a cocktail dress, she can fight with the best of them. It was the sort of thing you'd imagine as a kid, just playing the most heroic character you could possibly play,Davis told Variety. The only question the film doesn't answer is whether the sequel will be called G21. Released on 10 April on Prime A Minecraft Movie is a children's adventure co-starring Jack Black, and adapted from a video game about a colourful fantasy world being threatened by infernal invaders. Does that sound familiar? If so, it's because the very same summary applies to The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Still, that was the second highest grossing film of 2023, so maybe A Minecraft Movie will be just as lucrative. The difference is that the new film, which also stars Jason Momoa and Jennifer Coolidge, has live-action actors in a CGI world. Also, it's directed by Jared Hess, the maker of such eccentric comedies as Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre. By some force of alchemy, his cockeyed look at things – a mix of deadpan delivery, garish colours, and exaggerated interactions – is weirdly perfect for this adaptation,says Jordan Hoffman in Entertainment Weekly. There's an 'anything goes' attitude here… [and] this loosey-goosey attitude is a breath of fresh air after so many family films that seem preordained by lore. Released internationally on 4 April With a dynamic that's not a million miles away from the central relationship in A Real Pain, Sacramento is an indie comedy about two mismatched male friends – one neurotic, the other annoyingly outgoing – embarking on a trip together. Glenn, played by Michael Cera, is even more anxious than usual because he is about to become a father, while the extrovert Rickey, played by Michael Angarano, is traumatised by the death of his own father. Could a weekend in Sacramento, California help them to overcome all of their issues? Angarano is also the co-writer, co-producer and director of a film that features both his ex-partner, Kristen Stewart, and his current partner, Maya Erskine.David Ehrlich at IndieWire says that Angaranograduates from overeager dilettante to unusually shrewd comic director with Sacramento. Its casual nature and outward lack of ambition belie how well it manages to convey the terror that change brings into our lives, the mania of trying to deny it, and the relief that comes from recognising that someone else in your world is changing with you. Released on 11 April in the US Ang Lee's second film, The Wedding Banquet, was a romantic comedy about a gay Taiwanese New Yorker who marries a Chinese woman so that she can get a green card, only for his unwitting parents to mark the occasion with a lavish party. The film made Lee's name as a director when it was released in 1993, and it went on to be nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe. Now it has been remade by Andrew Ahn (Fire Island), with a stellar cast that includes Bowen Yang (Wicked), Lily Gladstone (Killers of the Flower Moon) and Kelly Marie Tran (Star Wars: The Last Jedi). Ahn moves the story to Seattle, adds a subplot about fertility treatment, and rejigs the nationalities and generations so that the visiting relative is now a grandmother (Minari's Youn Yuh-jung) from South Korea. An intended marriage of convenience still lies at its heart,says Amber Wilkinson in Screen Daily, but the relationships are given a modern makeover as Ahn probes questions of commitment and celebrates the families we choose to make for ourselves.

    "content": "Esoteric and pioneering, the paintings of a lesser-known Pre-Raphaelite, Evelyn De Morgan, explored the trauma and meaning of war – and prefigured current fantasy art. On a rocky beach that glows red with lava, smoke-breathing dragons surround wretched-looking prisoners beseeching an angel to deliver them from suffering. The oil painting Death of the Dragon by Evelyn De Morgan looks at first like a scene from the New Testament's apocalyptic Book of Revelation. But, painted between 1914 and 1918, it's also something more personal and critical: an allegory for the misery and bondage of World War One, and the confrontation between good and evil. The spectacular painting, measuring more than a metre high, is one of the highlights of a new exhibition,Evelyn De Morgan: The Modern Painter in Victorian London, at London's Guildhall Art Gallery, home to the City of London Corporation's art collection. On display are rarely seen works from theDe Morgan Foundation, as well as twonewly-restored paintingsand two recreations, completed just last year, of works lost in an art warehouse fire in 1991. The show coincides with the reopening of the De Morgan Museum in Barnsley, Yorkshire, following an extensive roof renovation, and responds to arising interestin this lesser-known artist. She has tended to be eclipsed by her husband William – a ceramicist and writer, who had worked early in his career with the textile designerWilliam Morris– and the famous men in their circle: her uncle and art teacher, John Roddam Spencer Stanhope, for example, and the painters William Holman Hunt andDante Gabriel Rossetti. Much of what we know about De Morgan today comes from her sister Wilhelmina, who set up the De Morgan Foundation, but even she saw fit to publish the couple's posthumous biography under the title William De Morgan and his Wife. Yet, Evelyn De Morgan more than deserves the art world's belated acclaim. A Slade graduate, who was working at the tail end of the Pre-Raphaelite movement, she took the arguably twee or overly sentimental genre into new territory, creating tableaux that were unusually visionary and energetic. The women she portrayed were less passive than thosedepicted by her contemporaries, and featured as symbols of agency rather than objects of the male gaze. Instead of a drowned body floating down the river, as in Sir John Everett Millais'Ophelia, or figures whose main currency wastheir looks, we meet a skilledsorceress creating magical potionsandflying superheroineswho can cast rain, thunder and lightning from their fingers. These goddess-like figures show the influence of the classical art that De Morgan had studied. Immaculately executed works such asBoreas and Oreithyia(1896) reveal her interest in mythology and her mastery of the human form, reminiscent of Michelangelo. In Death of the Dragon, in terms of composition, it's easy to see the influence of Sandro Botticelli'sThe Birth of Venus(1483–1485), which De Morgan had visited in Florence. If De Morgan's haloed angel echoes this idea of rebirth − reflecting the artist's belief in a spiritual afterlife − then the winged beasts are its counterpart, Death, always biting at the heels of the people and threatening to overcome them. Elsewhere in her work, Death takes alternative forms: adark angel bearing a scythe,sea monstersor – more obliquely –a sand timer. It's a symbolism that speaks to life's transience, and acquires additional poignancy in her later work, conveying the collective trauma of living through a World War that claimed close to a million British lives. During the First World War they [the De Morgans] were in London, so they would have been directly affected, Jean McMeakin, Chair of the Board of Trustees of the De Morgan Foundation, tells the BBC. Death was real for them in a way that perhaps we've largely forgotten these days, she points out. Members of William's family died from tuberculosis, and his own health was often quite poor. Death was, in a way, always present in the background. More like this: •Why this iconic 1839 painting is not what it seems •The surprising story of Van Gogh's guardian angel •Nine striking, rare photos of 19th-Century America De Morgan was a pacifist and her art became a form of activism. InOur Lady of Peace(1907), a response to the Boer Wars, a knight pleads for protection and peace, while inThe Poor Man who Saved the City(1901), wisdom and diplomacy are advocated as alternatives to military intervention. Later, inThe Red Cross(1914-16), angels carry the crucified Christ over a withered landscape pierced by Belgian war graves – a suggestion, perhaps, that the Christian faith is at odds with the brutality of war, but offers us hope of redemption. You must never praise war, De Morgan declared in The Result of an Experiment (1909), a book ofautomatic writingco-authored with her husband. The Devil invented it, and you can have no conception of its horrors. The idea of the forces of good and evil acting upon ordinary people was pervasive at this time. Spiritualism was quite popular, asserts McMeakin, citing the author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle – the creator of Sherlock Holmes – as one of its most famous adherents. Other-worldly beliefs, she says, were probably the result of the turmoil, the massive changes happening in society leading up to the turn of the century, plus a period of many wars, which would have had an impact on their view of the world. Doubtless, De Morgan was also influenced by her mother-in-law, Sophia, a well-known spiritualist and medium. With so many lives lost, it was no doubt tempting to believe that you could reconnect with the departed. For De Morgan, materialism was in opposition to spirituality, and many of her works conflate the pursuit of wealth with death. Crowns, as worn by the winged serpents in Death of the Dragon, are a repeated motif denoting greed and miserliness. InEarthbound(1897), an avaricious king in a gold cloak patterned with coins is about to be overwhelmed by the angel of death, while inThe Barred Gate(c.1910-1914), a similar figure is denied entry to Heaven. With the future so uncertain, De Morgan places the importance of spiritual fulfilment and happiness at the centre of much of her work. InBlindness and Cupidity Chasing Joy from the City(1897), for example, Cupidity is personified as a crowned figure clutching treasures who is driving away Joy in the form of an angel. Here, as in Death of the Dragon, the central characters are chained, suggesting trapped souls. InThe Prisoner(1907-1908), the barred window and a woman's chained wrists make captivity a metaphor for gender inequality, hinting at the De Morgans' support foruniversal suffrage(Evelyn was a signatory of at least two important petitions, while her husband was vice-president of the Men's League for Women's Suffrage). The theme recurs inLuna(1885), where the rope-bound body of a moon goddess, a mythological figure of feminine power, functions as a metaphor for a woman's struggle to influence her own destiny. Christened Mary, Evelyn later adopted her then-gender-neutral middle name, as women's art was not taken seriously. She wanted to be considered on the same level as her male peers, says McMeakin. We can assume a huge degree of self-possession and determination in her desire to become a professional artist, she adds, making the point that even De Morgan's mother opposed her career choice. Technically, De Morgan was also a pioneer. She experimented with burnishing and rubbing gold pigment into her works to add depth and interest, and explored new painting techniques invented by her husband, made by grinding colours with glycerine and spirit. Stylistically, she was also ahead of her time. The unconventional use of pinks and purples, and the bold rings of rainbow-coloured light, prefigure thepsychedelic painting stylesof the 1970s, while her terrifying monsters would not look out of place incontemporary fantasy art. While art history has tended to paint women as virgin mothers, objects of beauty or temptresses, De Morgan's specifically female perspective recasts them as figures of hope that augur an alternative, brighter future. InLux in Tenebris(light in darkness) (1895), for example, the female figure holds an olive branch in her right hand, offering a pathway to peace. In Death of the Dragon, the angel is surrounded by a magnificent rainbow: a symbol (along with the sky) of joy that denotes spiritual fulfilment and freedom, as well as the promise of an afterlife. It's a mistake to think of works such as Death of the Dragon as completely bleak, argues McMeakin, noting that often with [her] apocalyptic scenes, there is a glimmer of hope, or a part of the painting that is calm. In many ways, Death of the Dragon is optimistic, expressing a sense that the war – the metaphorical dragon – is nearing its end, and that good can overcome evil. In this existential battle, De Morgan saw a place for her work. When she was aged  just 17, she chastised herself for not painting enough. Art is eternal, but life is short, she wrote in her diary. I will make up for it now, I have not a moment to lose.

    "section": "culture",
    "content": "Tragedy Titus Andronicus is the Bard's goriest work, and a new production is set to be one of the most extreme takes on it yet. It raises the question: why do we watch such brutality? Good theatre has the power to really move us – a statement that's usually taken metaphorically, rather than literally. Yet when it comes to Shakespeare's bloodiest play, Titus Andronicus, its impact can be so visceral it causes audience members to faint. I should know: while reviewing a production atShakespeare's Globein London, back in 2014, its disturbingly violent scenes caused me to start to feel light-headed, even while safely sat down in my seat. Unfortunately, it was a bench with no back: before the end of the first half, I had fainted away completely, falling backwards and waking up in a stranger's lap. Warning: this article contains some graphic descriptions of violence And I was far from the only person to have such a full-bodied response to Lucy Bailey's production of this gory revenge tragedy: the press went wild forstories of droppers, with more than 100 people fainting during the run – testament to the immense power of Shakespeare's writing, and the skill of performers, as well as to the props department's handling of litres of fake blood. One of the Bard's earliest plays, written in 1591-2, and almost certainly his first tragedy, Titus Andronicus is a story of violent vengeance: Titus, a general of Rome, returns from wars against the Goths with their queen, Tamora, and her sons held as captives. When her eldest son is sacrificed by Titus, Tamora swears revenge – setting in motion a series of increasingly brutal acts that ends  with an infamous scene involving the baking of pies... Boasting 14 deaths, it is the most violent of all Shakespeare's plays – and now it's back on stage, with a new production opening at the UK's Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon. The play's unavoidable ultra-violence has meant that, for much of the performance history of Shakespeare – whose birthday is today – Titus Andronicus was considered a bit of an embarrassment, a bloody stain on his reputation: too gruesome, too over-the-top, to be considered in the same category of greatness as, say, Hamlet or Othello. Then there's its sometimes queasy tone: the excesses can tip Titus into a gleefully macabre, manic comedy (an aspect also embraced in Bailey's gore-fest). Let's just say, the Victorians were not fans. But the play's reputation began to revive in the second half of the 20th Century. At the Royal Shakespeare Company alone, there have been several seminal productions in the past 70 years, starring Laurence Olivier (1955), Patrick Stewart (1981), Brian Cox (1987) and David Bradley (2003), while Anthony Hopkins playing Titus on screen in Julie Taymor's influential, blackly funny film version in 1999 also surely helped boost the play's standing. Some of these productions leaned heavily on the horror, too: there were fainters and walk-outs in Deborah Warner's unflinching 1987 production, which Coxonce claimedwas the most interesting play he'd done and the best stage performance he'd ever given. But he also pointed to the odd humour of the play, calling it a young man's play… full of energy, joie de vivre and laughter that often strikes people as ludicrous. Titus is notalwaysstaged with grisly literalness: in the Olivier-starring production by Peter Brook, the mutilation of Titus's daughter Lavinia was famously suggested with stylised red streamers – an aestheticised approach also used in the Japanese Ninagawa Company's production in the 2000s. More recently, Jude Christian's all-female 2023 production in London's candle-lit Sam Wanamaker Playhouse enacted the violence on candles themselves, with cast members stabbing, snapping or snuffing them. In the latest production of Titus Andronicus, however, there will be blood. Buckets of it. We are doing gallons of blood. We've made a sort of wet room [on stage], it's got a drainage system and an abattoir hook… says Max Webster, the play's director, over a video call from Stratford-upon-Avon. He's had to figure out how to stage no fewer than 27 different acts of onstage violence, from punches through to limbs being lopped off and tongues being cut out. And the only limit on the amount of gore sloshing around is the practical question of how to clean it up between scenes. It's an unbelievably boring thing about how many crew members and squeegees it takes, laughs Webster. In one sentence, you're thinking 'what is the meaning of tragedy in relation to human nature?' – and then very quickly you get into 'how many mops can the crew hold?'. Webster, whose acclaimed productions include an adaptation of Booker Prize winner Life of Pi and a recent David Tennant-starringMacbeth, wanted to direct Titus Andronicus for one simple reason: Simon Russell Beale, one of Britain's greatest Shakespearean actors, asked him to. Titus was a part that Russell Beale fancied a crack at, and the RSC was happy to oblige. This version is updated – set in a crisp, besuited modern world riven by conflict, although where exactly is kept deliberately vague. It's trying to be open – we're not setting it in Kosovo or Gaza or Sudan, says Webster, adding swiftly And we're not going to try to produce the US army onstage or something – it's trying to make sense of Rome as a 'superpower of empire' rather than as 'the United States of America'. Still, he sees Titus as freshly, troublingly relevant, in light of shocking events such as the 7 October Hamas attacks, the war in Gaza, and the sudden invasion of Russian troops into Ukraine, the story's extreme violence doesn't seem so unimaginable. In this production, the violence is certainly no laughing matter. In rehearsals, they have been playing it entirely seriously, and eschewing the blackly cartoonish or stylishly Tarantino-esque approach to the violence that some directors explore. This has risks: Webster fully expects that, when the show is in front of an audience, there may be some nervous laughter; it'll be their job in previews to figure out where these laughs form a necessary pressure release valve, and where they're really just a sign to make the show even more harrowing. For Webster, it isn't possible to laugh at the brutality of Titus Andronicus in 2025 – it's too real. He sees the play as a howl of pain; watching it becomes an act of witness, an attempt to face up to atrocities taking place right now – something that he acknowledges could be hard for an audience. I can walk down the Avon [river], and know my family is safe and it doesn't feel like the world is burning. But you look at other parts of the world… these horrors, that maybe feel historical to us, are actually happening. But Titus Andronicus isn't a documentary; it's an old play, that people choose to stage and choose to pay to go to see. So why, when we could just watch the news, do we opt to watch such harrowing content as art, as entertainment? It's a question that partly motivated Russell Beale to do Titus,he told The Guardianlast week: I don't understand the violence. I don't understand why as an audience we feel excited, stimulated, challenged by it; it's so relentless. It may have been shunned in later centuries, but Titus Andronicus's original audiences loved it – and many other forms of graphically horrible entertainment, from bear baiting to public hangings. Titus was a hit in Elizabethan England, and in writing it Shakespeare may, in fact, have been playing to the crowd: it resembles the super-violent revenge tragedies that were popular at the time, rarely-staged works such as Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy and Thomas Middleton's The Revenger's Tragedy. Such plays were, themselves, drawing inspiration from the incredibly bloody and outrageous tragedies written by Seneca in the First Century AD – including Thyestes, a source of direct inspiration for Shakespeare, where the title character is fed a pie made of the flesh of his own children. And obviously, Ancient Greek tragedies – even if they keep acts of violence off-stage – are a rich and enduring source of creative murders of family members and cycles of bloody revenge. Such tragedies, Webster points out, had their origins in ritual performances of sacrifice. I guess theatre came out of killing goats in Ancient Greece… there's always been some relationship between theatre and violence and the sacred stuff. More like this: •Edward II: Did a gay love affair spark a royal crisis? •The Shakespeare words you don't know you know •The Shakespeare tragedy that speaks to us now It does seem that watching the very worst things imaginable unfolding has an irresistible appeal – not only do we still return to Greek or Shakespearean tragedies, but we've also turned death and violence into major sources of entertainment, apparently appropriate for daily consumption. Horror films, true crime podcasts, police procedurals, first-person shooter video games… depictions of very, very bad things happening to bodies are pervasive across all art forms, all the time. You might even say we're addicted to the adrenaline shot we get from such emotionally-wringing, extreme forms of entertainment:research showsthat the blood-pumping, heart-racing high we get from fear is close to the pleasurable bodily experience of excitement. From the high body count of fantasy shows likeGame of ThronesandHouse of the Dragonto the dystopian chills ofSquid Gameto the seemingly endless appetite for the torture porn movies of the Saw franchise, much of our creative output would make Seneca smack his lips in approval. But beyond the potential physical thrills, why are we so drawn to watching such violent content? When I ask Webster, he's as unsure as Russell Beale. The truth is, I don't know. But thereisa lust to watch violence on-stage – it is a basic human urge. He wonders if it forms a safe outlet for our innate human darkness. And a common theory as to why we enjoy the terrors of a horror movie or the bleakness of a dystopian novel is just this: that such fictional outings are a secure way for us to rehearse terrible acts – without ever having to experience those in real life. Maybe it is so we don't have to do [violence] in our lives? Webster ponders. We all have these weird, dark, turbulent fantasies that we don't talk about because they're not socially acceptable… so maybe seeing it on-stage is an escape, or a relief? The academics Haiyang Yang and Kuangjie Zhang confirm Webster's theory, sharing research in theHarvard Business Reviewthat found that horror entertainment may help us (safely) satisfy our curiosity about the dark side of human psyche… As an inherently curious species, many of us are fascinated by what our own kind is capable of. Observing storylines in which actors must confront the worst parts of themselves serves as a pseudo character study of the darkest parts of the human condition. If I'm honest, the news that there's so much blood in Webster's Titus Andronicus that they need a drain on stage has got me nervous of watching the show, rather than gleefully ready to excise my inner demons. Is he worried that this Titus might be so powerful – so bloody, and so upsetting – that people will faint? He is not. It's important you provide a content warning, and then people can make an informed decision about if they want to see it, says Webster. If people faint, they faint.

    "content": "Sister Midnight, Santosh and All We Imagine as Light are part of a new wave of female-centred Indian films challenging the roles of traditional Bollywood heroines. They're unpredictable, sometimes humorous, sometimes sexually adventurous, and they're all leading characters, rather than orbiting a man. The heroines of films including Sister Midnight, Santosh, Girls Will Be Girls, All We Imagine as Light and Shadowbox are giving international audiences a chance to see female characters from India who differ from most traditional Bollywood heroines. But do Indian audiences want to watch them – or will they even be able to? A feral bride in an arranged marriage that neither she nor the groom particularly want, Uma is the protagonist of Karan Kandhari's spiky comedy Sister Midnight, which premiered at the 2024Cannes Film Festivaland was nominated for a Bafta. Well-known Bollywood actress Radhika Apte, who plays her, is shown struggling with household chores. Men are dim, her neighbour tells her. They'll eat anything. Just add chilli and salt. Uma informs her awkward groom, who has gone on a week-long drinking binge, that he stinks and tells her employers sarcastically when they offer her a cleaning job that she's a domestic goddess. Told through offbeat dialogue, physical comedy and a punkish soundtrack that includes Iggy Pop, Sister Midnight presents a heroine unlike anything else filmed in India, according to Apte. I'd never read anything like it before and I couldn't put it down, she tells the BBC. I was completely taken by Uma, she was this crazy creature, and I didn't know why I resonated with her, but I just did. It was going to be a very thin line playing her between it being really cool and it going wrong. And that excited and challenged me. I also like how unapologetic Uma is and the more she accepts herself, the freer and stronger she becomes. Uma is the latest character that offers a different kind of female protagonist to Indian viewers, one who differs markedly from the traditional Bollywood heroine. Bollywood, the name for Hindi-language studio cinema, has historicallydominated the Indian box office, making around$1.36bn last year. But it's also been accused of beingsexist and regressivein its attitude towards women. In 2023,a landmark study in Indiaexamined some of the country's biggest hits in terms of gender representation and sexual stereotyping, and found what they described as a formula to many of Bollywood's female characters. The female lead has to be thin and beautiful. She has to be coy and demure who expresses consent through gestures rather than words, but [she] wears sexually revealing clothing and has to be somewhat modern to allow for her to be in a pre-marital relationship which is a transgression, Professor Lakshmi Lingam, the project lead for the study,told the BBCat the time. There's very little attempt to do something different. The depiction of both male and female characters on screen is important, she added, because in India, where families and schools rarely teach about sex education and consent, all our responses are influenced by books and cinema. By contrast, the male stars of thebiggest Bollywood filmsof 2023were described asled by alpha male protagonists with rippling muscles and blazing guns brandished on screen as they went on a bone-crunching rampage to vanquish their enemies. The hit films included Shah Rukh Khan's Pathaan and Jawan, in which he plays a spy and vigilante, as well as the much-criticised, hyper-violent Animal, starring Ranbir Kapoor, a filmaccused of misogyny and objectifying women.It was made by Sandeep Reddy Vanga, whose previous film Kabir Singh showed the male leadopenly stalking and harassing a womanand was the second biggest Bollywood movie of 2019. There have been hit films showing women in roles of authority, including female rocket scientists in Mission Mangal, also one of the most successful Bollywood films of 2019, and filmspraised for a modern perspective on gender roles, such as Karan Johar's Rocky aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani (Rocky and Rani's Love Story). But neverthelessShubhra Gupta, the film critic for daily newspaper The Indian Express, laments the lack of wriggle room India's leading ladies generally have in their roles. These heroines' overriding principle is demureness, she tells the BBC. You can have flashes of spirit, or you may speak your mind, but you'd also be just right in terms of beauty, and you'd be very clearly subservient to the leading man and whatever he is doing. You are pretty much always bringing up the rear, with a few scenes in which you get to shine. In Sandhya Suri's recent drama Santosh, however, a Dalit woman (from the lowest caste in Indian society) is as a police officer, with the authority that brings. Santosh inherits her husband's police officer job when he dies in service, something that's possible on compassionate grounds for government employees in India. Santosh, played by Shahana Goswami, is an enigmatic character who finds corruption in her local police force when a young girl is raped and murdered. She has a female boss, played by film and TV actress Sunita Rajwar, who has learned to compromise to stay at the top. Suri, previously a documentary maker, says she was influenced in making it by the real-life gang rape and murder in 2012 of ayoung woman on a bus in Delhi, which made worldwide headlines and led to new lawsto safeguard women. (Despite that, sexual violence against women and girlsremains highin India, and a 2022 reportfound thatcruelty by a husband or his relatives remained the biggest crime against Indian women.) There were big protests at the time [of the rape and murder], and I saw the photo of a female cop being confronted by some very angry female protestors. I saw that image and I saw the expression on the cop's face, and it was so enigmatic that I was just very, very taken by it. It was so interesting. She was at both ends of power. There was the possibility of violence against her, but [it was] also possible for her to mete out violence as well with that uniform, Suri tells the BBC. I wanted to know if you took somebody like Santosh, shut up in the kitchen of her house, and you put her in that place, what's her response to that? she explains. I wanted to ask if there was a way to be a woman that's not about being a man, and not about being oppressed. Is there some other way in her society in which she can be, and that there may be a line she steps over? Santosh, which was made in Hindi, was the UK'sOscar entryfor best international film in 2025 – one attribute both Sister Midnight and Santosh share is that, though they were filmed in India, they're made byBritish Indian film-makers. Sister Midnight's makers hope to release it in India in 2025, but Suri tells the BBC that Santosh will almost certainly not get a cinema release there. We screened it at the Mumbai International Film Festival and had a great response, and I was moved by just how real the film felt to a local audience, she says. But it looks like the film won't release in India, sadly, as it was admitted to the censor board (CBFC) and there were so many cuts, I couldn't maintain some semblance of a film. Indian censorship decisions have frequently caused controversy: in 2017, thedecision to banthe feminist Indian movie Lipstick Under My Burkha for being too lady oriented caused an outcry, and was lateroverturnedafter negative publicity. But many homegrown blockbusters are self-censoring, especially when it comes to sex and sexuality. The 2021 Telugu-language hit Pushpa: The Rise, the story of a smuggler,removed a scenewhere the hero Pushpa (played by Allu Arjun) touches the chest of the heroine, Srivalli, because of complaints from the audience. In 2024, Pushpa 2: The Rule again caused controversy in India, according to Shubhra Gupta, because of an insinuation that Srivalli (played by Rashmika Mandanna) might want to be sexually intimate with her husband. The [female] character acts very cute, she comes on to the hero and is very playful when she wants a little assignation, Gupta says of it. The rest of the film she's serving the hero. She wants her husband not to have sex with anyone else. But in fact, it became a real talking point in India because it's not something heroes or leading ladies in the movies are supposed to have conversations about. And our mainstream film experience is still very much that if a woman has a sexual experience outside marriage, there will be some castigation attached to it, she adds. She won't be 'pure' anymore, she'll be known as 'bold' which means she's been around. It makes Payal Kapadia'sacclaimed filmAll We Imagine as Light seem more audacious in terms of its exploration of sex. The first ever Indian winner of the Cannes Film Festival's Grand Prix is the story of a nurse, Prabha, who's been abandoned in her arranged marriage. Meanwhile, her younger flatmate Anu, a Hindu, wants to get intimate with her Muslim boyfriend,itself another taboo. There's no talk of marriage in advance. The film's about the preoccupations I've had for some time, Kapadia tells the BBC. Women in India can be financially independent, but there is still not a lot of autonomy with what you choose to do with your personal life. It's infantilising women. You could be 25 years old, making your own money, providing for your family back home. But you can't decide who to be with or who to marry. Despite the accolades, All We Imagine as Light was not chosen as India's 2025 Oscar entry (the deciding jury called it a European filmtaking placein India.) But it wasn't the only film by an Indian female director in 2024 that put a young woman's sexual awakening on screen – the English and Hindi language movie Girls Will Be Girls, by Shuchi Talati, won the audience award at the Sundance Film Festival. Set in a boarding school in the Himalayas, it's the story of an 18-year-old girl who falls in love with a boy for the first time, but whose romance is disrupted by her mother. But Indian films breaking societal norms have found international recognition before, from Mira Nair'sMonsoon Wedding(2001), to Lipstick Under My Burkha (2016), and 2014's LGBTQ+ teenage love story, Margarita with a Straw. Shubhra Gupta says there's still a vast gap between what an international audience react to and what mainstream Indian audiences will pay to see,given the high ticket prices in cinemas. These films we're talking about are part of independent Indian film, which is really where all the exciting things happen, and that's pretty much true of all world cinema, she says. Payal Kapadia has had a fabulous journey with All We Imagine as Light, and it did get a cinema release here. But I'm not sure how much box office it made in India. She adds that many viewers in India would react in disbelief to heroines such as Sister Midnight's Uma and Santosh were they able to watch the movies, as they are so unconventional. They wouldn't be able to suspend disbelief that in Santosh, a Dalit woman from the lower caste, would be made into the lead, that she's driving the narrative. It would be such a hard sell here, she says. And Radhika Apte's character Uma is a wife, but she is not submissive. She goes out there and does all these mad things. They are excellent films that might do well on a streaming platform, or they will find a discerning audience – but a discerning audience doesn't really make up the numbers that a big budget Bollywood film will. But Indian film-makers still have to try to break stereotypes for audiences, according to Tanushree Das and Saumyananda Sahi, the directors behind Bengali-language filmShadowbox. The film, shown at this year'sBerlin International Film Festival, is the story of Maya, (played by Tillotama Shome) who holds down several jobs and battles to keep her family going because her husband, a former soldier, struggles with his mental health and is frequently humiliated by the community because of it. When we're talking about working class underprivileged women, the term 'from the margins' tends to crop up, Das tells the BBC. But the 'margin' represents a huge majority of our population. Where are their stories, then? It's high time we broke stereotypes, and to do this more women need to tell their own stories. I feel producers and distributors of film underestimate how large a viewership women represent, and their appetite to see stories where their lives are mirrored rather than projected in a tokenistic way. If cinema itself is not an option, the rise of the international streamers and OTT platforms (which allow viewers to watch content directly on their TV or through a phone app) during the Covid-19 pandemic has provided a place for recent, more audacious, female-focused film-making. The Great Indian Kitchen in 2021 by Jeo Baby, a Malayalam language film, became a hit on the app Neestream, and versions of the story were also made in Tamil and Hindi. It's the story of an arranged marriage, and the film shows, from a female viewpoint, household drudgery, unpleasant in-laws and monotonous and painful sex with an uncaring husband, with one female criticsaying of itthat the film rips through patriarchy, the bedrock of the institutions of family and religion. Laapataa Ladies, by Kiran Rao (which did become India's Oscar entry this year) also deals with an unwanted arranged marriage and was released on Netflix, as was 2020'sGunjan Saxena, which told the story of India's first ever female fighter pilot. But people are not actually buying a ticket for these, Gupta says. It's mostly 15-to 35-year-olds who are going to the movies, andoften they happen to be young men. And the film industry is still a boy's club to a large extent. For more nuanced female characters to be seen in big-budget cinema films, ultimately Bollywood's lack of profits last year might be an impetus. After its bumper 2023, last year Bollywood only achieved40% of the overall Indian box office profits, and Gupta says its formulaic films are part of the problem. People are hungry for something different, she says. But the problem is, if you take them too far out of their comfort zone, I'm not sure whether they're going to come to the cinema. So unfortunately, we've ended up maintaining this equilibrium so that people will come to the movies not expecting to see women who are feminists, or women who do not ascribe to the idea of what a good woman should be. However, she adds, it's not just female characters who have to be written differently in order for change to come. I would say that if you want your women characters to be different, you also have to write your men differently too, says Gupta. There needs to be a cosmic shift across the board. Santosh and Sister Midnight are currently on release in the UK. Sister Midnight will be released in the US on 16 May 2025. -- If you liked this storysign up for The Essential List newsletter, a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

    "section": "culture",
    "content": "In April 1983, a German magazine, Stern, and a British newspaper, The Sunday Times, claimed to have made one of the century's most extraordinary historical discoveries. In fact, it was one of the century's most extraordinary hoaxes – and the scandal that followed cost millions and ruined reputations. On 25 April 1983, 42 years ago this week, respected German magazine Stern published what they believed to be the most spectacular historical scoop: the previously unknown private diaries of Adolf Hitler. To show off their extraordinary exclusive to the world's press, the weekly news magazine had arranged a Hamburg press conference for the same day. The story would indeed dominate global headlines – but not in the way the magazine hoped. Three days earlier, Stern's London editor Peter Wickman had told BBC News that they were absolutely convinced that they had the authentic Hitler diaries in their hands. We were very dubious at the beginning, but we had a graphologist looking at them, we had an expert who compared the paper. We had historians like Professor Trevor-Roper, and they are all convinced they are genuine. The handwritten journals ran from 1932 to 1945, covering the entire period of Hitler's Third Reich. There are 60 diaries, they look a bit like school exercise books but with a hard cover. They have seals outside with a swastika and an eagle and inside, of course, Hitler's very spidery gothic handwriting, Wickman told the BBC. Stern believed that their discovery had the potential to rewrite what was previously known about the Nazi leader. And the diaries' content was certainly eye-opening, revealing a little-known sensitive side to the Führer. They detailed everything from Hitler's battles with flatulence and halitosis, and the pressure from his girlfriend Eva Braun to get Olympics tickets, to notes about sending Stalin – the old fox – a birthday telegram. The notebooks also seemed to indicate, somewhat startlingly, that the Nazi leader was unaware of the Holocaust that was being carried out in his name. The journals had supposedly been unearthed by Stern journalistGerd Heidemann. The reporter was already regarded around Stern as something of a Nazi memorabilia obsessive. In 1973, the magazine had assigned him to write a story about a dilapidated yacht which had once belonged to Hitler's second-in-command, Hermann Göring. Heidemann spent a fortune buying the yacht and restoring it. He also began an affair with Göring's daughter Edda, who introduced him to a number of former Nazis. It was through these contacts, Heidemann said, that he had come across Hitler's diaries. Heidemann claimed that the plane had been carrying the diaries, which were salvaged from the crash and stowed away in a hayloft. In the intervening years, they had found their way to an East German collector who was now offering to sell them. The reporter would negotiate the deal to buy them, acting as intermediary between his East German source and Stern. The promise of a sensational world exclusive, providing previously unknown insight into the mind of the Nazi dictator, proved irresistible to the magazine. But Stern was determined to keep a tight grip on who knew about their scoop, so when they hiredhandwriting expertsto authenticate the diaries – providing them with genuine Hitler documents for comparison – they would only give them a few selected pages of the notebooks to look at. Stern ultimately forked out some 9.3 million Deutschmarks (£2.3m) for the volumes, and, having paid such an exorbitant sum, opted to store them in a Swiss vault for safekeeping. The first historian to examine the diaries was Prof Hugh Trevor-Roper, also known as Lord Dacre of Glanton. In 1947, he had written a book, The Last Days of Hitler, which had brought him a great deal of academic prestige, and he was regarded as a leading expert on the Nazi dictator. He was also an independent director of The Times newspaper, which two years earlier had been acquired along with its sister paper, The Sunday Times, byRupert Murdoch. Lord Dacre was initially sceptical about the diaries, but flew to Switzerland to view them. His opinion began to be swayed when he heard the diaries' origin story and was told, erroneously, that chemical tests had found them to be pre-war. But what really tipped the balance for the historian was seeing the huge volume of material involved. The thing that struck Hugh Trevor-Roper most forcefully and certainly struck me as a non-expert when I saw the original material was the sheer scale of it, The Times editor Charles Douglas-Home told the BBC on 22 April 1983. The enormous range of this archive. It's not just that there are nearly 60 volumes of notebooks filled out in Hitler's longhand which is there, there are about 300 of his drawings and pictures and personal documents such as his party card. I remember there are the drawings which he submitted to art school when he was a young man hoping to get into art school, and there is a painting, an oil painting and so on. Now a forger would have to be very good to forge across that whole range. Lord Dacre became convinced that the journals were genuine, even writing an article for The Times vouching for their authenticity and declaring that historic events might need to be re-evaluated in light of them. As word got out about the Hitler diaries, a bidding war developed over their serialisation rights, with The Sunday Times proprietor, Murdoch, flying over to Zurich to negotiate a deal in person. With serialisation deals signed, Stern hastily planned a press conference to announce the publication of Hitler's diaries to the world. But even before the notebooks' grand reveal, doubts were being raised about their veracity – not least by the staff of The Sunday Times themselves, who had been burnt before. In 1968, the newspaper had made a down payment on diaries supposedly written by the Italian fascist leaderBenito Mussolini, which had also been vouched for, by his son no less. But they turned out to be fakes devised by two little old ladies who lived in Vercelli outside Milan, journalist Phillip Knightley, who worked for The Sunday Times's investigative team, toldWitness Historyin 2011. However, Murdoch was certain about the diaries and, despite the reservations of its editor, Frank Giles, rushed the serialisation into print in The Sunday Times with the headline world exclusive the day before Stern's press announcement. Giles rang Lord Dacre seeking reassurance about the story only to have the historian confess that he was not so much having doubts as making a 180-degree turn regarding the diaries' authenticity. Everybody in the room, all the newspaper executives slumped down in their chairs and put their heads in their hands because we had lost our principal authenticator, said Knightley. It was clear that the story was absolutely wrong. The Sunday Times could still have stopped the presses and changed the front page. But when Giles rang the proprietor, Murdoch said, 'Just because Dacre has been vacillating for all this time, screw him, we'll publish,' recalls Knightley. For Stern, things would just get worse at itsnews conferencethe next day. After editor-in-chief Peter Koch declared that he was 100% convinced that Hitler wrote every single word in those books, Lord Dacre, the very historian who had vouched they were the real deal, admitted under questioning that he was having second thoughts. To the horrified looks of the Stern executives, Lord Dacre said that he wasn't able to establish a link between the plane crash and the alleged diaries and that he had been rushed into making a judgement. I must say as a historian, I regret that the normal methods of historical verification have, perhaps necessarily, been to some extent sacrificed to the requirements of the journalistic scoop, he said. More like this: •The true story of The Great Escape •The British politician who faked his own death •How Oskar Schindler saved 1,200 Jewish people in WW2 The day after the chaotic press conference, Charles Hamilton, a US autographs dealer, told BBC Breakfast that as soon he saw the diaries' pages he could smell the ebullient odour of forgeries. Hamilton said that he knew the signature wasn't authentic because he was constantly offered fake Hitler documents. Shortly it will be established without any question, and without any panel of experts which I think is superfluous at the present time, the whole affair will die down and it will be a great hoax in the history of mankind, he said. And he was not wrong. Within two weeks, rigorous forensic analysis had exposed the diaries as fakes. Not only, as Hamilton had pointed out to the BBC, was Hitler's supposed signature not accurate, but chemical testing revealed that their paper, glue and ink were not manufactured until after World War Two. The diaries were peppered with errors, modern-day phrases and historical inaccuracies, sometimes referring to information that Hitler could not have possibly known. In the wake of these revelations The Sunday Times quickly abandoned its serialisation and printed an apology. Stern also publicly apologised for having fallen for the hoax. Under pressure, Heidemann revealed that the East German source supplying the diaries wasKonrad Kujau– a counterfeiter who turned out to be the author of the works. Kujau was a skilled artist, but his forgeries were far from sophisticated. Seeking inspiration, he had plagiarised large parts of Max Domarus's book Hitler: Speeches and Proclamations 1932-1945, and as a result had copied word for word some of the chronological and factual mistakes in that book's first edition. To try to give the journals a more personal feel, he had imagined a more prosaic side to the Führer's life, throwing in entries like I can't even get off work and visit Eva, Have to go to the post office, to send a few telegrams, and Eva says I have bad breath. Kujau had even struggled with the elaborate Gothic initials he used on the diary covers, accidentally sticking the initials FH to them instead of AH. He had then attempted to age the notebooks by merely pouring tea over them and bashing them on his desk. What helped with the initial authentication of the diaries was that Kujau was such a prolific forger of Nazi memorabilia that many of the genuine documents Stern had given to experts, to enable them to compare Hitler's handwriting, had actually also been produced by Kujau himself. He was arrested by the police and admitted to his role in the hoax. He even went so far as to demonstrate his guilt by writing his confession in the style of Hitler's handwriting. In 1985, he was found guilty of fraud and forgery and sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison. On further investigation, the police found Heidemann had also inflated the prices he said his source was requesting for the diaries, and had been skimming money off the top of the sums paid by Stern. He seems to have done this to fund his lavish lifestyle, the upkeep of his Nazi yacht and his penchant for buying ever more dictators' memorabilia (he would later claim to possess Idi Amin's underwear). He, like Kujau, was convicted in 1985 of fraud and was sentenced to four years, eight months. At his trial, Heidemann maintained that he too had been duped, but Kujau always insisted that the reporter knew the diaries were fakes. In the fallout from the scandal,Lord Dacre's reputationas a historian would be permanently tarnished. Koch and another of Stern's editors would lose their jobs, while Giles would be removed from his role as The Sunday Times editor. Even Murdoch would later claim tothe Leveson Inquiryinto media ethics in 2012 that his decision to run with the story was a major mistake I made, I take full responsibility for it. I will have to live with it for the rest of my life. However, his newspaper's circulation was boosted by his decision to print the false story. And since Murdoch had insisted on a clause that Stern return all the money paid to it by The Sunday Times if the diaries were shown to be fake, the media mogul would only profit financially from the hoax. -- For more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to theIn History newsletter, whileThe Essential Listdelivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

    "section": "culture",
    "content": "It may be set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, but Tony Gilroy's Star Wars series takes a key plot from a real robbery masterminded by Stalin in an Imperial Russian city. And Andor has as much to do with our world as it has with Stalin's. It has all the makings of the perfect heist. The scheme takes place far from the imperial seat of power, on the wild fringes of an empire almost too vast to comprehend. Fuelled with revolutionary zeal, the plotters are a rag-tag outfit of men and women that includes thieves, murderers and turncoats. Their prize? A treasure chest of cash that can fund ever-more-ambitious missions against the hated ruling elite. If you watched the first season of the Star Wars spin-off TV seriesAndor,you'll recognise this plot as one of the high points. Over three episodes, anti-hero Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and his band of accomplices hide out in mountain passes on the planet Aldhani, fine-tuning an audacious smash-and-grab from an Imperial garrison which is storing the wages of an entire sector. The real-life theft that inspired it was also a long, long time ago, just not quite so far away. It took place in Yerevan Square in what was then the imperial Russian city of Tiflis, now the Georgian capital Tblisi, on 26 June 1907. A shipment of cash for the city's Russian state bank branch, amounting to some 300,000 roubles ($1m at the time), was stolen by a gang of robbers linked to the Bolshevik revolutionary movement. Using bombs and guns, the gang left a scene of utter devastation in their wake; some 40 people were killed and dozens more injured. The news of the brazen daylight attack made headlines across the world. The heist was the brainchild of a charismatic cobbler's son-turned-revolutionary called Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili. He was a gifted public speaker, an ex-seminary student, a romantic poet rumoured to have left a string of broken hearts in his rakish wake. He often went by the name Soso (which he had used when writing poems for local publications), though in years to come he would become far better-known – and feared – as Joseph Stalin. Yes, the troubled outlaw beloved by Star Wars fans everywhere is based in part on one of history’s most notorious mass murderers, as the series' creator, Tony Gilroy, has acknowledged. If you look at a picture of young Stalin, isn’t he glamorous, Gilroy said in an interview inRolling Stone in 2022.He looks like Diego! Stalin took Russia from its war-ravaged imperial decline to a nuclear-armed superpower in just three decades, but also presided over a reign of authoritarian terror that starved, executed or imprisoned millions of its own citizens. Countless books had been written on his cruel years in power, but very little on his early years. Writer Simon Sebag Montefiore saw a gap, and began rifling through archives in post-Soviet countries to try and separate the truth from myth, and tell the little-known story of Stalin's early life. In 2007 – a century after the infamous heist in Tiflis –Young Stalinwas published. It delved into the early life of the Soviet Union's dictatorial leader. Should the life of a black-hearted ogre, a mass murderer who was the wickedest of the 20th-Century's monsters, be quite so entertaining,asked a review in The Observer at the time. One person who read Young Stalin was Gilroy. The writer and producer, who had scripted the first four Bourne films and the Andor-precursor film,Rogue One, was planning a TV series that would explore Cassian Andor's journey from casual thief to rebellious figurehead. The true story of a revolutionary movement on the far fringes of a real empire gave Gilroy his source material. Literally, I’m the classic old white guy who just can’t get enough history, Gilroy said in Rolling Stone. The last 15 years, I’ve been reading all non-fiction. He added that Young Stalin was an amazing book and that its account of the Tiflis bank robbery was an incredible movie sequence. Did Sebag Montefiore ever think to himself, 'Here's the perfect setting for a Star Wars spin-off,' when he was researching his book? No, I didn't ever think that when I was toiling in the archives in Moscow and Tbilisi, he tells the BBC. But I did think that there was something pretty elemental about the life of Stalin, especially before 1917. It was a fascinating story, partly because no one knew about it. The Tiflis heist was reported around the world and funded the revolutionaries' movement for years, says Sebag Montefiore. Lenin and the whole Bolshevik Party lived off that money until the [1917] revolution. Sebag Montefiore says that the young Stalin and the troubled Andor bear striking similarities: A young man from nowhere with a revolutionary ideology, and a fight against a huge empire, the writer says. I did think there was something interesting about the secret life of someone in that situation. That's basically what Tony Gilroy has focused on in Andor. Stalin was, of course, not the only figure fomenting turmoil in Tsarist Russia, and Andor fleshes out other characters with attributes from the young Georgian's contemporaries. Among Andor's co-conspirators in the Aldanhi heist is Karis Nemik (Alex Lawther), an idealist writing a high-minded manifesto for the emerging resistance, similar to Bolshevik Leon Trotsky's polemics amid the opulent decline of Romanov rule. Stellan Skarsgård's character, Luthen Rael, is an analogue for Vladimir Lenin, the Bolshevik leader who was able to form a powerful movement from unlikely bedfellows. A wealthy art collector, Luthen's precise manners in front of his gilded customers hide an uncompromising hatred of the empire and a restless desire to fund a growing resistance. In Cassian's talented, taciturn thief he sees a useful tool; Lenin saw the same in Stalin. In 1911, people said to Lenin, 'Why are you using this guy? He's a gangster. He's had people killed. He was involved in all these bank robberies,' says Sebag Montefiore. And Lenin replies, 'He's exactly the type we need.' Stalin could edit a paper. He could write and could read. And he was also someone who could arrange a hit on somebody and arrange a bank robbery. That was what Lenin talked about: some people were tea drinkers, and other people were thugs, Stalin could do both, and that's why Stalin won in the end. The research into historical rebellions – Gilroy has said he studied other revolutions while writing Andor, as well – has no doubt helped create the show's oddly realistic feel. Andor feels more down to earth than anything the Star Wars universe has shown us before, if you'll excuse the occasional spaceship roaring overhead, or an alien or two sitting in the local bar. There are flashes of mundane detail rarely scene in big-budget sci-fi. People complain that Andor's mother Maarva's (Fiona Shaw) house is always too cold. Security officer Syril Karn's (Kyle Soller) petulant intensity even extends to tailoring his uniform to make him look smarter than his contemporaries. The Imperial Security Bureau hoping to root out the emerging rebellion is a nest of competing ambitions that feels as real as anything in a historical drama – or in everyday office politik. There are fewer blaster-toting Stormtroopers than there are in the Star Wars films, and more sadistic, trenchcoated officers who would have been right at home in the Tsarist secret police, the Okhrana, or its Soviet replacement, the Cheka. In the past, Star Wars movies drop us in at a very big moment, says Walter Marsh, an Australian writer whopraised Andor's grown-up worldview in The Guardian in 2022. There's the big climactic battle, or Luke Skywalker's heroic journey, and they're these big themes of good versus evil. But as any historian will tell you, wars and empires and revolutions don't start and end overnight, and there's always this bigger backstory. There's this sort of long tail. It takes years for that kind of colonial rot, those systems of control, to set in. More like this: •The Japanese film that Star Wars stole from •The truth about Henry VIII's right-hand man •Black Mirror's most 'devastating' episode ever Andor shows the corruption and brutal entitlement found at every layer of autocratic regimes: the guards drinking in a brothel while they're supposed to be on duty (and prepared to shake down anyone they don't like the look of); the prison industrial system that requires constant additions even if the new prisoners have done nothing wrong; the subtle sabotage of ethnic pilgrimages to sacred land that is earmarked for imperial development. And withauthoritarianism on the risearound the globe, Andor has as much to say about today's world as it does about Stalin's. When the show came out I think I was pleasantly surprised to see a story in that universe that was familiar, but which also approached this question of empire that's been so central to the whole franchise, but was never actually tackled in a really nuanced and human character-driven way, Marsh tells the BBC. It's all well and good to have a big, evil Sith Lord achieve global, universal domination. But how does power assert itself on the street level, from one human to another? The Empire is this huge grinding, unthinking machine, but it's also a very human thing, Marsh continues. Who are the people that find a place and thrive in those systems? He remarks that in the original films the Imperials were little more than blank-and-you-miss-them pantomime villains: British guys in suits getting choked by Darth Vader at some point, who are just fiddling with buttons in the background. Andor's strength is its three-episode arcs that showed us the kind of death by a thousand cuts that it takes to achieve this sort of social, political and economic dominance, says Marsh. The converse of that is it shows all the ways in which that kind of oppression inspires pushback and resistance in all kinds of different ways. The new season, which begins on Tuesday 22 April, will develop the rebellion's story as it rushes towards the events seen in Rogue One: the scenes of brutal Imperial reactions to a demonstration shown in the trailer evoke the Tsarist crackdown on a St Petersburg march in 1905, which was a  slow-burning contributor to the Bolshevik revolution. The scavenger who becomes a passionate revolutionary leader is kind of fascinating, says Sebag Montefiore of the troubled Cassian Andor. That's a great trajectory, because that's exactly what Stalin did. And it'll be interesting to see how deep Gilroy uses that – how far he goes to create a character with both heroic and villainous features. George Lucas's original film trilogy rooted the rebellion in the classic good-guys-versus-bad-guys dynamic of countless Saturday matinee cliffhangers, the resistance modelled after anti-Nazi opposition in occupied Europe. The rebels of Andor inhabit a much more compromised reality; like real-life revolutionary movements, they are much more complicated than the ones we usually see on screen. Luthen, Andor's Lenin proxy, considers it with chilling deliberation in one of the first season's standout scenes: I'm condemned to use the tools of my enemy to defeat them. I burn my decency for someone else's future. I burn my life to make a sunrise that I know I’ll never see. As Sebag Montefiore notes, the revolutionaries themselves knew deep down that if they took power, they themselves would have to use repression as a tool; they would become what they once despised. Lenin himself said: 'A revolution without firing squads is meaningless.' Andor season two is available on Disney+ from 22 April. -- If you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

    "title": "Why this iconic 1839 painting is not what it seems",
    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250415-jmw-turner-at-250-why-his-greatest-painting-the-fighting-temeraire-is-so-misunderstood",
    "section": "culture",
    "content": "As museums around the world celebrate the 250th birthday of JMW Turner, it's time to reappraise his beloved and celebrated painting, The Fighting Temeraire. JMW Turner's The Fighting Temeraire became a national celebrity when it was first unveiled in 1839, and its fame has endured to the present day. It was once votedBritain's favourite paintingand currently features on£20 banknotes. But the widely accepted interpretation of this iconic painting's message might, in fact, contradict Turner's true intentions. The Temeraire of the title refers to a 98-gun warship of the British Navy, which is depicted in the painting's background. It was a hero in Britain's defence against France during the Napoleonic Wars, but it caught the nation's attention in 1838 when it was dismantled and its parts sold off. Turner's painting depicts this once-mighty gladiator of the seas being towed down a burnished River Thames by a much more recently invented steam-powered tugboat. A brief segment in the 2012 James Bond filmSkyfallcaptures a popular view about the painting. In the scene, Bond (Daniel Craig) meets Q (Ben Whishaw), his new head of research and development, in London's National Gallery, and they sit in front of The Fighting Temeraire. It always makes me feel a little melancholy, says the young, tech-savvy Q, in a pointed jibe to 007, an old-school field agent. A grand old warship being ignominiously hauled away for scrap. This echoes the widely held belief that the painting evokes a sense of nostalgia and faded national glory. According to this view, the ghostly Temeraire is the painting's heroine, and the tugboat its villain. In the 19th Century, the English writer William Makepeace Thackeray referred to the smaller vessel as a little, spiteful, diabolical steamer and the American novelist Herman Melville called it a pygmy steam-tug by comparison to the Titan Temeraire. You can see why Turner's original audience may have sympathised with the humbled HMS Temeraire and been saddened by her fate. Back in 1804, she had played a critical role in blockading French ports and defending the British coast. But her finest moment came on the afternoon of 21 October 1805, in the Atlantic Ocean, just off the coast of south-west Spain. At this pivotal hour, the Battle of Trafalgar, a deadly sea battle between the British Royal Navy and the combined fleets of Spain and France, was at its climax. Admiral Lord Nelson's flagship HMS Victory had led the attack but was being pummelled by the French vessel Redoubtable. Then, out of the cannon smoke, surged HMS Temeraire, followed by a war-hungry flotilla of British vessels. The Temeraire blasted the Redoubtable with her guns and endured a hailstorm of cannon volleys in return – an onslaught that lacerated the ship and spattered her decks with blood. But like a stalwart prize-fighter, the Temeraire weathered the bout. She valiantly protected her flagship and played a vital part in the British navy's ultimate victory in the Battle of Trafalgar. Turner was 64 when he painted The Fighting Temeraire. He was born in 1775 in a down-at-heel area of London near Covent Garden but managed to enrol at the prestigious Royal Academy of Arts aged 14. He became an Academician at the precocious age of 24, and a Professor of Perspective when he was just 32. But although he rubbed shoulders with the great and the good, he refused to soften his Cockney accent or refine his manners. He was also fiercely entrepreneurial – he opened his own private gallery, sought wealthy patrons, and was always on the lookout for captivating and lucrative new artistic projects that might have widespread appeal. On one level, The Fighting Temeraire achieves his desire for broad popularity by harnessing people's sense of national pride. But there's an even more important message to learn from the painting than its patriotism and sentimentality. It concerns that much maligned tugboat: the true focal point of the painting. Steam power was the new mechanical wonder of Turner's age, and his attitude to this recent technology was much more complicated than Thackeray, Melville or Q recognised. In other Turner artworks, like Snow Storm – Steam-Boat (1842) and Rain, Steam and Speed (1844), you can see his fascination with modern machinery and its transformative influence on individual experience, the environment, and society as a whole. This is in stark contrast with Turner's great rival John Constable, whose parents were from the elite, and whose paintings tended to overlooksome of the most seismic changesthat were reshaping the British Isles at the time. In Constable's iconic 1821 painting The Hay Wain, an archaic cart rolls gently away from the viewer into a bucolic English landscape. Turner's The Fighting Temeraire gives us the exact opposite, putting the spectator on a collision course with the unstoppable force of industry. This reflected contemporary reality. At the time The Fighting Temeraire was painted, the Royal Navy was increasingly using steamboats for towing bigger vessels. Moves were already afoot to replace its sail-powered fleet with new steam frigates. But the demise of the Temeraire didn't reflect a routine upgrade in armaments. This was a one-of-a-kind revolution in seafaring. Sailors around the world had relied on wind-and-sail or oar-propulsion for thousands of years. Now, steam engines could allow seafarers to overcome the vagaries of gusts, shallows and tidal patterns – to supersede nature itself. The future was steam-powered, but how this was going to affect the future of transport, trade and naval combat was still anybody's guess in the 1830s. What Turner did know was that as far back asHomer's Odyssey, sailing functioned as a profound symbol of the life journey in art and literature. And so, by hitching the old and the new so unforgettably in his painting, he shows us a compelling metamorphosis – the beginning of a new, post-industrial lifecycle in human history. Turner was awake to the responsibility of artists in times of irreversible historical change. For him, the age-old skill of depicting wooden sailing ships, their rigging, sails and ornately carved figureheads was becoming obsolete. The challenge for every artist (and every member of society) in the modern age, he realised, was to discover beauty and significance in newness, and in artefacts that had not previously been depicted in art, like iron funnels, pistons, valves, and paddle wheels. In The Fighting Temeraire, his rise to this challenge is captured in a very memorable and uncompromising symbol. More like this: •The forgotten Monet finally getting her moment •The schmaltzy paintings that divided the US •The surprising story of Van Gogh's guardian angel Turner even adapted his painting technique to express the technological and social transformations in the world around him. He used newly invented paint hues like Lemon Yellow and Scarlet Lake in The Fighting Temeraire. Pigment analysis of the painting also indicates that he raided from his kitchen for substances to add his paint to achieve desired effects, like tallow, cooking fat or even salad oil. His interest in new technology, and his search for innovative techniques with which to represent them, had a direct impact on the next generation of avant-garde painters. Claude Monet and Camille Pissarro were both wowed by Turner's art. An engraving of Turner's Rain, Steam and Speed (which depicts a train hurtling over Maidenhead bridge) was even displayed atthe first Impressionist Exhibition in Paris in 1874– a pivotal event in the history of modern art. In 2025 various exhibitions will celebrate the 250th anniversary of Turner's birth, from Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool (Turner: Always Contemporary), to Turner's House in Twickenham (Turner's Kingdom: Beauty, Birds and Beasts), and from the Yale Centre for British Art, Connecticut (JMW Turner: Romance and Reality) to Tate Britain (Turner and Constable). But to fully appreciate this extraordinary artist, it's important to grasp the true meaning of his masterpiece, The Fighting Temeraire. Frequently it's been accepted as a melancholy image, a forlorn lament for past glories and a lost way of life. But this misses its essential point. The Fighting Temeraire is really about transformation and the inevitability of change rather than nostalgia. The most important lessons to learn from The Fighting Temeraire are about Turner's attitude and outlook. It embodies his refusal to be daunted by newness or enslaved by traditional artistic values. His quest to find the beauty and grandeur of modern experience, and leave the past behind, is magnificently on display in The Fighting Temeraire. And these qualities are truly his lasting legacy to modern art. The 250th anniversary of JMW Turner's birth is on 23 April 2025. -- If you liked this story,sign up for The Essential List newsletter– a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250410-the-men-behind-the-great-train-robbery",
    "section": "culture",
    "content": "Britain in the 1960s was captivated by the daring of the Great Train Robbery, and the sheer scale of the money stolen. But when the accused men stood trial in April 1964, the judge was determined to send a message that such crimes would not be tolerated. Fourteen years later, several of the convicts talked to the BBC. On 16 April 1964, Robert Welch was one of the 12 men found guilty of a notorious heist in Aylesbury Crown Court. Fourteen years later, in 1978, he was on the BBC's documentary and current affairs programme, Man Alive, and recalled seeing local dignitaries jostle for positions in the courtroom to hear the sentencing. This was what they had all come to watch. The climax of the play, the drama, Welch said. And the medieval setting in which we were sentenced, you know, it was a bit chilling. Welch and his fellow convicts had fallen a long way since pulling off one of the most audacious and lucrative thefts the UK had ever seen: the Great Train Robbery. Welch and his co-defendants were part of a band who held up a Royal Mail night train travelling from Glasgow to London. The robbers had made off with £2.6m in used banknotes, a record haul at that time, and the equivalent of over £50m ($65.8m) today. At the time of Welch's trial, police were still hunting for three of the people they suspected had been involved in the crime. To execute this carefully orchestrated robbery,15 membersof two of London's biggest criminal gangs had worked together, each tasked with a particular role in the plot. They were regarded as the elite of the criminal world, Reginald Abbiss, who had covered the crime for the BBC as a young reporter,told the Witness History podcastin 2023. You had to have a certain talent and audacity, certain abilities to be able to pull a heist of this magnitude and they came together because they needed a multitude of talent. Thedaring robberytook place just after 03:00 on 8 August 1963. The first step the criminals had taken was to cut the phone lines to stop an alarm being raised. They then rigged the train signals to stay red. They put a glove over the green light, they wired a cheap battery up to the red light and this, of course, meant the driver had to slow up, said Abbiss. Seeing the red light, the train's driver, Jack Mills, stopped the engine, and his co-driver, David Whitby, climbed out to use the trackside phone to find out what the problem was. That's when Whitby discovered that the line had been cut, and he was set upon by masked men wearing boiler suits. In the meantime, a masked robber burst into the train's cab to restrain the driver. When Mills tried to put up a fight, another gang member hit him over the head, rendering him semi-conscious. The one glitch, if you like, was the fact that the train driver… tried to resist, said Abbiss. One of the robbers hit him on the head with a cosh. A lot of blood and down he went. The gang had been given inside information that the cash and high-value packages were held in the train's front two coaches. And because it was a Bank Holiday weekend, it would be carrying more money than usual. Although there weren't any police onboard, there were more than 70 Post Office employees, mostly in the rear carriages, where they were busy sorting letters. The criminals who had already familiarised themselves with the train's operation and layout quickly uncoupled the two money-laden carriages. The plan was to detach them and drive them away from the steep embankment to a predetermined rendezvous where it would be easier to unload the bags of cash. It was then they hit a problem. They had a driver to drive the train, he couldn't get the train going, and they had to pull the original driver, Jack Mills, up from the floor and threaten him and say, 'Drive the train,' said Abbiss. He managed to get the train a mile up the line to where most of the gang were waiting, leaving the other eight or nine coaches with sorters happily sorting, totally unaware that the main part of the train had gone on ahead. Mills, still bleeding profusely, was told to stop the two front carriages at Bridego Bridge. There, the rest of the gang broke into the carriages, overpowering the Post Office staff working in them, and forcing them to lie face down on the floor. They also brought in Mills and Whitby, who were handcuffed together.  The gang had decided that they would give themselves just 15 minutes to unload the loot and then leave whatever money was left. They formed a human chain and swiftly removed 120 sacks containing two-and-a-half tonnes of money into parked Land Rovers. After a quarter of an hour, the crew called time and ordered the terrified Post Office staff to stay still and not to attempt to contact the police for 30 minutes. Then the robbersdrove off into the night. The boldness of the theft and the enormous sum of money involved captured the British public's imagination. In the weeks that followed, the country was gripped by sensational headlines detailing the police's hunt for the perpetrators. But despite the meticulous nature of the robbery's planning and its skilful execution, within a year the majority of the criminal gang had been rounded up and were facing trial. Well, at first view, the job was a very well-planned job, ex-Det Supt Malcolm Fewtrell, who led investigations into the heist, told BBC News in 1964. But in the event, it has been a disaster. They obviously weren't so clever as they thought they were. The judge at their trial did not view the robbers' actions in the romantic way some of the public seemed to,saying that it would be positively evilif he showed the convicted men any semblance of leniency. I remember a shock wave ran through the courtroom when the judge, a man called Lord Justice Edmund Davies, handed down 307 years in the space of half an hour, Abbiss told BBC Witness History in 2023. At the time, the punishments they received for the robbery were some of the harshest in British criminal history, especially since nobody had been killed and no firearms had been used. I was just numbed, I couldn't think of anything but 30 years. When are we going to get out? We are never going to get out, one of the robbers, Tommy Wisbey, told Man Alive in 1978. I don't think it really hits you until a couple of days later and you realise what you've got, fellow gang member Gordon Goody said to the BBC. I mean it was a bit of a joke downstairs, clowning around and all that kind of thing. But deep down, I suppose you were sick. More like this: •The British politician who was caught faking his own death •The true story of The Great Escape •The bizarre siege behind Stockholm Syndrome The reason the judge gave for the severity of the prison terms was the assault on Mills. Anybody who has seen that nerve-shattered engine driver can have no doubt of the terrifying effect on law-abiding citizens of a concerted assault by armed robbers, said Justice Davies at the trial. Mills never worked again and died in 1970 of leukaemia. His co-driver Whitby died of a heart attack the following year at the age of 34. But there was also a sense, at least among the robbers themselves, that they were being disproportionately punished because the heist had embarrassed the British establishment. One of them, Roy James, said to the BBC in 1978, At that moment, all the shame that was with me throughout the trial was lifted because I felt that Mr Edmund Davies then used his position as a High Court judge, used the backing of the state for vengeance. He put himself on a par with me and everything that he said I was. There was a feeling that Justice Davies came down particularly hard for two reasons, said Abbiss. One was the violence shown against the train driver, and the other was that the establishment, the government, the Post Office and British Rail, the way that they were sort of caught with their pants down. It showed the establishment to be people perhaps who take their eye off the ball. The criminals' notoriety only grew following their sentencing when two of the gang made dramatic escapes from prison. Charles Wilson, who had been the treasurer of the group, broke out of jail just four months after the trial. He was recaptured in Canada after four years on the run and served another 10 years behind bars.Ronnie Biggsescaped from London's Wandsworth Prison, 15 months after his sentencing, using a makeshift rope ladder. He underwent plastic surgery and lived at times in Spain, Australia and Brazil, evading arrest for nearly 40 years. In 2001, he voluntarily returned to the UK for medical treatment and served the rest of his prison sentence. The law would also eventually catch up with the three gang members who didn't stand trial that day. Bruce Reynolds, considered to be the robbery's mastermind, spent five years on the run until he was arrested on his return to England. He was sentenced to 25 years in jail, but ended up serving just 10. His son Nick, who spent his early life on the run with his father in Mexico and Canada, would later have his own link to the outlaw lifestyle when his band Alabama 3's song Woke Up This Morning became the opening theme of The Sopranos TV series. Ronald Buster Edwards, who was later played by Genesis singer Phil Collins in a 1988 film, Buster, fled to Mexico following the robbery. He gave himself up in 1966 and was released after serving nine years. James White, who acted as the quartermaster for the robbery, was caught in Kent and sent to prison after three years on the run. He was released in 1975. Despite the lengthy jail time handed down, all the men convicted of the Great Train Robbery would end up being released early. None served more than 13 years for the crime – although many of them would return to prison for different offences in the years that followed. As for the huge haul stolen during the robbery, despite the police in 1964 offering a 10% share for information that would lead them to it, the majority of the money was never recovered. -- For more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to theIn History newsletter, whileThe Essential Listdelivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

    "content": "In 1966, the remote Spanish village of Palomares found that the nuclear age had fallen on them from a clear blue sky. Two years after the terrifying accident, BBC reporter Chris Brasher went to find what happened when the US lost a hydrogen bomb. On 7 April 1966, almost 60 years ago this week, a missing nuclear weapon for which the US military had been desperately searching for 80 days was finally found. The warhead, with an explosive power 100 times that of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, was carefully winched from a depth of 2,850ft (869m) out of the Mediterranean Sea and delicately lowered onto the USS Petrel. Once it was on board, officers painstakingly cut into the thermonuclear device's casing to disarm it. It was only then that everyone could breathe a sigh of relief – the last of the four hydrogen bombs that the US had accidentally dropped on Spain had been recovered. This was not the first accident involving nuclear weapons, said BBC reporter Chris Brasher when he reported from the scene in 1968. The Pentagon lists at leastnine previous accidentsto aircraft carrying hydrogen bombs. But this was the first accident on foreign soil, the first to involve civilians and the first to excite the attention of the world. This terrifying situation had come about because of a US operation code-namedChrome Dome. At the beginning of the 1960s, the US had developed a project to deter its Cold War rival, the Soviet Union, from launching a pre-emptive strike. A patrol of nuclear-armed B-52 bombers would continuously criss-cross the skies, primed to attack Moscow at a moment's notice. But to stay airborne on these long looping routes, the planes needed to refuel while in flight. On 17 January 1966, one such bomber was flying at a height of 31,000ft (9.5km) over the Almería region of southern Spain, and attempted a routine air-to-air refuelling with a KC-135 tanker plane. I believe what happened was the bomber was closing at a too-high rate of closure speed and he didn't stabilise his position, US Maj Gen Delmar Wilson, the man in charge of dealing with the catastrophic accident, told Brasher, with the result that they got too close and collided. The B-52 bomber's impact with the refuelling plane tore it open, igniting the jet fuel the KC-135 was carrying and killing all four of the crew onboard. The ensuing explosion also killed two men in the B-52's tail section. A third managed to eject, but died when his parachute did not open. The other four members of the bomber's crew successfully bailed out of their burning plane before it broke apart and fell to earth, raining down both flaming aircraft fragments and its lethal thermonuclear cargo onto the remote Spanish village of Palomares. The huge fireball was seen a mile away. Thankfully, it did not trigger a nuclear explosion. The bomber's warheads were not armed and had built-in safeguards to prevent an unintended atomic chain reaction. But the thermonuclear devices did have explosives surrounding their plutonium cores as part of the triggering mechanism. In the event of an accident, the bombs had parachutes attached to them designed to cushion the impact on landing and prevent radioactive contamination. And indeed, one undetonated bomb did land safely in a riverbed and was recovered intact the following day. Unfortunately, two of the plummeting nuclear bombs' parachutes failed to open. That morning, Spanish farmer Pedro Alarcón was walking to his house with his grandchildren when one of the nuclear bombs landed in his tomato field and blew apart on impact. We were blown flat. The children started to cry. I was paralysed with fear. A stone hit me in the stomach, I thought I'd been killed. I lay there feeling like death with the children crying, he told the BBC in 1968. The other hydrogen bomb also exploded when it hit the ground near a cemetery. These dual blasts created vast craters and scattered highly toxic, radioactive plutonium dust across several hundred acres. Burning aircraft debris also showered the Spanish village. I was crying and running about, a villager called Señora Flores told the BBC in 1968. My little girl was crying, 'Mama, Mama, look at our house, it is burning.' Because of all the smoke I thought what she said must be true. There were a lot of stones and debris falling around us. I thought it would hit us. It was this terrific explosion. We thought it was the end of the world. Once the news that the bomber had come down with nuclear weapons aboard reached US military command, a huge operation was launched. At the time of the disaster, Capt Joe Ramirez was an US Air Force lawyer stationed in Madrid. There were a lot of people talking, there was a lot of excitement in the conference room. Everyone kept talking about a 'broken arrow'. I learnt then that 'broken arrow' was the code word for a nuclear accident, he told BBC'sWitness Historyin 2011. US military personnel were scrambled to the area by helicopter. When Capt Ramirez arrived in Palomares, he immediately saw the devastation and chaos wrought by the accident. Huge pieces of smoking wreckage were strewn all over the area – a large part of the burning B-52 bomber had landed in the school's yard. It's a small village but there were people scrambling in different directions. I could see smouldering debris, I could see some fires. Despite the carnage, miraculously no one in the village was killed. Nearly 100 tonnes of flaming debris had fallen on the village but not even a chicken had died, said Brasher. A local school teacher and doctor climbed up to the fire-scarred hillside to retrieve the remains of the US airmen who had been killed. Later still, they sorted the pieces and the limbs into five coffins, an act that was to cause a certain amount of bureaucratic difficulty when the Americans came to claim only four bodies from that hillside, said Brasher. Three of the B-52 crew who managed to eject landed in the Mediterranean several miles off the coast and were rescued by local fishing boats within an hour of the accident. The fourth, the B-52 radar-navigator, ejected through the plane's explosion, which left him badly burned, and was unable to separate himself from his ejection seat. Despite this, he managed to open his parachute and was found alive near the village and taken to hospital. However, this still left the problem of locating the plane's deadly nuclear payload. My main concern was to recover those bombs, that was number-one priority, Gen Wilson told the BBC in 1968. The first night, the Guardia Civil [the Spanish national police force] had come to the little bar in Palomares, and that was about the only place that had electricity. And they had reported what they considered to be a bomb, so we immediately despatched some of our people to this riverbed which is not far from the centre of town, and, in fact, it was a bomb, so we placed a guard on that. And then the next morning, at first daylight, we started conducting our search, and I believe it was something in the order of 10am or 11am the following morning, we located two other bombs. This accounted for three of the nuclear bombs, but there was still one missing. By the next day, trucks filled with US troops had been sent from nearby bases, with the beach in Palomares becoming a base for some 700 US airmen and scientists urgently trying to contain any radioactive contamination and locate the fourth warhead. The first thing that you could see as the search really got underway in earnest was Air Force personnel linking up hand-by-hand and 40 or 50 people in a line. They would have designated search areas. There were some people with Geiger counters who started arriving, and so they started marking off the areas which were contaminated, said Capt Ramirez in 2011. When US personnel registered an area contaminated with radiation, they would scrape up the first three inches of topsoil and seal it in barrels to be shipped back to the US. Some 1,400 tonnes of irradiated soil ended up being sent to a storage facility in South Carolina. More like this: •How a US general nearly started a nuclear war in 1950 •The greatest sailing rescue ever made •How Russia launched a giant space mirror in 1993 Both the US and Spain, which at the time was under the brutal rule of Francisco Franco's military dictatorship, were keen to downplay the devastating accident. Franco was especially worried that radiation fears would hurt Spain's tourism industry, a major source of revenue for his regime. In an effort to reassure the local population and the wider world that there was no danger, the US Ambassador to Spain, Angier Biddle Duke, would end uptaking a swimin the sea off Palomares coast in front of the international press just weeks after the accident. But despite hundreds of US personnel conducting an intensive and meticulous search of the surrounding area for a week, they still couldn't find the fourth bomb. Then Capt Ramirez spoke to a local fisherman who had helped rescue some of the surviving airmen who had splashed down in the sea. The fisherman kept apologising to Capt Ramirez for not being able to save one of the US flyers, whom he thought he had witnessed drifting down into the depths. Capt Ramirez realised that the fisherman could have actually seen the missing nuclear bomb. All the bodies had been accounted for, I knew that, he said. The search then quickly shifted to the Mediterranean Sea, with the US Navy mobilising a flotilla of more than 30 ships, including mine-sweepers and submersibles, to scour the seabed. The exploration of miles of ocean floor was both technically complicated and a very slow process, but after weeks of exhaustive searching, a newly developed deep-diving vessel, Alvin, finally located the missing bomb in an underwater trench. Nearly four months after it was first lost, the warhead was finally made safe and back in US hands. The next day, despite the secrecy with which the US military had surrounding its nuclear arsenal, it took the unusual step of showing the bomb to the world's press. Ambassador Duke reasoned that unless people saw the bomb for themselves, they would never feel certain that it had actually been recovered. Almost six decades later, the incident still casts a long shadow over the Almería region. TheUS clean-up operationmanaged to miss some areas of contamination, and the US and Spain agreed to fund yearly health-checks for Palomares residents. They also promised to monitor the soil, the water, the air and local crops. But there are still some 100 acres (40 hectares) of contaminated land in Palomares that remain fenced off. And despite Spain and the US signing amutual agreementin 2015 to clean up the area, neither has yet complied. -- For more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to theIn History newsletter, whileThe Essential Listdelivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

    "content": "Gates and Paul Allen launched computing giant Microsoft 50 years ago. In 1993, he talked to the BBC about the online innovations that would define the 21st Century. When the BBC first broadcast an interview with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates in June 1993, there were thought to be only130websites in total. The BBC's venerable science programmeHorizonwas investigating the new Electronic Frontier, in an era where information is starting to redefine our world, its geography and its economy. Gates told the programme: This is the information age, and the computer is the tool of the information age and software is what will determine how easily we can get at all of that information. Viewers could send off a cheque for £2 and receive a transcript of the programme in the post. The computer industry had already grown faster than any in history, but the key to future profits was creating something portable and user-friendly. The programme asked: Do we need endless information, or do they just need to sell it to us? In a world where a list of almost every website could fit on two sides of a sheet of paper, the world wide web did not even get a mention. However, the ideas explored in the programme are often far ahead of their time. In the early days of Microsoft, Bill Gates and Paul Allenset a goalof having a computer on every desk and in every home – all running Microsoft products, of course. They first met as children at a private school in Seattle, where they discovered a shared love of computers. Both went on to college but dropped out and created Microsoft, so-called because it provided microcomputer software. The company'sbig breakcame in 1980 when Microsoft agreed to produce the operating system for the personal computer being developed by IBM, the world's leading computer company at the time. In a stroke of business genius, Microsoft was allowed to license the operating system to other manufacturers, spawning an industry of IBM-compatible personal computers which depended on its MS-DOS product. The money had begun toroll in– and to this day it has not yet stopped. While Gates was the serious-minded computer nerd, Allen was his offbeat big brother. Allen worked at Microsoft until 1983, stepping away from the frontline following a diagnosis of blood cancer. He recovered to become a successful venture capitalist and, having held onto his share of the company, he was a fixture on the world's rich lists untilhis deathin 2018 at the age of 65. He used his vast fortune to invest in his personal passions, owning both the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team and Seattle Seahawks NFL team, who won the Super Bowl in 2013. His departure from Microsoft also meant that he had more time to perfect his guitar moves. Legendary music producer Quincy Jones even claimed in amagazine interviewthat Allen sings and plays just like Hendrix. He said: I went on a trip on his yacht, and he had David Crosby, Joe Walsh, Sean Lennon... then on the last two days, Stevie Wonder came on with his band and made Paul come up and play with him – he's good, man. The design of Seattle'sMuseum of Pop Culture, which he founded, has been likened to a smashed guitar and was created by superstar architect Frank Gehry. Allen jumped ship from Microsoft before products such as Windows, Excel and Word ever made it into the world's homes and offices. By the early 1990s, Gates' vision for networked computers sent sales and profits soaring. However, the pair's early dream of putting a computer running Microsoft software in every home and business was only half complete. Word processing and spreadsheets were lucrative, but Microsoft's relentless drive to expand needed new worlds to explore. The next step was to bring multimedia into people's homes, turning the personal computer into a communication device. It was the world of leisure so beloved by Allen that Gates needed to tap into. Gates acknowledged to the BBC in 1993 that the home will be a tougher frontier to conquer. However, he was confident that Microsoft would succeed. If you take a time frame like 15 years or certainly 20 years, I have no doubt that the vision of a computer in every home, although it won't look like today's computer, will absolutely be achieved, he said. A year earlier, Bruce Springsteen had ahitgrumbling about having 57 Channels (And Nothin' On). Undeterred by the Boss's cynicism, Microsoft'sNathan Myhrvoldtalked of a future where we would have up to 1,000 television channels. He said: That might sound like a nightmare, but I think it's a wonderful thing. Imagine what your favourite bookstore would be like if there were only five books. Describing a system resembling today's streaming services, he spoke of an online interactive guide, which uses computer technology to organise the channels, show them to you by topic, even learn of the material that you like to watch, and then present it to you in an online fashion right on the television. Myhrvold was providing a tantalising glimpse of the future: a world at your fingertips where you could order anEn VogueCD or Prince tickets instantly. But what would this mean for personal privacy? There was a warning in the 1993 programme from Denise Caruso, editor of the magazineDigital Media: The ease of sitting in front of your interactive TV five years hence and being able to order something by pushing your remote control means information about you is going through a network. That means that whoever is on the other end of that network knows what you're watching on television, can get your credit card number, can know lots of things about you that maybe you don't want them to know. Caruso raised issues echoed in the current debate aboutGenerative AImodels being trained by devouring copyrighted material. She said: By making information a commodity, you really change the nature of how people think about ideas and their work and what they do. I am a writer. My stock in trade is ideas, and when you try to draw lines around what information is and where did an idea come from and who had that idea originally and what napkin was it originally drawn on, when you start moving information into that realm, it starts to get very fuzzy about where one person's idea stops and another one starts. More like this: •A 36-year-old Jeff Bezos talks about 'unprofitable' Amazon •The rocky 1960s origins of online dating •How Russia launched a giant space mirror in 1993 She said that while information was an incredible commodity, it had no value at all unless it could be protected. But how could you protect something that has no physical existence and could be copied or changed undetectably? The problem is that the solutions are as complex as the problems themselves. Do you want to lock up all the information? Absolutely not. We would have no scientific progress if scientists weren't able to freely exchange ideas and information. Do you just have a free-for-all and say all information is free? Well, you can't do that either because people do actually make their livings upon the fruit of their work, [which] is information, whether it's a book or it's a movie or it's music. I think technology is an incredible thing and it's very powerful, but it's powerful in both ways, and it's very important that we all understand that before we just embrace it. While the world wide web did not feature in the programme, it was many viewers' first introduction to the concept of electronic mail, or email. As Microsoft continued its voracious expansion, the company's human resources vice-president Mike Murray said that email creates an electronic village [which] allows us to transcend the borders of time or geographic barriers. His words may seem grandiose now, but at the time it would have been a revolutionary idea that one could communicate instantly with someone or many people on the other side of the world without the need for an expensive international phone call. By the end of 1993, the number of websites was estimated at623, having doubled every three months. By the end of 1994, the figure was 10,022. Microsoft was seen by some commentators as beingslowto acknowledge the possibilities and growth of the web, but in May 1995 Gates sent amemoto his senior staff titled The Internet Tidal Wave, calling it the most important single development to come along since the IBM PC was introduced in 1981. Three months later, Microsoft launched its web portal MSN alongside the release of Windows 95. Some versions had its brand-new Internet Explorer browser controversially bundled in. The future was again up for grabs, and Gates once again had some big thoughts on how he might conquer it. -- For more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to theIn History newsletter, whileThe Essential Listdelivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

    "section": "culture",
    "content": "On 24 March 1944, 76 allied officers broke out of a German prisoner-of-war camp, Stalag Luft III – a mission that was memorialised in a classic film, The Great Escape. In 1977, a key member of the escape team, Ley Kenyon, was interviewed on the BBC's Nationwide. On a snowy moonless night in 1944, more than 200 allied officers attempted to break out of a German prisoner-of-war camp. It was the culmination of an incredibly ambitious plan that entailed more than a year of bribes, tunnelling, and the assembly-line production of equipment, uniforms and documents, all of which had to be painstakingly hidden from the camp's guards and spies. The Great Escape, John Sturges's 1963filmabout the breakout, is a much-loved classic starring Steve McQueen, Richard Attenborough and James Garner. But it contains many inaccuracies. Jem Duducu, historian and presenter of the Condensed History podcast, described it in an interview inMetroas a strange mixture of fastidious creation and pure Hollywood fantasy. The story was first told by Paul Brickhill, one of the people who helped with the escape attempt, in his 1950 book, The Great Escape. He describes Ley Kenyon, who illustrated the book, as the mission's star counterfeiter. Discussing the film with Dilys Morgan on the BBC's Nationwide in 1977, Kenyon said: It was good entertainment, but it certainly didn't express the real horror of being a prisoner of war, the horror being, of course, in one's personal feelings about being behind barbed wire – the boredom, the hunger. The hunger was pretty grim. Other ex-prisoners had a different view of the film. Charles Clarke, who was in the camp at the time, and had aided the plot as a look-out, told the BBC in a 2019radio interview: Even after all these years, I've always thought what a remarkable film it was. One major change that the film made was to the personnel involved. While the events of The Great Escape are mostly rooted in fact, names were changed, and various people were combined into composite characters. At the time of the escape, no Americans remained in the compound, and the man who was said to be the model for McQueen's Virgil Hilts,William Ash, did not take part. The plan was spearheaded by Squadron LeaderRoger Bushell– who in the film was renamed Bartlett, and played by Attenborough. First captured in 1940 after being shot down, Bushell had an impressive record of escape attempts, once getting within 100 yards of neutral Switzerland. Stalag Luft III was the Germans' attempt at an escape-proof camp, specifically for air force officers from the UK, Canada, Australia, Poland and other allied countries. It was built and run by the Luftwaffe as a secure place to hold people they believed were escape risks. What they had not done, however, was consider the ramifications of trapping so many escape experts in one place. The camp was built over sandy soil that was difficult to tunnel through. This subsoil was also lighter and more yellow than the dark topsoil, making it obvious if any appeared on the ground of the camp. Huts were perched on brick legs to make tunnels down from them obvious. Brickhill describes in his book a double barbed wire fence nine-feet (2.75m) high, just outside of which were 15-ft (4.5m) high goon-boxes every 100 yards or so, manned by sentries with searchlights and machine-guns. Additionally, microphones were buried in the ground around the wire so that they could pick up the sounds of any tunnelling. As you might expect from a plan hatched by soldiers, the tunnel-digging enterprise was run with military efficiency. Bushell – also known as Big X – was in charge, and delegated certain parts of the organisation to other men. The planning began even before Stalag Luft III was built: Bushell and others knew it was coming, and volunteered to help build it. As a result, they were able to map it out and pick the best spots for a tunnel. Bushell had the idea that they would dig not one tunnel but three simultaneously. The logic was that if the Germans found one of them, they would never suspect that there were two others. They were to be referred to only by their codenames of Tom, Dick and Harry. Bushell threatened to court-martial anyone who even uttered the word tunnel. The aim was for 200 men to escape. This was a colossal undertaking. Each man needed a set of civilian clothes, forged passes, a compass, food, and more. Some passes needed photographs, so a camera was smuggled in by a guard who had been bribed. In the film, Donald Pleasence's character is in charge of the forgery. In reality, Kenyon was one of the forgers who had to counterfeit the thousands of pieces of paperwork necessary. In the Nationwide interview, he recalled how they made it happen: We made a printing press, for one thing, and each letter had to be hand-carved out of rubber which we got from the cobbler – rubber heels – or bits of wood cut with razor blades. Every document had to be perfect. They replicated passes and paperwork that they had either stolen from the guards or persuaded the guards to show them. Something like 7 or 8,000 pieces of paper were produced, he said. The tunnels themselves were also miracles of engineering and ingenuity. An air pump was made with kit-bags and wood, and air was pumped through a line made of empty milk tins that had been sent by the Red Cross. A major issue was the dispersal of the soil that had been dug up, so bags that hung inside trousers were fashioned from long underwear and used to drop the sand around the camp, where it could be kicked into the ground. Of the three tunnels, Tom was discovered by the guards only a short while before it would have been completed. After a break, the decision was made to continue only with Harry. This tunnel was finished in the winter of 1943, and sealed up until conditions were suitable for a breakout. That time finally came on the night of 24 March 1944. Many things went wrong, but ultimately, of the 220 people chosen, 76 made it out before the 77th was spotted by a guard. A massive operation was mobilised to recapture the 76. They all knew that it was likely that they would be caught, but many viewed it as their duty to attempt escape. Another goal of the men was to make the Germans pull resources from their war effort to guard and search for them. According to Brickhill, five million Germans were involved in the search for the escaped prisoners. All but three of the 76 were recaptured. Two managed to make it to Sweden, and one to Spain. Hitler wanted all 73 of the recaptured prisoners to be shot. Those around him managed to talk him out of it – after all, the British held German prisoners of war, and would not take kindly to the massacre of their officers. Still, Hitler declared that 50 of them should die.Ken Rees, who was in the tunnel when it was discovered, recounted hearing that those murdered were taken out in twos and threes, and shot, in a BBC Witness History podcast in 2010. In the fictionalised version, all of the men are driven to a field and shot by a machine-gun, but the reality involved more deceitful measures. Brickhill's book notes that the men were taken in small groups in the direction of the original camp and shot on the way. He wrote, The shootings will be explained by the fact that the recaptured officers were shot while trying to escape, or because they offered resistance, so that nothing can be proved later. All of the bodies were cremated, and, as Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden pointed out in a parliamentary speech given in June 1944, the only reason for this would have been to hide the manner of death. Bushell was one of the men caught and murdered. He died aged 33. Details of his death came out in the investigation afterwards: along with his escape partner, he was shot in the back by Gestapo officers. His ashes were returned to the camp with the rest of the dead, but, according to his niece, the casket was broken when armies advanced on the camp, and so, more than 80 years later, he remains there. More like this: •How music saved a cellist's life in Auschwitz •How WW2's D-Day began with a death-defying mission •How Oskar Schindler saved 1,200 Jewish People during World War Two Two of the men who managed to avoid execution were Jimmy James and Sydney Dowse. In a 2012documentary, Dowse gave his perspective as a survivor. You rather wonder why the hell you yourself weren't shot. That's what Jimmy and I felt, anyway. Why we weren't shot. We could have been. It was just luck. And… pretty terrible. The execution of 50 prisoners of war caused outrage in the UK. Eden said in hisspeech to Parliament: His Majesty's Government must, therefore, record their solemn protest against these cold-blooded acts of butchery. They will never cease in their efforts to collect the evidence to identify all those responsible. They are firmly resolved that these foul criminals shall be tracked down to the last man wherever they may take refuge. When the war is over they will be brought to exemplary justice. After the war, a huge effort was put into investigating the killings. As a result, the details emerged, and 13 Gestapo officers were hanged for their part in the executions. It was only six years after the escape, in 1950, that Brickhill published his account of it, which was subsequently adapted into the famous film. When Charles Clarke was asked about his opinion of the Hollywood version of events, he said, Without the film, who would remember what a magnificent achievement it was? -- For more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to theIn History newsletter, whileThe Essential Listdelivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

    "content": "Stylish and experimental, Breathless heralded a new era of film-making when it was released 65 years ago. In 1964, its director told the BBC why he broke every rule he could. Jean-Luc Godard was crystal clear about what he planned to do with his feature-length film debut, Breathless (À bout de souffle), which was released 65 years ago this month. He wanted to blow up the whole idea of what cinema was. In 1964, the director told the BBC's Olivier Todd: It was a film which took everything the cinema had done – girls, gangsters, cars – exploded all this and put an end once and for all to the old style. Stylish and semi-improvised,Breathlessseemed revolutionary when it hit French screens on 16 March 1960. With its fragmented editing, offbeat dialogue and nonchalant approach to storytelling, it helped rewrite the language of modern cinema. As renowned US film criticRoger Ebertwrote: No debut film since Citizen Kane in 1942 has been as influential. On its surface, Breathless's plot resembles that of a hard-boiled crime thriller. It tells the story of amoral, impulsive petty criminal Michel Poiccard (played by Jean-Paul Belmondo) and his doomed relationship with the enigmatic Patricia Franchini (Jean Seberg), an American journalism student living in Paris. The film's plot plays out as Michel tries to evade arrest after murdering a policeman: he struggles to collect the money necessary to fund his escape and to convince the ambivalent Patricia to flee with him to Italy. But its director was not so much concerned with its crime narrative as he was with shattering cinematic conventions. Born in 1930 to wealthy Franco-Swiss parents,Godardhad spent the decade preceding Breathless's release immersed in cinema. At the beginning of the 1950s he had begun working as a film critic for the influential French magazine Cahiers du Cinéma. When he started, French cinema was dominated by studio-produced literary adaptations which valued polished storytelling over innovation. Godard, along with his fellow cinephiles at the magazine, railed against these films, arguing that they failed to capture any real emotion or show how people really behaved. At the same time, US films that had been banned during the Nazi occupation were being shown in French cinemas. Following the Second World War, France had signed the Blum-Byrnes agreements which had opened up its markets to US products in return for eradicating its war debt. This led to a flood of US films that were enthusiastically embraced by these young French critics. They especially admired westerns and detective thrillers – genres they regarded as critically underappreciated. It was Italian-born French film critic Nino Frank who coined the term film noir or dark film. The Cahiers du Cinéma writers also revered film-makers who could stamp their own unique creative visions onto Hollywood productions, such as Orson Welles, Alfred Hitchcock and Howard Hawks. They regarded these directors as the true auteurs or authors of those films, rather than the studio which produced them or the stars who appeared in them. Throughout the 1950s, these critics would debate and discuss the shortcomings of French cinema while developing their own ideas of what it should be. Many of the writers Godard worked alongside at Cahiers du Cinéma, such as François Truffaut, Éric Rohmer and Claude Chabrol, would also end up becoming directors and leading proponents of the influential movement that would become known as La Nouvelle Vague (The New Wave). With Breathless, Godard saw his chance to put the ideas he and his friends discussed into practice. He explained to the BBC in 1964 that he purposely set out to break rules he felt were holding back cinema. Conventions were exploded to make something with the remains, just as the debris is collected after an explosion. And when there is nothing useful left, we can start from scratch on fresh ground, he said. The film's story was written by Truffaut, who based it loosely on a 1952 news article about a Paris criminal, Michel Portail. However, when Godard came to filming, he would pretty much abandon Truffaut's script. Instead, he got his actors to improvise scenes, or he would feed them lines from behind the camera while filming. This gave the dialogue a spontaneous and personal feel. But it meant that much of Breathless needed to be shot sequentially, so Belmondo and Seberg would know what had happened earlier in the story. Due to its limited budget, Godard's plan was to make the cheapest film possible. So instead of shooting in a studio where he would be able to control the lighting, the sound and the set, he took to the streets of Paris with his cinematographer, Raoul Coutard, who filmed on location using a lightweight handheld camera and relying on natural light. The camera, while portable and effective at filming in low-light conditions, was both noisy and unable to record synchronised sound. This meant that nearly all of the improvised lines of dialogue needed to be written down as Belmondo and Seberg ad-libbed, and then dubbed in post-production. This resulted in the later recorded dialogue often not matching the actors' lips, leading to debates that continue to this day about what the characters are actually saying. Because much of Breathless's guerilla-style filming was done without permits or permission, random people going about their everyday lives in Paris's bustling streets and cafes were often captured in shot, lending an authenticity to its depiction of life in the city. Coutard had been a war photographer, and his reportage style of filming captured an immediacy and intimacy that made the film seem, at times, documentary-like. His camera moves restlessly around, capturing small everyday moments as the characters meet, talk and hang out. Sometimes the camera almost seems to be a participant in the action, sitting in the passenger seat of the car Michel has just stolen while he talks to it as if it were a friend. Breathless's lack of a conventional film crew added to its inventiveness. One of its most famous scenes, where Michel and Patricia are seen walking down the Champs-Élysées chatting as she advertises a newspaper, was achieved by Godard pulling Coutard along in a wheelchair while he filmed the actors walking towards him. The freedom of shooting on the Champs-Élysées, Jean Seberg walking down the curb with her unforgettable chanting, 'New York Herald Tribune'. It was like the invention of a mythology for me, the Italian director of Last Tango in Paris and The Last Emperor, Bernardo Bertolucci, told the BBC'sThe Film Programmein 2009. But Godard wasn't trying to convince audiences that they were seeing unfiltered reality. He had been influenced by the German playwright Bertolt Brecht, who believed that a story could so absorb an audience that they became passive and unthinking. So, to keep viewers critically engaged, Brecht would remind them that they were watching a play and not real life. Godard embraced this idea, using a range of stylistic devices to make it impossible for viewers to forget that they were watching a film. Characters regularly break the fourth wall, addressing their dialogue directly to the audience. Often, they comment on their own situation, shaking the viewer's feeling of being an unseen spectator. And while a typical film's soundtrack subtly suggests the mood of a scene, in Breathless the music starts and stops suddenly, often disconnected from what is happening on screen at the time. But it was Godard's rejection of the usual cinematic editing rules that would become the signature of the film. I was incredibly passionate about the style, the language of À bout de souffle, Bertolucci told the BBC. There were these jump cuts, for example. At school they were always telling you how to avoid jump cuts which were considered mistakes, and the movie was full of jump cuts. Breathless's use of jump cuts – abrupt transitions forward in time within the same scene – came about partly by accident. The finished film turned out to be much longer than intended, and Godard needed a way to cut it down to a manageable length. But instead of dropping whole scenes or sequences, the director chose to condense its running time by cutting out sections within takes. Often, he removes material from a continuous shot of movement or dialogue while making no attempt to match the edits, breaking the viewer's immersion in the film and giving it an energetic, skittish rhythm. This jittery editing style lent Breathless a feeling of unpredictability, grabbing the audience's attention and forcing them to be aware of the film-making process. Godard also did this by referencing other films, while at the same time subverting the very conventions that make those films work. Otto Preminger's 1950 film noir thriller Whirlpool is playing when Patricia enters a cinema in an effort to lose the police trailing her. In another scene, when she looks through a rolled-up poster at Michel, the shot mimics a scene in the western Forty Guns (1957) which is seen through a gun barrel. The admired French director of gangster films, Jean-Pierre Melville, has a cameo appearance playing a fictional celebrity author, while Godard himself crops up as a bystander on the street who recognises the fugitive Michel from the newspaper articles. In another homage to Godard's influences, the protagonist, Michel, dresses like his hero Humphrey Bogart and practises trying to emulate his onscreen mannerisms. At one point, while gazing at the poster for Bogart's last film, The Harder They Fall (1956), he whispers Bogey in admiration. But Michel's behaviour, unlike that of a Bogart hero, comes across as neither heroic nor courageous. He displays no conscience over his crimes or remorse over his actions. His girlfriend, Patricia, who goes on to betray him to the police, could be seen as a classic femme fatale character, but instead of being driven by passion, their relationship seems oddly detached and her motives remain opaque. The meaning in Breathless is never simply spelt out for its audience, and its freewheeling plot and morally ambiguous characters provide no easy answers. The film leaves it to the viewer to come to their own interpretations and judgements. More like this: •How Easy Rider revolutionised Hollywood •The classic western that made Clint Eastwood a star •The cult erotic film that became a global hit With its distinctive storytelling, imaginative camerawork andphotogenicyoung leads, who imbued it with an effortless sense of cool, Breathless was an immediate critical and commercial hit. It seemed to capture the mood of the times and people flocked to see it. They were in a sense ready for it, Professor James Williams told Kirsty Lang on the BBC'sLast Wordin 2022. I mean, people wanted something new and different. It would go on to win Godard the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 1960 Berlin International Film Festival. For the aspiring directors who saw Breathless, its effect was electric. As a potential film-maker, it was like just being free, it was like being on a drug or something. It was just amazing, Get Carter's director Mike Hodges told the BBC'sThe Film Programmein 2006. It broke all the rules – and rules of film-making are quite frightening in many ways. You've got to get the angles right, and you have lines that you don't cross. This was in the classical tradition. So in a sense, cinema was very like the classical painters, whereas when you saw Godard's film, it was like the impressionists coming to life, but on the screen. Breathless's impact would be felt in many of the US films that followed its release, with Godard influencing the Hollywood studios that had so affected him. Breathless's characters' moral ambiguity and its abrupt shifts in tone could be seen inBonnie and Clyde(1967), its innovative camera angles and examination of relationship uncertainty were reflected inThe Graduate(1967), and its low-budget filming techniques and improvised dialogue were embraced inEasy Rider(1969). In the 1970s, a slew of young directors inspired by the French New Wave, such as Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas, would put their own singular auteur visions of cinema on the screen. The directorQuentin Tarantino, who named his production company A Band Apart, after Godard's 1964 film Bande à part, has long acknowledged the effect the director had on him. He toldFilm Commentin a 1994 interview that Godard did to movies what Bob Dylan did to music: they both revolutionised their forms. Part of Breathless'scontinuing influenceon film-makers is in persuading them that it is possible for the viewer to do just what Godard did. As Shaun of the Dead directorEdgar Wrightwrote afterGodard died in 2022: It was ironic that he himself revered the Hollywood studio film-making system, as perhaps no other director inspired as many people to just pick up a camera and start shooting. -- For more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to theIn History newsletter, whileThe Essential Listdelivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250307-how-oskar-schindler-saved-12000-jewish-people-in-ww2",
    "section": "culture",
    "content": "The Nazis carried out the final liquidation of the Kraków Jewish ghetto on 13 March 1943, an act of violence that shocked a factory owner into becoming a saviour. These events were depicted in Thomas Keneally's novel Schindler's Ark and Steven Spielberg's film Schindler's List. But in 1982, Keneally told the BBC that Oskar Schindler's story was handed to him during a chance meeting with a luggage salesman. Oskar Schindler was living in relative obscurity when his story was first featured on the BBC in 1964. Journalist Magnus Magnusson told viewers of the current affairs programme,Tonight: You may not have heard of him yet, but one day you will. Today, he lives in Germany; sick, unemployable and penniless. In fact, he lives on charity, but not the poor-box kind. The money that keeps him and his family alive comes from the 1,300 Jews whose lives he personally saved in the last war. Many of them are pledged to give one day's pay a year to the man they call the Scarlet Pimpernel of the concentration camps. Schindler was in the news that day because it had been announced that a Hollywood film called To the Last Hour was to be made about his life. It came about because a few years earlier, Holocaust survivor Poldek Pfefferberg had shared with MGM producer Martin Gosch the almost preposterous story of how he was among thousands saved by a Nazi war profiteer: a handsome, womanising drunk and wheeler-dealer from Czechoslovakia who had previously demonstrated few heroic qualities. While that particular film would get stuck permanently in development hell, in 1980 Pfefferberg had a chance meeting with an unsuspecting Australian writer that would change both their lives. Thomas Keneally was killing time at the end of a Los Angeles promotional trip (I was being put up in unaccustomed grandeur by my publishers at a big hotel in Beverly Hills) and window-shopping for a new briefcase before returning home to Sydney. He told the BBC'sDesert Island Discsin 1983 that the leather goods shop owner, being a good central European, came out to greet him and give him the hard sell. Keneally said: [Pfefferberg] did produce a very good briefcase, and while I was waiting for the charges to be cleared on my credit cards – they're very slow to clear Australian credit cards, I've noticed; it's the convict reputation – he began to talk to me about his wartime experience. He knew I was a writer, and he said, 'I've got a book for you. I was saved, but so was my wife, saved from Auschwitz by an extraordinary German, a big handsome Hitlerite dream of a man called Oskar Schindler. I have many Oskar Schindler documents. In the 1960s, a movie was nearly made about Oskar, and while we're waiting for your credit card to be cleared, have a look at this material.' He told his son to mind the shop, and he took me up to the bank on the corner, open on Saturdays. He talked them into running off photocopies of all this remarkable material, and at once I understood that here was a most astounding European character. One of those documents was what would become known as Schindler's list. The list is life, Keneally would go on to write in his best-selling novel Schindler's Ark, and all around its cramped margins lies the gulf. Pfefferberg was born into a Jewish family in Kraków, where he had worked as a high school teacher and physical education professor until 1939, when Germany invaded Poland. He joined the Polish army and was wounded in battle. He told Keneally that when Poland fell to the Nazis and was partitioned between Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union, he had to make atough decision: We officers had to decide to go east or west. I decided not to go east, even though I was Jewish. If I had, I would have been shot with all the other poor sons of bitch in Katyn Forest. He was imprisoned in the Kraków ghetto, a segregated area established in 1941 by the Nazis. About 15,000 Jewish people were herded into an area that previously housed about 3,000 residents, and forced to live in dehumanising conditions. It was also in Kraków that the Nazi Party member Oskar Schindler was exploiting wartime misery for money, taking over several confiscated Jewish-owned businesses including an enamelware factory. At first, most of Schindler's workers were non-Jewish Poles, but he later began to employ Jewish forced labourers from the ghetto. Pfefferberg became one of his employees. Meanwhile, the Nazis began rounding up groups of Jewish people at gunpoint and deporting them to nearby concentration camps. For those left behind, it was a time of terror. Schindler was forever changed in March 1943 by the brutality of the Nazis' final liquidation of the Kraków ghetto. Those deemed able to work were transported to the nearby Płaszów labour camp. Thousands more who were considered unfit for work were either murdered in the streets or sent to the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. To save his workers from the camps, Schindler turned to using his talent for corruption and deceit. He continued to persuade Nazi officials that his workers were vital to the German war effort, bribing high-ranking SS officers with money and alcohol. His factory also produced ammunition shells to ensure it was regarded as a vital resource, and he listed the names, birthdates and skills of his Jewish workers, emphasising their importance to the Nazi war machine. Keneallytold the BBC: What he virtually did was set up a benign concentration camp, not once but twice, and he kept on losing his people and getting them back by bribery, by bluff, by corrupting officials, and by exploiting the extraordinary SS bureaucracy that was involved in a preposterously systematic manner in the Holocaust. More like this: •How music saved a cellist's life in Auschwitz •The man who saved 669 children from the Nazis •Anne Frank's father on his daughter's diary When the war ended, Schindler struggled with failed businesses and turned to alcohol. Those whom he had rescued would end up trying to rescue him, helping to support him financially. He died in 1974, aged 66. Survivors brought his remains to Israel, where he was buried in the Catholic Cemetery of Jerusalem. The inscription onhis gravereads: The unforgettable rescuer of 1,200 persecuted Jews. Among those saved were Pfefferberg and his wife Mila. After the war, the couple made their way to the US, and ended up in Beverly Hills. Pfefferberg sometimes went by the nameLeopold Page. Keneally noted in his 2008 memoirSearching for Schindlerthat this was a name foisted on him upon arrival atEllis Islandin 1947. Hetold the BBCthat writing this companion volume had been on his to-do list since Pfefferberg's death in 2001. I felt that, as big a character as Schindler was, the man who had brought me to him was also an extraordinary character, he said. When Steven Spielberg won the best director Oscar for Schindler's List at the 1994 Academy Awards, inhis speechhe said: This never could have gotten started without a survivor called Poldek Pfefferberg… All of us owe him such a debt. He has carried the story of Oskar Schindler to all of us. The film was based on Keneally's novel, Schindler's Ark, which won the UK's prestigiousBooker Prizein 1982. Some argued that it should not have been classified as fiction, as the author had applied imaginative literary techniques to real-life events in the manner ofworkssuch as Truman Capote's In Cold Blood and Tom Wolfe's The Right Stuff. Looking back in 2008, while discussing his Schindler memoir, Keneally told the BBC that the debate had been good for business. These days archbishops don't do writers the great benefit of banning them from the pulpit, but a literary controversy does nearly as well as the archbishops of the past did in promoting a book, he said. In hisBooker Prizeacceptance speech, Keneally thanked Pfefferberg and other survivors who helped him tell the story. He said: I'm in the extraordinary position that's akin to that of a Hollywood producer when he humbly accepts his Oscar, and thanks so many people. Normally a writer doesn't have to thank so many people, but most of my characters are still alive. And I'd also like to remember the extraordinary character whom Oskar was. -- For more stories and never-before-published radio scripts to your inbox, sign up to theIn History newsletter, whileThe Essential Listdelivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

    "section": "culture",
    "content": "A mother is on mission to make high school proms more affordable after her daughter missed two events due to Covid. Julie Sarahs launched a pop-up branch, called Stroud Community Costumes, which allows students to borrow dresses, suits, shoes and bags for a non-compulsory donation. She was inspired to take action after seeing the cost of some dresses rise to more than £200. If I can take away a little bit of the stress around this time when people are revising for exams, perhaps struggling financially or wanting to be a little bit sustainable with fashion then this is perfect for them, Ms Sarahs said. Ms Sarahs' daughter bought two dresses for as many proms, which were both cancelled during the pandemic. Those unworn prom dresses were the first to grace the rails at Stroud Community Costumes, which is now in its third year and has more than 100 dresses for teenagers to borrow. If people make a donation after borrowing an item, the money is used to buy more prom items for the shop, which is based in Stroud Library. If you want to borrow [a garment], all you have to do is give me your contact details and I run it on a trust basis that you will return it in a condition somebody else can borrow, Ms Sarahs said. Ms Sarahs said she was worried some students felt priced out of attending the event. If I can help by providing somebody with something to wear then that is great, she said. That frees up a little bit more time and money for them to go wild on hair, makeup, nails, accessories, fake tans, or [I can] try and reassure them that, actually, it doesn't have to be so over the top. Ms Sarahs added she would be very grateful for donations of shirts, suits and men's shoes for male students, as she does not have as many options for boys.

The Corinium Museum, in Cirencester, launched its Brickus Orpheus Trail on 15 April, which is part of the Project Orpheus partnership event between the museum, the Barn Theatre, and New Brewery Arts. Organised to mark the 200th anniversary of thediscovery of the Orpheus mosaic at Barton Farm in Cirencester, the event will run until 2 November. Mythical creatures, animals, gods and goddesses made of Lego are dotted around the trail. According to the museum, the mosaic was discovered in either 1824 or 1825. Thanks to his musical talents, Orpheus was said to be able to charm everyone and everything, from gods and goddesses, to animals and stones. The mosaic shows animals flocking around him. Emma Stuart, director of the Corinium Museum, said the Orpheus Trail explored the myth of Orpheus and his journey to the underworld. This is an exciting opportunity for our visitors to connect with Orpheus in a very contemporary way, she said. The Lego trail also features a figure of Orpheus' wife, Eurydice, who he tried to bring back from the dead with his music. The museum has also launched new workshops for schoolchildren based on Greek and Roman myths, as part of the project. Project Orpheus is funded by a grant from the National Lottery Fund, and a series of events will take place throughout the year at the Corinium Museum, the Barn Theatre and New Brewery Arts.

Weymouth and Portlandreceived a combined £60,000 from Dorset Council in funding as part of the new County of Culture scheme. Every year, the initiative, run by the Arts Development Company, sees a different town, village or hamlet in Dorset named as the host, with last year's winner being Bridport. The locally based not-for-profit arts organisation, B-Side, is working with both town councils to organise events for the next 12 months. This evening St Nics Gallery in Weymouth will host what organisers called an unforgettable evening of music, art and dance. Activities from ballet and brass bands to natural history walks, film clubs, DJ nights festivals and more are expected over the next year. Starting this weekend, there will be street performances in Weymouth Town Centre and a brass brand playing at the Portland High Angle Battery. Reveal is the name of this year's scheme, because the board said it wanted to uncover creativity and change the way that people conceive of towns that sit in rural or coastal settings. Director Rocca Holly-Nambi said: Our communities have so much to offer creatively, and our places are rich with culture.

    "section": "culture",
    "content": "Scotland's creative industries will suffer a massive blow unless the BBC reverses a decision to cancel soap opera River City, stars of the show have claimed. A number of actors from the programme were at the Scottish Parliament to hear a motion to save the show, which is due to end next year. Stephen Purdon, who has played Bob (previously 'Shellsuit Bob') in the show since it began, told BBC Scotland News the programme served as a pipeline for talent who could otherwise be lost to the industry. BBC Scotlandannounced the decision to axe the soaplast month, citing changes in audience behaviour away from long-running series. Past and present cast members - including Frank Gallagher, who played crime boss Lenny Murdoch, and Gary: Tank Commander star Scott Fletcher - held placards up outside Holyrood protesting the cancellation, before sitting in the parliament to listen to the motion, brought by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. Purdon, the only remaining original cast member from its 2002 launch, said the show was important for off-screen talent it nurtured as well as those on screen, emphasising the programme's training academy - which teaches participants through classes and workshops. He said: It's the only Scottish show that is constant throughout the year, and it's not just on screen. It's what goes on behind the scenes, like the training academy – it's a pathway into the industry for people who maybe don't otherwise have connections. A BBC spokesperson said training opportunities with River City would remain active until April 2026. BBC Scotland previously said it would increase total investment in drama over the next three years with a focus on world-class productions that can be sold internationally. However Purdon said short-term productions would not be able to replicate the consistency ofRiver City, and it would be a massive blow to the industry if the cancellation went ahead. He added: A six-part drama isn't going to constantly be there. It might be great for a short period of time, but for longevity, a show like River City is a conveyer belt [for talent]. Tom Urie, who was in the soap for four years from 2010 to 2014, toldthe BBC's Scotcast podcastthe show was now embedded into Scottish culture. He said: As an actor living in Scotland, it's an accessible ambition to have. If you look at something like Vigil, how would I ever get in that? But you look at River City, and you go maybe one day I'll get into River City because they'll want to do a story about a big guy trying to lose weight. It doesn't feel like something that'll be here for four months and then go away. The series, set in a fictional west of Scotland area called Shieldinch, is filmed on a specially-built set in Dumbarton and featured the likes of Outlander star Sam Heughan in early roles. Deacon Blue singer Lorraine McIntosh, Scottish acting veteran Johnny Beattie andEastEnders actor Alex Fernsalso took roles in the show. Bibby said he brought the motion in the hope it would encourage BBC Scotland to think again, and that he was particularly concerned over closure of the Dumbarton studio. He said: River City has been a platform and a pathway for young creative talent in Scotland. It's really important we have that platform, and I hope the BBC think again and maintain this iconic soap. The Scottish government's culture secretary Angus Robertson said during the debate the decision to end River City was more than regrettable and that it displayed a worrying trend in decision making that runs counter to the BBC's commitment to invest in the nations. Purdon admitted the cancellation would carry an emotional impact for him personally, too. He said: I'm 42 this year and I started when I was 19 so it means everything to me. I was there before I had my kids and now they see me on screen, so it's very important to me.",

People who started waiting as early as 06:00 BST on camping chairs were treated to a performance by Japanese drummers outside the new outlet in the Liverpool One precinct. One shopper, Ian Bradley, said he had even trimmed his beard for the event, adding: This is the biggest day of my year. The global brand said it was delighted to be in the heart of a vibrant and thriving city. Another shopper in the queue was Emma, who described herself as an adopted Scouser and said: I'm from London where Uniqlo has been for a long long time. I'm just so glad I no longer have to travel back as it is now in our wonderful city.

Dr Les Dolega, senior lecturer in geography and planning at the University of Liverpool, said the arrival of a big highstreet player at a time when retail stores were in decline was a positive development for the city. Last year the company suffered an online backlash in China after the boss of its parent company said the Japanese clothing retailer does not source cotton from Xinjiang, where the Chinese government denies using forced labour by people from the Muslim Uyghur minority in its production.

Elizabeth and Letitia, from West Sussex, are racing four other teams from China to India in the fifth series of the reality show, which launched on BBC1 on Wednesday. Doing it like this is something unexpected, unimaginable, and a once in a lifetime opportunity, Elizabeth told BBC Radio Sussex. It was a different way of trying to bond with a sibling, for sure, added the 33-year-old. Letitia, 26, admitted that they didn't really take it so seriously when they applied to take part in the programme, but were soon wondering if they were capable of completing the race. We watched it before and I thought 'we can do that, we like to travel', added Elizabeth. But actually doing it and being together 24/7, trying to make decisions together, is a different story. The contest sees the teams travel more than 8,700 miles (14,000km), starting from the Great Wall of China and traversing China, Nepal, and India without flights or smartphones. Contestants can only spend the cash equivalent of an airfare between the start and finish points, but the winners take home a £20,000 prize. Every day we were surprising ourselves, just being put in situations where you had to make difficult decisions, said Letitia. She added that, although the pair are very different, they were able to use this to their benefit in the race. We complemented each other along the way, she said. But sometimes, while we were going along, some of the differences did bring some conflict that we had to deal with. Follow BBC Sussex onFacebook, onX, and onInstagram.

Caroline and Tom Bridge, who live in Hargrave near Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, are one of five pairs competing in the fifth series of theBBC programme. The teams started their journey at The Great Wall of China and have to travel across three countries to become the first across the finish line, in a bid to win £20,000. Tom, 21, said: We didn't have any phones, and the language barrier was just impossible. It was so much harder than we thought it would be. The programme sees the teams race through about 8,700 miles (14,000 km) of Asia, through China, Nepal, and India. The aim is to be the first contestants to reach the finish line at the southernmost tip of India, in Kanyakumari, without using smartphones, bank cards or flights. Caroline, 60, said: I knew it was what I wanted - it was as if the programme was made for me. She said she was so excited to be told they had been selected to take part, and rang her son within seconds. From that moment in time it changed our lives, she added. The pair had told their family and friends they were travelling around Australia for two months whilst they were filming for the series. Tom said: The hardest thing was when we came back everyone was like 'how was Australia', and obviously we had not been, so it was hard to describe it. Tom had previously travelled around South America and Europe for a combined time of about 10 months, but his mother has never had the opportunity. Caroline said the experience was life changing and it was a fantastic feeling to travel without a phone.

    "content": "Presenter and journalist Kirsty Wark is to receive the Bafta fellowship, the British Academy's highest honour. The award recognises industry figures who have made an outstanding contribution to film, television or games. Wark, who presented BBC's Newsnight programme for 30 years until leaving last July, said: This is a wonderful surprise and a great honour. Television has been my home for 40 years... I continue to learn every day from people with awe-inspiring skills who have become treasured colleagues and dear friends. The news comes after it was revealed that EastEnders has been named recipient of the 2025 Bafta TV craft special award for its commitment to taking on and nurturing new talent off-screen. The BBC One soap was praised for its work on nurturing upcoming directors from under-represented groups, and offering writing and acting opportunities on its spin-off show, E20, which ran for three series. Scottish broadcaster Wark finds herself in good company among previous fellowship recipients, including Alfred Hitchcock, Steven Spielberg, Dame Judi Dench, Dame Vanessa Redgrave, Martin Scorsese, Sidney Poitier and Dame Helen Mirren. The most recent winners are actor and presenter Warwick Davis and composer Yoko Shimomura. Jane Millichip, CEO of Bafta, said: Kirsty's dedication is unwavering when it comes to telling the stories that really matter. She praised Wark's legacy, adding it is unmatched in the world of news and current affairs broadcasting, along with her ability to inform and engage her readers, listeners and viewers. She does all this with enormous charm and wit, she added.  Wark was described as a legend of British journalism by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair during her final Newsnight show in July 2024, while former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told her: To say you are a broadcasting titan... would be an understatement. It's hard to imagine that landscape without you. Wark spent more than 30 years presenting the long-running politics show but has remained working at the BBC, continuing to present Radio 4's The Reunion, Start the Week and Front Row on Radio 4. In September, she presented a Panorama special on the menopause industry, while last month, she fronted a two-part documentary on Scottish fashion called Icons of Style. She's also been working on her third novel. Wark joined the BBC as a graduate researcher in 1976 for BBC Radio Scotland, going on to become a producer in radio current affairs. After a spell on Radio 4's The World At One, she moved to television in 1983. She worked as a producer on Reporting Scotland. She was one of the first television journalists to arrive on the scene when Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up above Lockerbie in 1988. Two years later, she famously locked horns with Margaret Thatcher in a headline-making interview which propelled her into the national spotlight. She joined BBC Two's arts strand The Late Show as a presenter and then moved on to Newsnight in 1993. Her many famous interviewees over the years include George Clooney, ex-US president Bill Clinton, Damien Hirst, Madonna and Harold Pinter. Wark will collect the award at this year's Bafta TV Awards in London on 11 May. ",
